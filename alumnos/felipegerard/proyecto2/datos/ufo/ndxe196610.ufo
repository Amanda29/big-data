I was 10 years old at the time and was playing with my basketball when I looked down my street only to see what I just described. All six (6) crafts were only about 20 yards away, and only 30 feet above the ground, just above the tall pines. I stood motionless counting each craft (6 in all ) as they passed over and across the road. I will never forget that afternoon aaround dusk, as they were all such a brilliant radiant RED color that did not glow outwardly but instead was contained and with absolutly no noise. The whole incident lasted only about 30 - 45 seconds as they flew &amp; disapeared over the top of the tall pines. I immediatly ran into my house to tell my Mother who was intertaining a guest at the time. My Mother played it off as a hoaks and comainded me to leave the house while she intertained her guest. Ever sense that day I have been totally inquizitive with the whole phonamena of UFO&#39;s. I DO BELEIVE! I now live in the Fort Lauderdale area and have tried to stay on alert for more UFO&#39;s to no avail. I know now that nobody can relate to what I experienced that clear beautiful afternoon in Mississippi unless they saw it for themselves. E-mail me if you have had the same experience. I am interested in going public with my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

The ports were round and about 8 or 10 inches around. The flames came out from left to right,and left me with the impression flames were going around over and over below its mid section.I played in this area,it was an empty field with 3 feet high grass. Directly under the craft nothing was moving,but to the outside of its downward blasts the high grass was moving violantly.I could make out small lines that went around one side and met up with the other side.Now this left me seriously disturbed that night, it may of been great to see it,but I was only 11 years old.The next day I went out to get the local newspaper,&#34;The New Mexican&#34; for mom,she gave me the other sections of the paper,and there I found it,a farmer had taken a picture of what I saw,he had seen it the evening before and got it to the newspaper and they printed it.Well thats my real life event,and now I&#39;m 51 years old and want to tell what I saw.If anyone has access to the state librairy in Albuquerque you will have an opportunity to see what we saw.Just go do the research and post it here if possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I always sat in the Base Commander&#39;s Secretary&#39;s seat when she and him went to lunch.  I always read the &#34;Commander&#39;s Read File&#34; for the past 24 hours.  In it was the following report from the tower:  At approximately 0200 hours last night, a KC-97 was landing.  A bright light was noticed flying over the aircraft, shining a light downward on it.  It was picked up by radar and followed.  When the aircraft turned off onto the taxiway, the light went straight up at a high rate of speed, then sped off toward the North at an estimated speed of 15,000 MPH.  This light was seen by several radar operators and all personnel in the Control Tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was never announced in the Base or Local Newspapers.<n>

This apartment was adjacent to a house in a residential neighborhood, 3 blocks north of Central Avenue.  The moon was either full or nearly so.  This area of the city more or less overlooks the city, at least the beautiful Sandia Mountains can be seen from this address, and on a moonlit night, appear as a clear and distinct outline.  We had exited the car and were walking to the house when we saw the disk or saucer shaped craft traveling completely silently from west to east in a straight line, at a constant speed, and without pause.  As we observed the craft, us looking directly south, the craft was probably 30 to 35 degrees from our zenith, and was rotating counter clockwise looking from underneath.  I would estimate that the time required for a complete rotation was about 7 to 8 seconds.  The craft bottom was flat or a rounded form close to flat with no light. As a matter of fact, there was no lights on the craft with the exception of the port holes.  The sides seem to rise from the bottom at an angle of about 60 degrees to the horizontal and were the same around the circumference of the of the craft.  I would estimate that there were about 12 port around the circumference of the craft.  The distance was approximately 1/4 mile or perhaps a little more.  If there had been someone looking out of the port hole, we would have been able to clearly see them and wave to them.  We are not talking some distant light in the sky.  Top 1/3rd to 1/4th of the side seemed to rise to the top of the craft at an angle of about 45 degrees from the vertical.  I could not see the top of the craft.  In the early morning hours, at this location in the city, things were very quiet.  We heard no noise whatsoever. It floated quietly by and into the distance, over the Sandia Mountains. Some time later we were spending an evening with another couple and we shared this experience with them.  As it turns out, the wife had been leaving work at a nursing home on the east side of Albuquerque, and had seen this same craft on the same night.  So, there you have it, my one and only definite experience with a UFO.  None of us shared this experience with anyone; not police, government, air force, nor anyone else, except occasionally with friends, when conversation would drift into this area.  I have always felt very fortunate to have had this experience, and I remember it almost as clearly now, as I did the next day after it happened.  I just heard Peter Davenport on Art Bell&#39;s show( the very end),  and I felt inspired to share this experience. I just felt that this experience was &#34;my experience&#34;, and it was never important that anyone verify it, or agree with me, or even know that it happened.<n>
10/15/66 22:00|Fremont (Russian River)|CA||Varies|First UFO sightings as a teenager in the 1960's: three events|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84440.html|5|ndxe196610| First UFO sightings as a teenager in the 1960&#39;s: three events<n> <n><n> <n><n> My early UFO  experiences:  I believe I was 15, and that this was during the school year, in 1966 or 1967, on a weekend. I was living in Fremont, California, and my friends and I heard reports of UFOs leaving craters in the hills surrounding Fremont.  We determined to go check them out, and took off for a drive. S had a license and a car, so D, N, and I, and perhaps one other who I can’t recall exactly, drove out to the boonies. D, my best guy friend, and N, my best girlfriend, have stayed in touch over the years, and have said to one another on several occasions, &#34;That really happened, didn’t it?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We climbed up into the open hills, broke through some trees, and came to a large open field, with no sign of houses or buildings anywhere. In those days we even had dark skies in Fremont.  There was a small hill about 20 acres away.  On top of it were 2 large, very bright white lights. S was kind of the freaky type, and immediately turned the car around to escape.  But we convinced him to stop, so we could check this out, and we all got out of the car to look, standing at the back of it.  We were pondering reasonable explanations, when one of the lights suddenly floated straight up a short distance and stopped.  Then the second light floated up next to it, and as it arrived at that level, the first light started coming rapidly straight at us, followed right away by the second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> D and I were rather frozen. N actually raised her arms and said, &#34;I want to go with them.&#34;  starting to walk forward. S totally freaked and started running toward the driver’s seat. He was well known for erratic behavior and ditching people at the side of the road. I do think there was another person who ran to the car also. D and I had to grab N and drag her back to the revving car, S barely able to restrain himself. We zoomed back off the way we had come, towards the trees. N was angry and disappointed.  I recall looking out the back window and seeing them nearly on top of us as we entered the trees. The next thing I remember is all of us laughing wildly about how we had escaped them, especially S. I recall that we arrived home quite late, around 1:00 AM, and thinking that we must have gone farther out than we realized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following summer I was camping with the B family, who I spent most all I spent all my time with. They are a second family to me. We were at the American River, sitting on the bank. I spied a large, orange glowing light hovering over a hillside, and pointed it out to them. We watched the light slowly settle and disappear behind the trees. I was excited, but the parents quickly downplayed it, not wanting to scare the kids.  We headed back up to bed shortly after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone in a small tent, and I have a strong association of the color orange, likely the color of a pup tent back then.  I had just lay down, when I felt completely frozen, unable to move, like a great weight was upon me.  Then I felt, what I’d only been able to describe in the words of my time for downloading, that my brain was a tape, and everything about me was on it, and it was being reeled out of my head. I tried to resist the process and was &#34;“told&#34; rather sternly, &#34;Don’t try to resist, you know we can squash you like an ant.&#34;   So I submitted, scared to death. It seems that throughout this I was surrounded by orange, perhaps light shining through the tent. It took about as long as stripping a reel to reel tape at a quick steady speed.  Then it was over, the weight lifted, and I felt totally exhausted, drained. I explored my mind a great deal to be sure it was still intact. Then I fell asleep once reassured. Of course I told this story to others, but nobody really believe! d me, except perhaps D and N.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time school started, I was spending nearly all my time at B’s, hanging out and babysitting the kids after school. I had a dysfunctional home.  They lived at the outskirts of suburbia, in the farmland down a long, straight, dark road that eventually got to the main highway and the shopping center. Beyond the shopping center was the entrance to the suburb I lived in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every night I rode my bike home by the same route, leaving at a time that would get me home by 10:00, curfew.  I allowed a little extra time for distractions en route. I searched the sky a lot on the long, dark road. For about a week I started seeing odd vehicles resembling planes, but with a red, white, and bluish light that differed in color from the panes.  They were silent.  This was a well-traveled plane route, so there were many planes to compare with.  Each night I would see one pass one way or the other, each time a little lower in the sky. I began to be afraid, as it appeared they were coming for me. People started thinking I was crazy when I told them about these sightings, and I made them uncomfortable. One night I convinced D to make the trip with me. He saw one, and they were getting lower now. But he quickly and angrily dismissed it when I said I wanted him with me when they came, I didn’t want to be alone. Then he finally started treating me like I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, I made it past the dark road and through the shopping center, just entering the suburb, when I saw one again. The same lights, as low and as large as a 747 coming in for a landing, came gliding silently toward me, then stopped directly over my head.  I had stopped my bike with my foot on the ground, and looked up, studying this thing. It was black. I could clearly discern a kite type shape, with rounded edges, perhaps more like a Vick’s cough drop. The white light, positioned forward of the other two, seemed very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I knew, I was peddling as fast as I could, head down, not looking back, terrified. I was down the road a bit from where I’d stopped. I got home and immediately told my brother about it. He is a big autistic-genius-science geek who taught and teaches me all about the sky, as astronomy is his great obsession.  He and my oldest brother had taken a picture of a flying saucer in daylight years before, so I assumed he would hear me on this. He got angry, told me I was crazy and started treating me so. I just shut my mouth for good after that. I just had to live with this on my own. I was afraid to even look up at the sky for many years. The oddest thing was, even though I had zoomed home, I arrived 40 minutes late. I was never late. In fact, I should have been early if anything. I checked the time on our clock. It was correct. I thought there might be a problem with the B’s clock that I always used, but checked it the next day. It was fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what happened to me that night, only that it scared the wits out of me for a good long time.  When I finally got brave enough to search the skies again, I had many more strange sightings, and continue to do so to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This changed my focus all my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in the fall, I do not remember the exact time or date, so the are rough estimates.  My mother and I were driving over to the Pilot Rock, OR, area to meet my Dad and uncles there.  We were all staying in a large cabin .<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the road trip at night, my mom and I saw a distant orange light slowly approaching from our left side of the road.  It moved smoothly and steadily towards us.  It silently kept getting closer, its height matching the rolling hills and uneven terrain with a precise and unchanging  distance from the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother pulled our car off to the side of the road.  It was clear, I could see stars and there was dead silence, no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This oval, solid orange object came right up to us, never slowing down, moving very slowly.  (About the speed of a avarage running man).  I looked into it with awe, it had no markings, solid color, not even a variation of orange.  Its luminescence was not to bright that I could not look at it.  It was bright, but it did not illuminate much of the ground around it. It kept getting closer.  Close enough I think I could have hit it with a rock.  It compared in size to. Softball held at arms Length  from you.  It was about 20 feet off the ground.  I would guess it was about 40 ft in diameter (oval) and had a vertical length of about 10 ft (maybe slightly more) it had no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object continued to move steadily past us.  After it was out of sight, we got into our car and drive to the cabin.  I kept looking for it and notice it was trailing our right side in the trees lines quite a distance away.  I could see glimpse of it until we turned left onto a gravel road, drove a bit longer and we were at the cabin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never seen anything like it since.  I have only told my family until now.  My mom remembers and we talk about it once in a while, but she does not tell anyone.<n>

My family was getting ready to attend a National Honor Society induction for my older sister.  I was standing in the living room of our home and looking north through a large sliding glass door.  It was dark outside.  My father was a farmer, but he had received his &#34;wings&#34; from the USNavy during World War II.  He had done quite a bit of night flying and was trained in night flying by using the constellations. He was somewhat interested in the reports that pilots would see unusual objects, but he wasn&#39;t a nut.  He spent many hours alone on the tractor, cultivating soybean fields at night.  The evening of my UFO sighting,  my father was taking a bath.   I saw what at first looked like a large airliner over our neighbor&#39;s barn, but the &#34;airplane&#34; didn&#39;t move or appear to get closer and larger.  There were white lights that looked like windows of the plane, but the plane would have been way too low to be on approach to the Indianapolis (Weir Cook) airport.  The airport is located about 20 miles to the north west of my parents&#39; farm.  When I realized that this was not a jet, I shouted, &#34;Daddy, come quick.. It&#39;s a UFO! It&#39;s a UFO!&#34;  There had been several sightings around Indianapolis during the summer of 1965.   My father came running, with just a towel on.  The whole family tried to see the object, but it darted quickly to the west and disappeared.  I was the only person who really saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got to the high school, I was still rattled.  Then some of the other students said that the radio had reported that people saw a UFO over Southern Plaza, a shopping center located near US 31 on the south side of Indianapolis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They stood still and watched with amazement and later swore that they would tell no one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom felt like the beings operating the craft knew her thoughts, and that they meant business about her staying quiet. It was the weirdest thing I&#39;d ever heard.

As we admired the clear cool October sky, stars clear, moon bright and vivid, one of my family members pointed north just above the trees and said,&#34;look at that plane, its flying just above the trees&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone&#39;s attention focused on the flickering lights as they appoached, no one spoke another word as we were all trying to bring into focus an airplane. That never happened and so no one spoke because no one knew what it was, even after it passed over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft took a long time to arrive. I would estimate about 1 minute passed from the time we first saw it until the time it arrived over my Gradfathers&#39; house because it was moving so slow.  It was shaped like a plate, 3 times the size of my Grandfathers house, with strobe lights that went all the way around the craft changing from white around most of the craft to red, white, then red again before starting back to white.  As if 2 lights in the rear were red seperated by one pulse of white, then back to white all the way around the rest of the craft very rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was solid and the moonlight made the top of the craft appear a blue/white color and moved slowly and rose a bit to clear the higher ground and trees to the south of us over my aunt&#39;s house.  The craft was completely silent and was flying so slow I thought it would fall out of the sky on top of us at any moment.  That was my biggest fear at the time.  That it might just fall on us.  It was so big and slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have the benefit of having my parents and relatives there.  We discuss it occassionally and re-confirm what we all saw for our own edification and satisfaction.  If anyone else saw the craft, I woud love to hear about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin said it was Easter 1966, she might be right as she is a little older than me.  I think it was before Holloween in 1966, she disagrees.  I think my time is correct because I remember giving my book report to my class before the holidays and that spring of 1967  I was silent about UFOs because of the reaction I received.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a boy I had followed the US space program and knew I had seen nothing like this in my life up to that point or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 2004, while serving as a Police Advisor for the Department of State in Iraq, I met a gentleman who was a retired Air Force Officer and told him my childhood experience and he laughed and said I know exactly what you saw.  He called it the Lenticular Re-entry Device.  He told me it was a round craft, powered by electricity generated by a nuclear power plant with a crew of 5.  He said it remains classified to this day because of the power plant.  He told me the craft was an experimental craft that carried a crew of 5 and was capable of carrying 2 nulear ordinance weapons and could acheive low earth orbit up to 200,000 feet.  He drew mw a picture of it and it was similar but no way to say for sure it was the same thing I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember vividly the experience and the experience there after as I did my next book report at school on the subject of UFOs and what I learned was ridicule comes fast for having seen something extrodinary that no one else had seen.  I haven&#39;t spoke with many about it since then but those that were there with me at the time and the exception of others who have shared similar experiences as I had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I carry a camera with me everywhere and have for years now hoping that by chance I catch another glimpse of such an object and snap a photo but no such luck so far.  When your 12 years old you think, ok, I&#39;ll see another one soon, it was right there at Grandpas house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired Chief of Police now and served as a Police Advisor in Iraq and Afghanistan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My email address: ((e-address deleted)) if you have info about this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

While driving, I became aware of a light in the passenger side, front-seat window which persisted for some time.  At first I thought it was merely reflection from a farmhouse or barnyard light.  But after passing some houses, it continued.  Curious, I stopped the car alongside the road and got out so I could look over the top.  I saw the light about two hundred yards from the car in a field, maybe a hundred feet off the ground.  Immediately it shot straight up and faded out of sight, almost instantaneously.  Amazed, I excitedly got back into the car.  But my friend had seen nothing, and didn&#39;t want to discuss the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were sitting in a park when we notice the craft slowly fly over the top of us approximately 100&#39; above the ground.  It made no sound.  It was approximately 1/4 the size of a city block in circumference (approximately 100&#39;).  As it traveled away we could see that it was soucer shape.  The craft had markings on the bottom, but I can not remember exactly what they looked like.  We could see the shape easily because of the reflection of the street lights and the clear starry night sky.  We watched it follow the street (due south) for approximately one quarter mile it cruised at a speed of approximately 20 mph, at which point it made an immediate change in direction to the southwest and shot out of the sky into the atmosphere within about a second.  There were no lights or sound.  It was mid week and no one else was around.  There was no traffic or other witnesses that we know of.  Neither of us has mentioned this or reported this information.  To this day I have not seen anything that resembles the appearance of characteristics of this craft.  None of the characteristics below apply.<n>

I had a great love for the stars. each night I would stare at the stars. As I nightly looked out my window from my bed, I knew what I should see when I  looked. The night in question, when I lay down, I looked to my friends, the stars, there was a wrongness. The stars I expected were not there. I was mighty confused, but as I continued to look I saw that stars north of the wrongness were disapearing, and stars south of the wrongness were appearing. I realised that the stars I saw, that were wrong, were moving as a group, in a north north east dirrection. The &#34;group&#34; was moving, very slowly, blocking out the stars in an enormous area. I heard no sound from it. The &#34;group&#34; was made up of large, small, dim, and brighter &#34;stars&#34;. as if it were camafloging a huge craft from the casual observer. I would not have noticed, but I looked out the same window, at the same time, every night. And I looked to the stars as a consistant. I was extreamly excited, I ran to another window, but It was covered and could not see out. Now, I would try to get pictures, then, I went back to bed. I didn&#39;t even go outside. The next day I told my seventh grade english teacher, Mr ((name deleted)). He told me I was dreaming. That it was not true. But I knew what I saw. But because I choose to not be laughed at, I did not tell any one else. Till now.<n>

The DJ said he had recieved calls about a ufo over the town. We could see the light as we got closer to Anacortes. The DJ said he went out to look at it and traffic was stopped to look. We observed it until we had to turn at an intersection. While we were stopped the ufo,right above us, from a dead stop streaked of at ultra high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stationed at Whidbey Is. Naval Air Station 66-69. I was in a Squadron there in electronics. My friend and I had gone to Bellingham that evening to see our girlfriends. On the way back to base we were listening to an Anacortes radio station and about 20 miles from Anacortes the DJ started having phone calls to the station about a ufo over the town. He joked about it for awhile and then he went out to look for himself. He said everyone was looking at it even the traffic was stopped. So,we bgan to look ourselves. Sure enough we could see a stationary light above Anacortes, since we were heading straight for it. We observed this light for a good 10 minutes. It was the size of a car headlight at 100 yds. Altitude approx. 1000 feet. The night,10 pm, was a rare clear sky for that area. When we were abut 5 miles from Anacortes the road made a T and we came to a stop to turn back to Whidbey. The object was almost directly overhead slightly to the west. We were intently watching it as it seemed to hover there. After only a minute while still stopped the ufo shot straight west out of sight over the horizon. Tremendously fast, it only seemed like a second-literally. It was no jet no helicopter or any other manmade craft that I had ever seen. Never saw another one since. It really blew us away.<n>
10/1/66 20:00|Buffalo|NY|Light|4 minutes|One of the bright stars moved north, curved upward, flew in a wide arc, then accelerated up into the cosmos.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21125.html|18|ndxe196610| One of the bright stars moved north, curved upward, flew in a wide arc, then accelerated up into the cosmos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am fifty years old now.  At the time of the sighting I was fourteen.  The year was 1966.  I don&#39;t remember the day but it was before Columbus Day.  It was dark out and a was getting chillier as the night progressed.  I was playing hide-and-seek with lots of other kids from the neighborhood.  There were twelve of us playing.  During a break in the play I lagged behind the others, who&#39;d changed their minds about the present game but couldn&#39;t decide on another game.  I was on the Madison Street side of the Madison and Eagle crossroad, and had just gotten up from leaning on the fire hydrant.  I was different from my friends because I liked (and still do) to look at the sky.  This night was very clear.  The street lights weren&#39;t as bright as they are now, in 2002.  Besides, there were very large, old trees still standing. At this time of autumn almost half the leaves were gone.  The stars were very bright that night.  I almost forgot my friends as they were now past the middle of the block away from my position.  I was comparing the stars to the constellations I learned about in school and admiring their beauty, when one of them moved.  I thought it might be like other stars I&#39;d seen move before.  Only, the other stars I saw before would stop after only a short movement.  This star didn&#39;t stop.  It moved north for seven to nine of my quick paces as I followed it, and then it arced up!  The arc was wide as the star continued north.  Then I had to stop.  The star was moving up, first in a curved line, then a diagonal line, then it rose straight up.  The only star that was moving, remained very bright until it quickly picked up increasing speed and disappeared into the cosmos, leaving an envy in me for wherever it was going and a dread, knowing that if I told any one about what I&#39;d seen, the taunting and ridicule I&#39;d get would probably mess with my already weak confidence.  It took me this long to say something.  This was my first sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

Approached until object overhead as wide as road and ditch. Bright lights, Turned head to find object in horizon. in horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Labor Day, 1966 we were travelling to Saskatchewan for the holiday on Hwy 16 E about 30 miles out of town. My husband, myself, son almost two and I was pregnant.  Ahead we saw bright lights.  Since the road was straight, it was unusual.  We thought maybe a helecopter.  We slowed down and approached the lights.  As we got closer, we realized this object was very large and could not be anything we recognized.  We were going very slow as we approached this object.  It was very large.  It was as wide as a two lane highway with a curb and the ditch as well.  There were three rows of lights, the red being the most prominant.  We were calm and not frightned by this.  I was sitting up and looking up through the wind shield right under it and it was huge.  I told my husband to stop the car which he did.  I jumped out of the car, looked up and it was gone, and I could barely see it in the horizon.  The colors of the lights are vague, perhaps yellow or white, and green or blue.  The only sure color was red, for it seemed to be pulsing.  There were maybe 6 to 8 ports with lights in each color and 3 rows.  Less Rows on top to make the shape.  The lights were the only thing that gave it shape.  Like an upside down bowl. We continued on to Saskatchewan and mentioned it to my father and he had just read a book on UFO&#39;s and said it sounded like one.  I had never heard of such a thing.  Upon returning home to Alberta we ceased to talk about it, not to anyone, until one night a few months later, we had company, and we both realized that we had not told a sole.  So, we did.  Not long after this, both my husband and I were awoke in the middle of the night by a white light.  The house was light up like a flourescent light.  We lived by Half Moon Lake, and looked out to see what it could be.  There was a full moon that night, and the moon was reflecting on the lake.  The reflection of the moon was clear because it was a bit yellow, but there was another reflection, coming from where???  We phoned the Planitorium the next day to see if there had been a meterorite that night and they said no.  It was a frightning night!  After that, we basically left the experience alone.  I was due to have my baby in January, and while I was having her, I had a dream where I went some where.  It was so clear. There was someone talking to me and telling me why I had to go back. The doctors thought I may have had a near death experience, but I some- times wonder if it may have been from that experience.  I did go to a doctor and went under Hypnosis but nothing.  I always had the feeling that there had been more to this sighting that just seeing it. Myself and my two children all have Auto Immune diseases, myself, Multiple Sclerosis, My son, Chrones Disease and my Daughter a very serious Ulcerative Colitis. My daughter is a teacher, my son an Instrumentation Engineer and have done well academically.  I am unable to work.  This experience has never left my mind, and I am now living in the country and am always scared.  Jokingly I will say to my husband that I am sure in a good place for them to come at any time and check me out.  From my childhood, I have a good memory of an incident where I thought a &#34;Piece fell out of the Sky&#34; I wrote it down on a piece of paper and said I would retrieve it when I was a big girl and then people would believe me.  This is the first time I have told the Story and thought that it should be recorded some where.  I have since been divorced from the person driving the car, and have checked with him on different occasions to verify that it really did happen.  Another interesting thought was that at the time of the siting, we were not afraid at all. Also, when we were under it, I had my window opened, and there was not a sound.<n>
