It had brighter white lights on each point and dimmer lights at the midpoint of each side.  It was very low to the ground, lower than any normal plane would be traveling and it made absolutely no sound. It was traveling south pretty slowly; I took my eyes off of it to look back at the road to check my driving when I looked back it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

After watching a few minutes, it would stop suddenly and completely, then it would suddenly move again at what seemed to be a very high rate of speed.  When it started moving it would sometimes change its direction of travel and would even reverse its course.  It would move only a few degrees with each movement but after a time it had traveled across half the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first saw the light, it was near the left foot of the Orion constellation.  Even though it was changing course, its general direction of travel was to the north.  We have watched many airplanes and satellites travel in the night sky and this one moved like nothing we have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was incredibly bright. It was moving slowly north along the Oregon Coastal Mountain range.  It was a rainy cloudy night and the object appeared to be under the cloud cover and when the flash strobed it illuminated everything on the ground as bright as lightning as well as illuminating the underside of the stormy clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It left me with the impression that the object was using a super-bright flash to photograph the ground?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything quite like this!

Through binoculars, saw many mini lights fling out of larger star like object like so many star cinders into the night.  These &#34;cinder&#34; stars would swarm the orginal bright mother star like moths to a light bulb.  3 different formations of 3 each were spotted shortly there after floating above us.  We were around Standing Bear Lake as usual.  Through the binoculars star a fixed formation of stars shift in unison as if in a breeze.  They would shift for west to east, Then south, back west, then north again.  This uniform shift feature could only be seen with the binoculars looking straight up.  Unseen to naked eye.  Had the impression that this huge uniformity connected all the naked eye light orbs.  Estimated size of this new larger light craft could easily be 5 square blocks of craft below the low level cloud layer roughly 4,000 ft up.  Quite silent, and beautiful.  To the casual observer, un noticeable.  Look up Omaha.  They are here EVERY night.  Numerous cesna like craft attempted to fly through these formations and left after 19 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared stationary and further up than the airplanes in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see any strobe lights or any other flashing lights that airplanes usually have. The object appeared to travel straight away from me up and became very dim in the period of about 3 seconds and then became dim and traveled in a southern direction until it disappeared about 2 seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, this probably isn’t anything but I stargaze frequently and have never seen anything like this.<n>

Before I did I went to the back door to make sure its locked and I saw 3 bright reddish orangish things in the sky flickering like a candle. They were in the formation of a triangle and at first I thought it was the big dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I ran upstairs really quick and showed my uncle out his bathroom window and there were only two left but really spaced apart, yet they still kept flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for about 5 minutes and one of them slowly disappeared then the last one.  I left when they all vanished but my uncle said there were planes chasing them.  And that was the end of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until the next morning I forgot totally about it and one of my classmates brought it up. We talked about the sighting and we had the same exact description. She said she was with her boyfriend and a car full of people, so she knew she wasn’t crazy.

The object then started moving more quickly and crossed back over the freeway to the left side and over the town it was moving in strange patterns and very low to the city. we could see at this point that there were many more lights on the object that kept going crazy it then moved form over the town out towards the rural area to the north of the town and started to descend behind some trees there was then a bright flash of light at this point t! o more t wo objects stated heading towards the town at high speeds one from the south and one from the east the one from the east arrived first and hovered just a little ways outside the town and then dropped out of the air the second object from the south arrived as the first had dropped and hovered over the location the first had been it stayed hovering there for a minute or two and then it looked like it had burst into flames still hovering there after a minute the object vanished into nowhere after another minute the strange lights reappeared in the same location(the lights did not ascend or descend from any where they just reappeared like they were always there) only now the lights on the object were flashing alot and in what looked like streams it then started heading south at a high rate of speed untill we could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

Never before have a seen anything close to what I witnessed that night about a week ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up at the sky when I noticed what looked like a shooting star. I was about to even say &#34;Hey, look at that shooting star in front of us!,&#34; but before I said anything I noticed it had dramatically slowed down but had not disappeared. The object came to a halt and began to turn green, it started to grow and looked like a green fireball in the sky. It was round, and bright. It sort of began to look like a green traffic signal, but up in the sky. Then very suddenly it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a few more seconds I thought about what I had just seen in amazement. Then I proceeded to say &#34;Please tell me, I was not the only person who just saw that.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend who had been driving immediately replied that he saw it too, and that he could not believe his eyes. The third person claimed to have not seen anything, but admitted he was not looking forward where the event took place, but to the side out the window.<n>

As me and my son(13)was coming out of the Wal-Mart in Salem Virginia i looked up in the ski to the far south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I then told my son to look at that bright &#34;light&#34; in the sky.  We didn&#39;t see a shape but it look like one &#34;headlight&#34; in the sky traveling backwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first this &#34;light&#34; wasn&#39;t moving fast.  It actually look like it was just sitting still. Then we looked up a little higher and we saw three jets at first they look like they was just going across but then they starting racing towards the &#34;light&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were regular plane but they were too high and moving fast. Then the light&#34; starting moving south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the jets got closer to the &#34;light&#34; it stated to move faster.  So I told my son to get in the car because it&#39;s going in the direction we are going.  I could barely keep my eyes on the road because i was too busy looking up &#34;accident waiting to happen&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we travel south on 460 to the Elliston area the light started to slight disapear (it look like it was now some where past blacksburg area) then from the southeast we saw another jet or miltary plane moving fast in the same direction as the other 3 jets and the &#34;Light&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that i couldn&#39;t see any more because of the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was the i know the military was going after.   If i saw that &#34;Light&#39; i know others had to see it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am Christain and i believe in GOD and i don&#39;t believe in UFO or anything like that.  But after seeing what me and my son saw today make me think other wise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sometimes hear the miliatary planes fly over our area for training purposes but this time they were no-where to heard but only to be seen racing across the sky.<n>

I was looking at a few jets spewing out chemtrails when I noticed a silvery football shaped orb (w/no exhaust nor features).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear, blue bird sky with the exception of the chemtrails.  I yelled for my girlfriend to come outside and she spotted it also.  We both agreed it looked more like an oval, football shape with a silvery luminosity that stood out in contrast compared to the chemtrail jets that were close to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point in the beginning, I thought the object was going to crash into or nearly miss a chem trail jet as they approached each other from opposite directions.  I caught one good photo with my digital binoculars as it faded into the distance.  I and my girlfriend have filled reports with MUFON and I have spoken with the West Virginia MUFON investigator.<n>

Difficult to see was a small sphere like object, white in appearance and resembling a star but rounder edges. Two co-workers also saw the object.  It did not move for a period of at least 30 mins. It was very bright, sunny day, with wispy high clouds that moved fairly rapidly as it was quite windy.  My first thought that is was possibly a weather balloon.  It was difficult to spot, and the fourth person was not able to see it because of the bright sky, though the sun was behind and above us.  I took photos with my cell phone, but strangely there is the pole I used as a marker but instead of the very small object we were looking at there is an oval large bright light.  This happened in two consecutive photos. I was wondering if anyone else has reported anything like this today.  There was a tremendous amount of jet traffic and contrails in that sector of the sky. As far as I have checked there were no unusual celestial events going on either.  I thought I would go ahead and report this since we have had some ufo sightings in this area recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We just spoke with this witness, and we found her to be quite credible.  She had contacted the National Weather Service, and Carlswell AFB, attempting to determine whether they might have launched weather balloons, and they both reported that they had not done so.  We do not know what the witnesses observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the witness reported that there was quite a strong wind at ground level, and that the object appeared to the several witnesses to remain motionless for in excess of 30 minutes.

I thought it might have been a helecopter flying low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove closer to the light and it started to travel parallel along the tree line.  I followed it at about 50 mph.  It stayed just ahead of me but I could make out an oblong type object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2 miles it stopped  over a residential neighborhood and hovered in an open area without too many trees.  I pulled into a gas station and got a good look at it.  I got a spotlight out of my car and shined the light on the object.  The light barely hit it but I could really see it good.  It was an oblong type shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear cold night without any clouds.  As the light hit it, the object turned towards my location and flew at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rode the area for the next 30 minutes or so but never saw it again.

It struck me as odd because it was way too low to be a plane, but it was much larger then a helicopter and definitely not a blimp because the movement was very deliberate and faster then a blimp’s. It had 4 very bright white lights and 2 blinking red lights. I rolled down the window to see if I could identify it by the sound it made, but there was NO noise, it was completely silent! That when I pulled over to give it a harder look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was huge and flying slowly and very low, about 5 stories off the ground, and it was completely silent. It was shaped like either a giant diamond or triangle. I could clearly see the right angle that made up the nose and I could see that the sides also meet at a sharp angles but the back was obscured by the incredibly bright white lights so the shape of the rear was a little hard to make out. As it flew directly over me I could see that it was very dark gray with a black circle in the center. It pass over my head and then make a large arc in the sky and flew west back towards San Francisco. I watched it go over the horizon until it couldn’t see it anymore. The whole thing lasted about 12 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazed at what I had just see I got in my car and drove the remaining 6 blocks home. Then, when I was getting out of my car, I saw another one! This one was also silent but it was a little faster then the first and flew higher in the air, about 8 stories up. This one also had bright white and red lights but unlike the first one I could clearly see that it was triangle shaped. It followed the path of the first but made a slightly tighter arc and continued straight west. As I watched it go, I saw that it was flying towards another one that was far off in the horizon. It joined the other and they both flew north until I couldn’t see them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of my roommates believed me but know what I saw. Other people must have seen them too because they flew over very populated areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She had seen strange lights that looked like a very brite star.  I looked at window in sky and I could see alarge brite light in a shape of a circle.  It moved up and down and sideways. It seemed to shoot off straight sharp lights .  When the straight lights-which when it would shoot the end of the lights that were shot out seemed to end with a small burst.  It kept moving slow and it seemed to fall.  There was another one next to it doing the same thing.  A helicoper showed up and it seemed to dissapear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Did anyone else see this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> At exactly 9 pm (21:00 hrs) I was walking my friend out to his truck. It was a clear sky and the stars were very bright. I noticed a somewhat dim, amber light come into view. I have seen a hundred satellites in our desert sky. This was not a satellite. I am an amature astronomer as well and I understand the differences between objects within our atmosphere and those that are traveling out of it.  I saw the space station through my 12” Orion telescope this summer for 10 seconds along with the space shuttle with my own eyes (eye). This object was within our atmosphere and I would guess it to be about 20,000 to 30,000 feet in altitude. It was traveling comparatively, twice the visible speed as an average commercial airliner making it about 1200-1400 miles per hour. The object was a very elongated, narrow oval. It was traveling from East to West and was straight above my house when it came into view. The entire object glowed in a mildly bright, consistent amber color. There were no other lights on the craft. The light emitted was not flashing or blinking. I ran in to grab my binoculars and went out my back door which faces west to try and catch an up close glimpse. I was not successful. The object was gone from sight within 10 seconds. There were many other easily identifiable aircraft in the sky for the next 20 minutes flying with in 50 miles or so of the area of the craft’s path.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft was low it was moving slowly but not too slow, there was no sound coming from it, just dead silence. As we were following it in our car we took our phones out to record it but by the time we got our phones ready it disappeared right in front of our eyes. Two hours later other people heard the sound of a jet flying by, and this morning I also heard a jet flying by and earlier this evening there were traces of the smoke the jets leave in the sky, but the object we saw was not a jet because there was no noise coming from it what so ever and jets or airplanes don’t just disappear like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We looked once again and noticed a distinct disk like shape to the aircraft as it began to come closer and closer to our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to have two red lights and blue lights on what I can only assume would be the sides of the craft.  I could not tell what color the object was due to the dark skies, but there was a slight humming or buzzing noise that accompanied its movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch, what we now thought to be a UFO, fly over our heads and then without warning the craft left the area with amazing speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole incident has left me feeling confused and a little scared, when I found this site I knew I would be able to tell my story without the fear of others thinking I was crazy.<n>

I tried to look underneath but it was hard to see.  I remember that I saw a round bottom.  It was a triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were massive and were very bright. It was hard to see because of the brightness. All that was between us was a little church. We turned around to get a second look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared. For all I know it could have landed or took off super fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called up my friend who was right in front of us. They said “Hello” I was like “hey, did you just see that?” “Yeah!” She said.  After that, she described the same exact thing as I did.  So, we went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))<n>

We saw no apparent craft. The light was visible for 5 seconds, and then the light dimmed out and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would characterize the light as looking like a spotlight.  It was approximately 60 degrees in the sky.  I am 16 and go to high school my brother is 12 and attends junior high school<n>
2/27/08 19:10|Coral Springs|FL|Circle|4 minutes|moving stars in the early night|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62010.html|33|ndxe200802| moving stars in the early night<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7:10pm I was taking my son to the supermarket and as I always do I point up at the stars to him like planet Mars and Jupiter. I am an avid sky watcher so I know quite a bit about the night sky. I reguarly read Astronomy magazine and know what I am looking at and what to look for more than most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> clear night with nothing blocking a nice view of the stars and planets and satalites above. I know a satalite when I see one as the spin and reflect the light of the sun as they go accross the sky. I know the space station as I point it out to my son early morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what my wife, my son and I saw:<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was pointing out  the most visible of objects in the night sky like Mars we focused all of our attention on Mars it is clear as can be also very bright and red.  It was not moving at all as planets only can move as fast as the earth can spin.  Mars is what we really knew we were looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until it began to move in an od fassion from above to the North first slow almost un-noticable then abruptly it began an Easterly path for about 15 seconds slowly then rapidly began a southerly path before moving West then East again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is od very od planets, stars, satalites and Earthly airborn objects do not as we know yet move in this fassion yet.  The altitude of tje object apeared to be high so high it was mistaken orriginaly for Mars.  We all know Mars doesnt move from a stationary position above head directly to the North, East, South then West then East again.  The movement from each direction was abrupt and smooth with a clear scense of thought behind each action.  Nothing in nature can cause stars to move like this, planets or even satalite to move like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again the motion was stationary directly overhead 30 seconds for argument sake then slow movement to the North 15 seconds then to the East abruptly 15 seconds then to the South abeuptly for 15 seconds then to the West abruptly foe 15 seconds then to the East again abruptly for 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one minute East path was the final direction of the object after that 1 minute East the object began to speed up first slowly picked up speed then faster and then faster then even faster appearing to move East and get higher in altitude until disapearing before our eyes not over the horizon but up up and out of sight.  No clouds to hide behind no other thing up in the sky to mistake it for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what I saw my wife saw and my son who is very young saw.  But my wife and I are skepticle about UFO&#39;s due to the great distances needed to traverse in space-time.  This leads me to believe that what we saw was extraterestrial in its nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I have kept my head up and looking and again the very next evening at 8:45 I looked at my watch first then to the sky and saw a simmilar object, this time same type of object as far as brightness and size was moving north for 30-40 seconds before moving West then speeding off West and increasing altitude and disapearing into the clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again the following night I look upward at around 9:15 and see a much brighter object as seen the two previous evenings.  This object was 10 times the luminosity also same type of motion just brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Exactly the 3rd sighting goes like this I come home park the car and exit the vehicle.  I look up to admire the stars and I see clear as day a bright planet but this night it apears to have the luminosity of ten versus the previous two evenings this 3rd time the motion from up above to the north increasing altitude until disapearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note none of the sightings did the objects disapear over the horizon rather disapeared into a higher altitude vanishing.  No sound ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And again I am an avid sky watcher and know what I am looking at and what for. This is what leads my skepticle mind to believe what I have been seing for three nights to be a clear ET Event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do think again if I look up I will see again soething that others with fancy equipment could video tape and verify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an educated sky watcher and a skeptic due to the fantastic distances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Make note of what I have seen please as the next person to see what I&#39;ve seem won&#39;t think they are crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thank you kindly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> S<n>

And being that this area has been a crazy hotbed of activity I flew outside &amp; low &amp; behold there were 3 HUGE UFO&#39;s between 800 to 1500 feet off the ground making the most awesome manuevures that I haven&#39;t witnesses since November of 2007. The one closest to the ground appeared to be just a burning bolt of gold undulating/ cycling gold ripples downward. The second one closest to the bolt appeared as a wing doing spiral 8 patterns &amp; the highest was a whitish corona with the classic saucer shape inbedded and what I found unbelieveable was that this certain one looked exactly like the crafts, (crap)? I thought as such anyways - Ed Walthers was getting from his Gulf Breeze shots. Totally strange to even a glimpse of something resembling this because I never took his pics. seriously. I&#39;m in awe. My little sister buzzed me 20 mins. later freaking, Bro Beam - You were so right because I can see 3 of them right now &amp; I just left the OB area going east out the I-8. $200.00 more &amp; I get the gem i&#39;ve been saving for &amp; HOPING that an event like this wouldn&#39;t transpire UNTIL I got it. Total viewing time for objects 10-13 mins. &amp; approx. 12 mins. after the 3 flickered out, sure enough helicopter city ensues. Thats it folks. LOOK UP!<n>

The first was when I was 15 in New Jersey, and I will report that another time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, this more recent on was last year in 2008, occurring in Lee Vinning, CA, on Feb. 27th, around 6:00pm  as my wife and I were driving north on Hwy. 395.  I have to estimate the time because it was just starting to get a bit dark, and we were probably a bit north of Lee Vinning as well, but this is the general time and place.  I remember the date exactly because we were driving from Georgia to my son’s wedding on the 29th of Feb. in Fremont, CA. two days later.  Also, the reason I wanted to report it now is because I saw the exacted same thing a few nights ago on the History Channel’s program UFO Hunters.  They had a sighting around 3am around Needles, CA of a blue-green glowing rectangular craft streaking across the sky and coming down, which was later picked up by 4 military helicopters and taken away still glowing.  This occurred only three months later in May of 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was saying, my wife and I both saw this blue-green glowing rectangle streak across our field of view in front of us from West to East, or left to right, since we were heading north.  It took about 2 seconds, maybe only one actually to cross our field of view and it was gone.  I was amazed to have seen such a thing and do not believe it was a meteor because of the unusual color and rectangular shape.  Also, it appeared to be arching upward rather than down.  I guess we assumed it was a secret Air Force vehicle, being that Edwards and Area 51 were not that far from us.  But after the UFO Hunters story, I feel as though I would like to add my sighting to your files.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an artist, I did a quick drawing of our sighting in Photoshop and my wife just now confirmed that this is what she also saw that night last year.  I will attempt to attach the drawing to this report.<n>

Just a little darker than the cloud that it flew over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed my wife outside with our dog for her last potty break before we planned on going to bed.  She and the dog went out the back door, which faces east.  I followed and stopped at the edge of our back porch to light a cigarette, but before lighting it, I looked to the east, up into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw movement and noticed a triangle shaped craft at what I estimate to be 1500 to 2000’ in altitude about three seconds before it flew over a small cloud from south to north where it became invisible due to the color of the craft, and the thickness of the cloud.  As it moved north, I was able to see movement through thin spots in this cloud, but only two times.  The total time of this sighting did not last more than 5 or 6 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft was moving at about 200 to 250 mph.  I base this on the fact that C-17s from McCord AFB fly over my home every day of the week, usually with full flaps and gear down, doing touch and goes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know the speed of the C-17, but if for touch and goes with flaps and gear, I think they are traveling at about 200mph or a little less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very large fir tree sits on the block just to the east of me.

This beautiful orb was about the size of a baseball and looked like Venus or Saturn or Mars only much larger. I jumped out of my car to get a better view, and watched for a few moments. Suddenly the glowing orb made a quick jut to the left and then back to the right again, and stood there for a few more seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden another orb indentilcal to this one zipped into view right besides the first orb. I watched in astonishment as these magnificent amber colored star-like orbs rocked and moved in direct opposite distances from each other, like a dance. Then suddenly the orb that appeared after the first orb shot away into the night sky and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house to call my family to come outside to see this awesome sight, but when we all ran back outside, to my utter dissapointment, both orbs were gone! These glowing star-like orbs moved much faster then shooting stars and were much larger in size than any planet in the night sky!! Their movements were short and quick, and they could stand motionless for at least a minute at a time. Never in my enitre life have I seen anything like this! It was indeed something just like something out of this world.<n>

Saw craft over the hills to the East far off in the distance. Craft appeard to remain very stationary, or or times to drift very slowly upward and off toward the South. Saw three lights. 1 at the top and two at the bottom, forming a triangle. Light on the bottom right hand side appeared to flash mostly red while top light and bottom left light appeared to change color, remaining mostly amber.  All lights flashed or pulsed. Flashes appeared to change in duration of pulses and color of lights, so that lights appear two twinkle. Seemed sometimes to wink out entirely.  There is a mine in operation over there but this light appeared to be above the hillside rather than on top of it. Please note that we are just to the North of the Mt. Whipple Observatory. Update. 19:24 object is still out there. 19:33 just had my son come out and look at the object and her also saw it and saw it move. 19:41 moving directly up and toward the East imperceptibly slowly. 19:44. Still there but stopped watching. Note: Saw possible companion craft much higher in elevation and much farther away a bit to the North. This object looked like a star but flashed very brightly once in a great while very brightly like a flash bulb. Hard to know if this was a star or just what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These helicopters were travelling at around 100-120mph but slowly came to a complete stop and went another 200 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 seconds after this I noticed lots of small shapeless bright dots emerge from a cloud.  It looked very similar to the debris you get when rockets explode.  As more emerged from the cloud I realised it was not debris as they seemed to be &#39;falling&#39; in a series of different single file rows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they approached the helicopters they were only 1/2 mile away and I got a scale and I quessed that these objects were about 5 by 5 feet big and looked as though they were wrapped in aluminium foil.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they all completely got out the clouds they were all loosing altitude and travelling at about 80mph. I want to make it clear that the movements of the objects were very jurky which was very strange, as if they would fly 20 feet, then stop for a fraction of a second, a bit like watching a video which was not fully buffered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects approached the ground they got within 100 feet of the ground but then accelerated upwards at a 90 degree angle back into the clouds at a speed of 400mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both my inlaws witnessed this and so do two elderly women who stopped their car at the end of our street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes after this 1 helicopter left in a south easterly direction.10 minutes after this both remaining helicopters left steight south.  These two helicopters flew about 600 ft over some housing and US ARMY could clearly be seen on the side of the Helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I did notice about them which I thought was strange was that there seemed to be a lampshade like object hanging from the bottom of these helicopters which omitted a yellow light every 4-5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as a medical professional.

It moved slowly across the sky for what appeared to be a mile or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped moving horizontally but looked like it was moving up vertically.  Suddenly about 8 or 10 bright saucer-like objects appeared around the original ‘ship’.  They did not appear to exit the original object, rather they appeared around it.  The new objects moved about freely and effortlessly.  They even appeared to form geometric shapes (a trapezoid, a rectangle with 2 parallel lines of 3 saucers each, etc).  The bright shapes looked like fireflies circling the original object.  They disappeared as quickly as they appeared, flying for about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The original object kept moving upward, moving from side to side occasionally.  Once more and about 5 minutes after they had disappeared, the saucer like objects reappeared and did a similar dance as in the first episode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They disappeared much as they appeared-quickly and in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was witnessed by at least 5 of my coworkers.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I heard a squeaking noise outside and looked out the window.  There was a rectangular object hovering above the tallest tree in my neighbors house.  It was quite close &amp; pretty much I was frozen in my tracks.   I initially thought it was a helicopter (medivac type that is rectangular).   I opened up the back door quickly to get a closer look.   However, it was NOT stirring up any wind – especially being so close, and it didn’t sound like a helicopter at all.  It made a squeaking sound pretty much like a squeaky wheel.  It was hovering completely stable unlike a helicopter remaining perfectly still.  I tried calling my husband on the cell (it is what I grabbed first), but the call failed multiple times.  I retreated to my bedroom where I peeked thru the blinds of a darkened room.  I had closed the blinds at one point &amp; looked out again and it was gone.  I then saw &amp; heard a “obvious” helicopter roaming around with a search light.  The sound very unlike the first object I had seen, and also a different shape (smaller oval helicopter).  My only regret is I didn’t grab my camera or camcorder.  I was too much in shock &amp; too frightened to even make a move past the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was white in color. It appeared for  I&#39;d say 3 to 5 seconds it moved downward in the sky and then completely disappeared. There were no blinking lights it was one color only in a upside down V shape. The ends of the light/craft were hazy. There was no sound. The only other object I saw in the sky was a hellocopter whitch was far in the distance no where near where I saw the light/craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stand from this computer and desk, then walk to my home office door. I open the door, step out into the cold night.  I look up, and oh my God... maybe 300 ft DIRECTLY above my head is a triangular craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have such anxiety as I write this. The craft was maybe 150&#39; wide along edge. It clearly traveled forward along one point of the triangle.  All edges were rounded and smooth. NO SOUND.  The bottom of the craft was clearly visable to me.  It had 3 large domes at the corners of the triangle that were glowing a steady amber light.  In the center of the craft was a larger dome that had antenas and other fixtures, that extended down from it.  The longest, and most centered of the extentions had a smooth pulsing red strobe.  The craft had no distinct color other than a metalic dark grey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved at about 15 to 20 mph, slow and steady in a SouthWest direction.  The craft seemed to be surveling and mapping, this is just a hunch.  I live in flight paths of two major airports, DFW and Dallas Love Field.  I could not help but notice that there were NO airplanes in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The nite was clear and crisp with N/W wind gusts.  I had an unobstructed view of the whole event for approximatly one minute and a half.  For the first 15 to 20 seconds, I was struck dumb with awe not even blinking.  Take a picture I quickly thought.  As I rushed in my office, completely confused as to the logical whereabouts of my family camera, I rumaged through my shelves and grabbed a pair of binoculars.  I stood on my diving board, and at 17x mag. I watched it float off over distant house and treetops toward downtown Dallas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I am not crazy, although this event has tested every limit of my logical capacity.  I sat in true shock, shivering on my couch wearing my bathrobe trying to calm down for the first 15 minutes after.  I dont understand why I was allowed to witness it or them.  I did not roboticaly move on command or anything like that, however I was asked or encouraged to see.  I just dont know how else to explain that part of the experience.<n>

I turned to look and said to my father, who was right in front of me, “look at that.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment the light turned green and sped up to an incredible speed.  Right before it disappeared behind the house it turned bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we saw it moving across the sky it left streaks of the colors it changed in it’s wake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran outside to the spot where we thought it might have landed.  In the spot that it appeared to move to. We saw what could have been a star, but it was far below all of the other stars and it was blinking several colors. In no apparent order it would turn red, green, blue and white. We watched for approximately an hour and it would move slightly in random directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father is a fairly serious individual and would usually cast off such things. However upon seeing this he was thoroughly spooked as was I. Neither him nor I would normally be so intrigued by such a thing, but upon seeing this neither of us could stop looking. We most definitely saw something inhuman because the object was moving far faster than any human flying aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed a meteor, and then focussed on the star, Sirius.  Just a guess, given that our experience suggests that a genuine UFO probably would not hover in the sky for an hour.  PD))<n>

A bright orange light in the Southeast sky caught my attention.  It seemed pretty far away and moved very slowly.  There was no noise and no blinking lights as on an aircraft.  It seemed to move too slowly for an aircraft.  It gradually drifted Northward and after a couple minutes it changed course and moved toward the East as it dimmed.  It then faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I managed to get a pair of binoculars and it was simply a single orange light with a constant intensity and no other lights, blinking or otherwise.  No trail was left.  The sky was mostly clear with just a few cirrus clouds and no moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An almost identical light was seen a few years ago by myself that moved in a similar fashion, but in the opposite direction.  I had reported that sighting as well on this site.  I’m interested if anyone else saw this light or if there is some explanation for what I have seen, now twice.<n>

Also, they didn&#39;t make much noise. At first I thought they were choppers, but they were too silent for choppers. They seemed to be in a chopper shape though or airplane shape. The only other possibility is a government new-aircraft. I saw what was clearly a gvt plane fly after one of the things, but it was dark and I&#39;m unsure of all of this. I saw an at least regular airplane right after so I knew it wasn&#39;t one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

As it did so, smaller objects approached the area vacated by the object.  These smaller objects crossed paths in a head-on path at an extremely high rate of speed.

If it was a plane heading east it should have gained on me since i was heading west, but the object was just standing still..As i got closer i noticed a State Trooper sitting on the side of the east bound lanes with his overhead lights flashing, but he/she didnt have a car pulled over..It looked like he/she was there just observing the object as well...The object was about 4 to 5 hundred feet off the roadway and about 200 feet in the air. It was sort of bell shaped with one very bright light on the underside and other not so bright lights along the sides..I slowed down to about 45mph and got a good look at it for about 10-15 seconds...I heard no sound and it didnt look like anything i have ever seen before..I must admit my heart was racing...After returning home i called the police department in the town where i saw the object but was told there were no other reports...I know others must have seen this also because it was so bright and unusual that you couldnt help but notice it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was heading from west to the north-east, moving fairly slow and about at a height of maybe 40,000 FT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed it right away, in that it didn&#39;t have the same glow of a commercial or private plane.  Not to mention, the entire object was luminescent/glowing (it wasn&#39;t the headlight of an airplane, but just as bright).  Anyhow, as it began to head north, I started noticing small red glowing objects were being released from the craft.  These small objects would propel themselves and an incredible high rate, straight down, or in a 90 degree angle and then just disappear.  These red glowing objects were being released, every 5 seconds or so.  After 3 of these glowing-red objects were released, the craft then released 3 more objects, all at once, then begin to accelerate and incredible rate of speed.  As it was accelerating, it begin to lose it&#39;s orange glow and literally began to disappear! Before it disappeared, it seem to accelerate to over a 2 thousand miles an hour (from 200 MPH to 2000 MPH with in 2 or 3 seconds).  I watched this object for approximately 5 minutes (from start to finish).<n>

The event grew louder and louder as it approached our house and I jumped out of the Hot tub to see if there was an aircraft that was going to crash nearby. The only thing I could assume was that it was a jet airliner, but it was getting way to loud and way to close. The sound was also somehow wrong and a lower tone than a jumbo jet, and it sounded like an electrical transformer hum, but at a deeper and yet sharper tonality with a bit of a throb to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft flew nearly over our ranch and was nothing but a dark spot (or lack of cloud reflection) in the sky against the clouds. No lights at all. You could feel the strong humming in the air and my body was vibrating with the noise as it passed heading up towards the hills and on to Gunnison Colorado. Never heard or felt anything like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Several stars were visible but one stood out as it appeared to be a sphere rather that a twinkling object. I presumed it was a planet and that was more clearly visible due to being in open waters with the absence of light. I then became more intruiged with it as I realized it was positioned between my line of sight and the scattered cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner had I realized that, then the object began spinning in a pinwheel fashion, the circumference of the area growing with each revolution. It spun very fast and I can only speculate that it spun 8-12 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then sped off in a north-westerly direction at an amazing rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I find it difficult to characterize the sighting and the motion other than to compare it&#39;s actions with the child&#39;s game of &#34;crack the whip&#34;. The pinwheel motion almost looked like the object was gaining momentum and when it had enough, it &#34;flung&#34; itself into the northwestern sky. I followed it for approx 1-2 seconds before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot articulate properly the impact of witnessing this phenomenon. It was much more spectacular than my description provides.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/24/08 15:30|San Antonio|TX|Changing|5 minutes|Guitar Pick shaped UFO Flies Over Houses In San Antonio Subdivision|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61984.html|68|ndxe200802| Guitar Pick shaped UFO Flies Over Houses In San Antonio Subdivision<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife with brother and I were sitting outside on our patio deck when I noticed something I thought might have been a floating bag drifting over from the direction of our neighbors house toward us. I pointed it out to my wife and made a joking comment about it being a UFO as she is a serious skeptic on the subject. My brother and I started discussing how the object was at a high altitude for it being a plastic bag and discussed the physics behind the strength of the wind needed for it to stay aloft. As we  we discussing this, the object made a lazy L-shaped U-turn toward the house behind us. It was at this point that both my brother and my wife noticed that the object had a &#34;guitar-pick&#34; shape and was not a plastic bag. I also noticed that the object was rocking back and forth on its axis in a slow wobble. We stood motionless watching the object as it continued toward the street in front of the house behind ours. I would approximate its altitude at being between 50-100 feet from the ground. Its length was 3-5 feet and had almost no width that I could see, making it extremely flat. The objects color was very white with no lights or moving parts seen. It made no sound that we could hear. When it reached the next street behind our house it started to gain altitude steadily. We could not begin to guess the speed at which it rose but it must have been extremely fast because it reached a very high altitude in around 30 seconds. At some point before we lost sight of it in the sky, I noticed that there was a tiny white round object that had seemingly materialized from the sky and flew very close to the &#34;guitar-pick&#34;. I mentioned this to my brother who then stated that I must have been staring too long at the sky and was seeing a reflection of the light. I stood close to him and pointed the object out. He grew excited as he saw another white orb streak by the &#34;guitar-pick&#34;. My wife suddenly pointed out yet another one moving in the opposite direction the other 2 had taken. These white orbs were moving at speeds that were impossibly fast and seemed to orbit the &#34;guitar-pick&#34; in motion. The &#34;guitar-pick&#34; at this time was almost out of visual range but looked as if it was still gaining in altitude. There were no other aircraft in the sky that day. There are sometimes military aircraft in the vicinity but as it was a Sunday very few if any were flying. I served in a ADA (Air Defense Artillery)Army unit for 3 years and can readily identify many types of aircraft by sight and sound. I have never witnessed anything to the same likeness before and probably will never again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Out of no where a large sparkling ball (much like a single firework but unimaginably larger) fell down from the sky flying low and sucked it self back into the horizon in one swift motion. It couldn&#39;t have been a plane the ball was too sparkily and very large-- traveling about the speed of a shooting star. I thought it might have been a giant meteorite or a comet but judging by its mass, even if most of it had burned up in the atmosphere, It still would have made a large noticeable impact where it had landed, most likely enough to get media coverage. I haven&#39;t heard anything on the news however, which leaves me with a blank answer for what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I went to the bathroom and did not turn on any lights and looked out the bathroom window and saw a huge orange glow on the ground.  I first thought it was a bonfire or someone in our pasture.  The object was on the ground and I could see definition in the lights going around the object.  I studied the object for several minutes going back into my bedroom to see if maybe it was a glare from the TV or some other light in my house.  I turned off the TV and there were no other lights on in my house and went back to look and it was still there.  I then went into my dining room area an looked out that window and watched the object again.  I then called my 17 year old son to come look at this as well.  He watched the object with me in disbelief trying to figure out what the bright orange glow was.  We than went outside on the carport and it was very quiet and my dog was not barking at the object.  My son went in the front yard to look to see if it was the moon somehow glaring in the pasture but it was not.  I called for him to come in the house because I was actually beginning to get frightened at this point.  I do live near West Georgia Regional Airport and thought maybe it was some sort of aircraft.  We went into the house and within 10 seconds when we left the back yard and went back to the dining room area the object had disappeared.   I also could see a strange glow where the object had been.  My son and I both could see the definition of the lights on the center of the object and it was very bright.  I know what we saw was something out of this world and know that we cannot be the only life in the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I was about 15 mins from Florence, TX when I saw a large spacecraft fly over head. It was flying low to the ground about as high as a low billboard. It made no sound. From underneath it was like a clover shape with three petals. It had intricate red lights on its underbelly which is how i was able to see the actual shape at night. This was very close so there was no mistake about what it was. I have seen all kinds of planes and jets because i grew up in Hampton Roads which is home to a number of military bases. I know what planes look like and sound like but this was truely not from here. I called the police department to make a report and the officer was shocked when I pointed out the aircraft made no sound so I felt like he knew this was very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I flashed the bights of the car at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the red and green lights  came together as if to focus  on me?  Then  a second later they went back to the the 400ft  gap as before...it scared me so I went back down to the next house and watched them as it  move off to the west then disappeared from sight for a few mins.   There was  a single bigger white light that came up over the trees  increased slightly in brightness then disappeared.  I slept in a motel that nite, it was very weird..<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were many sighting around here in the 90s, so I&#39;ve heard.

Moonrise had not occurred yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon leaving our house (facing east towards Highway 176) to get in the car, I noticed red lights of fast moving aircraft moving roughly north.  Living within a few miles of airport – this was not unusual, but they were moving very fast and were fairly low (I would say 500-1000 ft.) above a residential area.  They made a fairly tight arcing turn left and back around over Crowfield Lake/swamp to a SSE trajectory and happened to come right over our street.  The fighters made a distinctive sound and I would guess they were F-16’s from Shaw AFB in Sumter.  Charleston AFB does not have fighters as permanent party residents.  The 4 fighters were all less than 2 plane widths apart – definitely not a typical formation over a densely populated area at night.  Now really interesting part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking that that was an unusual flight pattern for a Saturday night my wife and I got in the car and started driving to North Charleston.  Just as we were leaving our neighborhood we saw 3 unusual white lights about the height of a cell tower (200 ft or so) over the Goose Creek Reservoir Swamp (between Wannamaker Park and Goose Creek).  We saw the lights for about ten seconds, and then they were gone.  We drove back around the same way later, and were not able to see the same thing again, so it was not some errant streetlight.  So either it was a plane that crashed into the swamp or something else.  There were no blinking white or red lights, no anti-collision lights, just three very bright white lights (almost life bright streetlights) 200 feet over a place where there are no streets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is now 2152 as of this writing and a family member also claims to have seen a strangely flying white light from the Isle of Palms connector looking toward the big dipper.  Apparently this light was moving erratically (fast then slow then fast then slow again) for about 45 seconds.  Apparently then they disappeared - I will try to pick more details out later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First, I thought it was a shooting star, but then it kept going and I noticed there was no trail of any kind. About this time I saw the light wobble slightly and then continue its direct path to the east. I called to my wife who was standing close by and asked her if she new what that was as I pointed it out in the sky. Her mother who was also nearby came to look but the object was gone before she spotted anything. The light was small and bright at first, about the size and brightness of when I see Venus in the sky, then as it appeared to move fast to the east it began to fade and become reddish orange in color until it faded away completely. Then I noticed a jet airliner at a relatively high altitude and noticed that the light I had just seen was probably traveling about 3 to 4 times the speed and was probably at a much higher altitude. The whole event probably lasted 10-15 seconds and occurred around 7:00pm on February 23, 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object did not make any sound what so ever that I could tell. This thing was the biggest thing I have ever seen in the air, and it was probably several miles away. I noticed a small Cessna aircraft in the vicinity and the object dwarfed the aircraft. The Cessna aircraft look as big as a pinhead next to this object. The object then moved in a southerly direction and disappeared behind a building. I went around the building to maintain my view and the object seemed to have just disappeared. There were several other people out walking and saw this object as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were in the middle of a game and I happened to look up into the sky. I noticed a bright green light, it resembled a falling star. It was traveling very fast in towards the ground. It only lasted about 3 seconds then it turned to flames and immediately dissapeared. Less than a minute later, three jets which looked to me like military fighter jets, came up from about where the light had been and branched in three directions. One went straight, one went to the right and the other to left. I never saw the planes again. 4 other players along with myself witnessed all of the above. I&#39;m not sure if any spectators noticed what was going on. I&#39;m not sure if it was a UFO or just an honest trick of the eye. None the less, it was strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At approximately 1:45 AM, I was desparately trying to get our dog to come back in the house after having just let her out 5 - 10 minutes or so prior to the event.  The reason for trying to get our dog back in the house so quickly - was that she had started to bark at something and I didn&#39;t want her barking to disturb our neighbors. So, I went out into our back yard and found our dog just sitting in the snow in the middle of our yard barking at something up in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it might be a squirrel, rabbit, or raccoon - which we have seen in our neighborhood on more than once occassion - so I scanned our one main tree in our backyard for sign of one of these animals but didn&#39;t see anything despite our dog still barking.  It was then that a huge football-sh! aped object appeared out of nowhere in the southwest sky.  The object was more rounded on the ends (as opposed to coming to a point like a football), and was completely on fire.. it was a large flaming object that suddenly appeared, remained motionless for 10 seconds or so, and then rocketed off in a southwest direction at a speed that was - I would say - impossible.  It left the entire observable night sky area in under 1 second.  It went from (seemingly) standing still, to being gone in under a second.  The object did not have any lights or sound.<n>

We saw this retangular flat object that was levitating in the sky. It was not that high up. At first we thought it was a balloon or a bird. As we looked closer we all saw that the object was in deed a flat retangular shape with a luminous circle around it.  It kept swaying back and forth in an upward motion.  At first it was hovering over the same spot but then it continued to get higher. This went on for about two to three minutes and it disappeared. We actually could not believe what we were seeing. I typically do not believe in this type of stuff but there is NO other explanantion for this object. The fact that it was dark outside and we could see this black object floating in the air, leeds me to believe that this was something of a different nature. I do not know if this was indeed a UFO, but it was not normal whatever it was.  Please, I am not crazy. There were 3 of us, completely sober, who all witness the same exact object and motions. I did try to take a picture of the object. Only if you hold the carmera a certain way can you see the &#34;glow&#34; of the object.  It was a white circle around it. My flash on the camera would not work so I guess the black object did not come through. I just really want some type of explaination as to what this was? Have others reported this type of object before? I am freaked out right now.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was and other cars decending the fwy a (felt hat shaped) circular black silhouette of a craft was seen right in the middle of the moon, it was a beautiful view as it was very clearly outlined, the UFO silhouette was black in front of the moon.  It had no blinking lights on it (that is why it didn&#39;t look like a plane or a helicopter) it was not blinkin on side wings on sides nor bottom nor front nor roof and was totally black against the backdrop of the moon.  It stayed in front of the moon about 3 seconds then took off so fast it disapeared in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was only for a brief moment, but I saw a bright green fireball, about the same size as the moon looks from Earth, fly past me from the south going north. After about half of a second it just disappeared. The best way I can describe the object was like the glow of a firework on its ascent before exploding. What was really strange was that the object had no trail of exhaust or smoke. It was also completely silent, or at least quiet enough so that I couldn’t hear it over the sound of road noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

There was a big white ball, very bright. There was what looked like flares of fire coming out of it. The object was smaller than the moon, but bigger than a planet. I don’t really know how to describe the size. It lit up the whole sky. There was a very slight flashing to the light. I called my friend (who lives about 10 minutes away) and began telling him about it. About 30 seconds into the call, the UFO disappeared. At that moment, my friend’s lights flickered and all his electronics stopped working. However, everything in my house was fine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light did not slow down nor did it zig zag  it went exactly west to east .It was witnessed by me my wife and friends. The plane was north of us at the time we saw the light in the west major distance apart from one another.

Suddenly; I looked up and saw a triangle craft; that was not really pointed tips, but rather round tips of the craft.  I noticed it for about a couple of minutes; and it moved a bit to the north of the horizon, and it hovered over an area for a few more minutes and suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed no sounds and it was almost see through triangle craft, it also had one red light on the tail but it was like in the middle of the end of the craft, so it was not an air plane or a helicopter. It blended well into the dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept a close eye on it for a couple of minutes; no one else seemed to notice it but me.  So; I didn’t have any witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work at a grocery store; here in Murrieta, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if this is a new military craft; or is it an actual alien craft?<n>

The snow is pretty deep and I was facing the woods. I see a sphere of light floating about 6 feet off the ground, about 32 yards away floating smoothly east to west without bobbing and in a straight line. It was silent. I could clearly see there was no person there, only this golden light. If someone was there with a light I would&#39;ve seen him or her that close in the bright snow. There was no traffic or reflection, it was glowing a golden color and a little smaller than a basketball size. It was a little bright than a truck headlight. It moved faster than a person could walk. I walked to the exact spot where it was and there was no tracks at all in the snow. There was a very strong odor in the air, like a natural gas well was left uncapped, but the nearest gas well was capped and buried years ago and I never smelled a gas odor since it was capped. We don&#39;t have any natural gas for heat, only electric. It was so strong I lost my breath and had to go back inside quickly. The dogs had no reaction whatsoever, they did their business and came back in without barking. The next day the gas odor was gone and there still were no tracks in the snow where I saw the light. The woods are too dense in that area for a person to walk through so only rabbits and birds can go through it. This the 2nd such incident in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving at a high rate of speed its direction of travel was east to west it seemed to move effortlessly. But its movements were very jerky. There was an eerie humming noise it was a very low tone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered in one spot for a few seconds then jerked diagonally up ward to the right and stopped and hovered for a couple seconds, spinning the entire time.  Then it jerked diagonally down to the right were it stopped and hovered. Then it dropped just a little in its altitude before accelerating at an amazing speed and disappearing almost immediately after this acceleration began, not even a second after it was gone. Even though it was dark outside you could see where the disk disturbed the air it was just in and you could see the path it traveled for about 10 seconds after the craft was totally gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object left a very minimal trail of sparks behind it as it dropped.  Its size was like a nickel held at arms length away from the body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my location in Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota, it was dropping at a 10 degree angle going from east to west.  It disappeared into the trees approximately 10 degrees above the horizon.  At the point it disappeared into the horizon the object was 15 degrees East of South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned this occurrence to an acquaintance who lives in Grand Rapids, Minnesota the next day and he and his wife observed the same event. They observed  the same color object which was falling straight down to earth on a line from Grand Rapids to Ironwood, Michigan,  and disappearing into the trees before hitting the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could this have been a piece of the satellite that was shot down a day earlier?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally credible witness.

She stated that the object was round and had a red light circling the object and a had a red light located underneath the object blinking off and on. She stated that they had watched the object stay in a stationary position in the sky for approximately 30 minutes. We discussed the various possibilities, including a helicopter, airplane, balloon, etc. All these possible explanations were rejected by my daughter and her husband. The object was about the height of an airplane coming in for a landing. The possibility of a balloon was rejected because the object started moving in a northerly direction (against the wind) and then moved back into the original position. She asked if I could see the object and when I looked out my window, there it was! I watched it also and we continued to speculate about it. It then started moving North again and then disappeared. We were wondering if anyone else in Oklahoma City saw this object and reported it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, possibly?  PD))<n>

We slowed down to look and they went off. We continued to watch in that direction and they appeared again and pulsated on and off, they had a soft gold glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed a jet flying fast from a nearby air base, directly to where the lights had been. The jet then continued to circle the area before he flew off. We then turned North on another state road to try and see more. Sure enough the two sets of three lights came on again in a different area in the night sky. Again the jet came flying in and the lights went off. We set out in the country for another 30 minutes hoping for another sighting and saw just one set of lights,they pulseatedand then went off and that was it.Although we stayed out in the country for awhile we finally gave up reluctantly and went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened on Feb. 21, 2008 at 8:06 p.m.<n>

The cloud was no higher than a thousand feet.  The egg shaped object descended about 200 feet.  It than continued at the speed of my car ahead of mee and seemed to be deliberately observing me. Ite than ascended back and seemed to dock back into the cloud. The cloud than ascended away in a north westerly direction.  Banking sideway, which showed me the shapre of the cloud.  This object was on a UFO Program on the four different alien groups visiting us. It is the one with the egg shaped vehicle descending from a larger one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked where he was pointing, the sky was very clear there were a lot of clouds as we were having rain showers that day, which made the sky very clear and free of dust and pollutants.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw, at first glance, I and my coworker thought to be a weather balloon moving from east by south east towards north by north west in a straight line, moving at a high rate of speed. However, I quickly realized it was moving against the prevailing winds which were pushing the clouds in a northeasterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I believe to be small about the size of a midsized compact car. The object appeared to have a shape similar to a light bulb. The front was round and it tapered to a small almost pointed tail. The object was brightly polished gold metallic in color as the front bulbous area reflected the sun as it moved away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was well above the clouds, its speed did not vary, and the object did not tumble or roll or vary its direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are just about one mile from the San Jose International Air Port. The jet planes that were crossing over at this time were moving much slower than the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not leave a trail behind it, neither was there a flame coming out its tail end, it did not have wings, and it did not have a tail that would control its movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object was moving directly over us its bottoms color seemed to very in intensity like waves in a darker shade that moved from the front to the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time we started to observe the object the object remained in sight for about 40 to 45 seconds.<n>

High speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving home I saw 5 lights in a line floating below the tree line so i stopped at a stop sign for about 2 mins and put my windows/sun roof down and turned radio off to listen for it. There were no other cars around and it suddenly flew directly over my car about 50 feet off the ground.  I saw through my sunroof that it was a perfect square with 5 white lights and a red light.  I then sped home to tell my two friends about it and within 5 minutes we retraced my route to find it. About 2 miles away from my house the three of us spotted it about 3 miles away infront of us.  We continued to follow as best as we could so that we were less than a quarter mile behind it.  It was flying parallel to the road we were on and it suddenly took a 90 degree turn left at a very high speed and continued in that direction.  We tried to follow it with the accessible roads and finally lost it while we were on a back heavily wooded road about 6 or 7 miles from my house.  We then turned around to go home when we spotted it about 200 yards to our left off the road.  Going about 40 mph it followed our path and suddenly turned completely upright so that the 5 white lights were in a vertical line.  It appeared to be speeding towards our car behind us when, as it was speeding it seemed to be diving down and back up.  After pulling over we lost the craft in the woods so we drove slowly home and did not see it again.  When the craft first flew over me when i was alone it made no sounds at all and was shaped like a perfect square.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Again,  it was cloudy and very cold.  Ice on trees, grass, etc. 2 amber lights appeared to be flashing and jumping around in SW sky. They would go out and a couple of white lights would appear and then go out. Red &#34;stuff&#34; came out of one amber light and fell towards the ground.  Took pictures on digital camera and camcorder....nothing showed up on either film.  Lasted from 7pm to midnight. Speculation is that the lights are reflections off of iced covered tree tops.  Lights on Feb. 11 were really close and then lingered further off to the SW.  These lights last night didn&#39;t get out of their original area of observation. The power lines close to our house were sizzling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

From this view it was shiny and light in color, but opaque like glow-in- the-dark material that is not glowing.  It then veered to the left and flew back up vertically, seeming to be sucked into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, a small monoplane flew by in the area traveling east. Then a commercial jet flew nearby traveling northwest.  This gave me scale and relative perspective to the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the craft disappeared, it was as if it was fleeing from sight of the two planes that would soon come into view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked to the car next to me and noticed a man in a BMW also looking up at the area in the sky talking on a cell phone.  It appeared that other drivers were looking up as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptionally credible witness.  PD))<n>

McCord Air Force base and Fort Lewis Army base are very near by.  Thun Field, a small plane airport, is within 2 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While typing an e-mail, I heard the 11 o&#39;clock P.M. weather man remind us to go look at the stunning lunar eclipse.  I went out to the back porch to gaze at the moon, which was about half shadowed in its eclipse.  The night was clear and the moon was over the North/East section of my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed the binoculars off the workbench to get a better view.  As I raised them to my eyes and focused on the moon, I saw a shadow cross my view.  I pulled them away from my eyes thinking an owl must have flown by, since I heard no sound of a plane.  Nothing seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put the binoculars back to my eyes and floating in front of the moon was a giant V shaped object.  Not as sharp as a V but not as curved as a boomerang.  It was slowly moving, more like floating toward the small Thun airfield to the north.  It was barely above the 75 foot evergreen trees on the west and north sides of my 1/4 acre and was directly over my house and barely moving.  The thing was giant.  I would guess 3 football field lengths per wing.  No body, no windows, no vapor trail, no noise at all.  Just a giant V with the faintest of white night lights all along the top of the V, in a straight line.  It was almost see through and nearly invisible to the naked eye.  I had to scan back and forth to see the whole thing until it got farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Transfixed I just stood there and watched. Several times I pulled the binoculars away and could only barely see it. I thought about getting the flashlight and flashing it at it but stood there and watched it float away towards the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just found this website on 10/13/09 and saw the Feb. 20th, 2008, account of a sighting in Fayetteville, North Carolina about the same time.  Never knew there was a place to report to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I need to get better binoculars!<n>

Left and lower than the moon. I noticed that it was not moving and did not look like a plane. I got out my binoculars for a better look. I was fascinated, so, I had my former husband look at this and his daughter. They saw it more clearly than I did.  At his first glance he said that, it looked like a satellite. I asked him to take a closer look with the binoculars. All of us looked at it through them. Out consensus was that it looked most like a saucer. They also thought that it look&#39;s like Saturn with the ring around it. All I could see was an extra light. I just checked the sky it is still there. I will probably watch it for a long time tonight if it stay&#39;s. It still has not moved. I tried to make a call to you, however, there is no toll free number for you. We have thought of calling the police. I don&#39;t quite know what to do to insure that other&#39;s see this right now that have not yet. Therefore, I may risk being thought of as a nut and call the local police anyway. It seems a small thing to have happen if other&#39;s may witness this. I have always wanted to see one. I hope that this is the real thing. I also hope that somehow I will discover if other&#39;s have seen it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have just called two friends to go and look at it too. It was suggested to me that I call our local new&#39;. I&#39;ll be calling chanel 8. Good luck with this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From my position in North Carolina, the moon was in full lunar eclipse; weather was ideal- &#34;clear blue and 22&#34; as we say in aviation; the moon was approximately 55 degrees South/ Southwest overhead- in other words, I had a clear unobstructed view of the lunar eclipse from my position on my front porch in Fayetteville, NC. I normally wouldn&#39;t be looking at the moon except this Lunar Eclipse event had been widely publicized on TV that evening. I was enjoying an event with unobstructed view that few will ever witness in their life time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10 minutes into the full lunar eclipse, about 22:40 EST, I noticed on the left side of the moon (as I was facing it), a very bright, round object resembling a satellite; a bright pin-point of light object; clearly not a naturally formed object appeared suddenly, traveling in a straight line from the left side of the back side of the moon- it was clearly traveling in a straight line towards Earth. In about one to two seconds, the object made a 90 degree turn to my right, directly in front of the face of the fully eclipsed moon.  As quick as it appeared and shot across in front of my unobstructed view of the eclipsed moon, it disappeared off to my right side of the Moon and became invisible almost immediately of passing out of the Umbra shadow of the Earth eclipse of the Moon.  The entire event was less than 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a US Army trained combat helicopter pilot, Desert Storm veteran of the Gulf War.  I&#39;m accustomed and trained to look for things, especially at night.  This was not a naturally occurring object. This object made intelligent turns and in relation to the position of the moon, was traveling at as fantastic rate of speed. I am not a UFO nut.  You may even call me skeptical.  I have been able to observe a great deal of objects while flying with night vision goggles at night in various parts of the world.  I have witnessed many naturally occurring and man-made events in the sky normally not seen with the naked eye.  But this object appeared from the back-side of the moon with my un-aided view and flew directly across in front of the moon was of intelligent design and flight path.  It probably would not have been visible during the lighted or visible, not eclipsed, moon, by an un-aided human eye.  But during the eclipsed darkened view of the Moon, it was so clearly visible to the naked human eye!   I truly believe the object I observed was not of natural origin but of intelligent origin.  I am capable of distinguishing the difference between a circular type orbit versus a straight flight path.  This object was of the latter. And I know of no known human-made objects that could have produced such incredible speeds and turns based upon its observed position that night from the back side of the moon, making an instant 90 degree right turn in front and across the eclipsed moon that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, I was 47 years old at the time of the lunar eclipse and my eye sight has been evaluated as 20/12 &amp; 20/15 in each eye during every one of my US Army Flight Physical Evaluations for the past 20 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly believe I witnessed an intelligently driven object not of man-made origin.  I have reluctantly not reported this event to anyone before now because it was so incredible to believe myself.  And I do not want to be labeled a &#34;UFO Nut&#34;.  But I witnessed, regardless of scrutiny, a truly incredible event that evening on 20 February 2008 during the Lunar Eclipse.<n>

All were perfectly aligned and distanced. Reviewing the enlarged image, the red spheres appear to have 2 red objects or lights attached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2-white spheres bypassed the other spheres, taking the lead.  All spheres and flight paths were captured in the image.  Photo frames 2388 and 2390 did not contain the spheres which means they had to appear/disappear within 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since on the Eastern U.S. at 22:35, the spheres unlikely to have been related to the Pacific shooting down of the spy satellite -- spheres traveling in opposite  direction -- satellite was shot down at 22:30 Pacific time, not Eastern. Only one missile used -- 6 spheres shown.  One speculation it could be satellite remnants re-entering atmosphere but unlikely due to the exact alignment, precision of distance between objects, and mere number of objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other possibility would be meteors but precisioning of objects and containing white as well as red spheres may rule that out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cannot be stars since there are no formations of that type below the moon.  In addition, they do not appear before or after frame 2389.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 10:01 Eastern Time (as the eclipse was becoming total) an object came into view from overhead.  My attention had been on the Moon, so I didn&#39;t see it coming until it was noticeably passing just to the South of the Moon.  There had been no loud &#34;jet plane&#34; sound to signal it&#39;s appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was without a doubt the brightest object in the sky.  It was a brilliant golden color and had a &#34;flutter&#34; or wobble as it moved.  There were occasional flashes of red or white that I couldn&#39;t tell whether they were onboard lights or reflections because of the wobble.  Within a few seconds it had disappeared over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved pretty well due East at a pretty good clip.  Within a minute, I could hear that a plane (jet?) was coming.  It followed the same basic path as the first object.  It&#39;s running lights were nowhere near as bright as the object before it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It may have just been a coincidence, but it seemed that it was following the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Shortly after 2200, I saw an object that was round to oval in shape I am unsure if it was tilted if at all. It was not emitting any light at first but a faint reflection of light pollution making its shape apparent. I was facing east; it passed by at about 20-30 degrees above the horizon moving from south to north. I noticed it first coming into sight from the right behind a few trees. It was in plane sight for approximately 90-120 degrees, for 5- 10 seconds.  For the last 3 seconds of my observation, it was emitting a neon-blue light. There was no apparent source of the light, meaning no visible bulb or bulbs, it looked like it was projected off of the surface or the surface itself was emitting the light in sporadic pulse. Only parts of it were making light, not the whole object, it was not in unison or uniform. It was like an imitation of lightening or the reaction to some form of stimulation, comparable to bio-lumination. It stopped making the blue light just before it fell out of sight behind more trees. It did not slow, stop, accelerate, or alter course for the duration of my observation.   I am within 5 miles of a municipal airport, and within 10 miles of a naval station, that holds near constant helicopter operations, this was not a helicopter, I have military training in identifying and reporting surface and air “contacts” and identifying standard light configurations, I am very familiar with the helicopters I used to observe in the military and watch fly over the house every day and all hours of the night. It did not make a sound. I can only speculate the altitude of the object; it was low enough to reflect a very faint and dull light from urban lumination for the duration of my observation.<n>

I was outdoors watching the lunar eclipse come to its climax.  After the moon was completely eclipsed, I took a few minutes to myself to think how beautiful a thing it really was.  I was taking pictures but failing in my attempts.  My digital camera kept stalling on me, shutting down and then restarting again.  It was a mere 9 degrees Fahrenheit outside and I had been outdoors for about 20 minutes.  I began to wonder if the cold was making the camera malfunction or if something more scientific as the eclipse was causing this mishap. I began to think to myself how I should start heading indoors (since the eclipse had occurred) but something compelled me to stay a bit longer and linger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There I stood in my backyard suddenly looking about the sky and watching all the planes take flight.  It was a busy travel night I gathered since I had seen at least 7 aircrafts flying about the sky (I live roughly15 miles from a major airport).  I watched how graceful they appeared and then noticed the stars out (which is rare being so close to city lights, pollution etc.)  Soon there was nothing moving about for me to look at. All was quiet in the night sky.  I took one more glance to the eclipsed moon and looked down to the ground, being careful to not step on ice and fall.  Something caught my attention to look up one last time-straight up-.  It’s hard to describe what made me look and what even I really saw for it occurred very fast and was nothing I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this silhouette or shadow type blob appear out of the thin sky, grey in color, almost invisible. Around it was the brightest light I’ve ever seen.  If it wasn’t for this bright white light, I would not ever of made out the silhouette in the first place.  The light streaked across the sky, so quick and so straight I just froze and stared up trying to follow with my eyes where it could have gone.  The streak was thick (diameter but not length) and left no remnants….it simply vanished as quickly as it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I frantically searched the sky and started to walk around searching for where this light could have possibly gone. I could not explain it, I was dumbfounded.  There was no cloud in the sky for this light or object to disappear in to and the speed of this light was unreal!!  I was stunned as to what just happened.  My first reasoning was a falling star.  Witnessing many falling stars over the years I compared and contrasted the facts and visuals and knew in my heart there was no way that was a falling star.  The flight pattern of the light, the diameter of the light, the sheer brightness and speed was unexplainable.  Plus, the grayish image I saw split seconds to the light illuminating around and or hovering near it was also unexplainable. My second line of reasoning was a plane (since I had seen so many out).  I laughed at myself when my brain tried to suggest that one.  Planes do not hover, come out of nowhere and jet to nowhere.  I have yet to see a plane travel at the speed I saw this light move.  Plus, the fact how this all occurred in less then 4 seconds.  I’ve re enacted this event in my minds eye and when I do I get this sense of awe and estrangement.  My brain just can’t wrap around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object appeared  to be a triangle shape kinda transparent moving slowly fluid like in a south and slightly westward direction . It appeared to be low the size of 20 to 30 feet across and 15 feet to the point with about 15 soft red lights along the back, the lights did not blink but moved or softly waved with the entire craft kinda fluid like, similar to a  a jelly fish&#39;s appearance and movement (not shape). We had the opportunity to witness this with binoculars as well as unaided sight it is hard to say the size but we lost sight of it as it went over the neighbors house .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had almost forgotten about it so when I started taking pictures the earths shadow had already covered most of the moon. This was around 7:35 my first few shots were handheld but I decided that the tripod would be a good idea. I took many pictures tracking the moon as it moved to the right across the sky. I stopped taking pictures around 20:10 because clouds were starting to move in. I never saw anything out of the ordinary while I was taking the pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I downloaded the images I noticed a rainbow colored object in the lower left hand corner. Out of the 34 pictures I took it’s in almost every one. Even the shot where I made the mistake of using a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m sure it’s not a light refraction. There is clearly a saucer shaped object with a full spectrum of colored lights wrapped around it. You can clearly see that the colored light wraps around the object. You can see how the light glows out into space kind of like a flashlight beam. My only guess as to why I didn’t see it is that the light must pulse at a rate that makes the object invisible to the naked eye. Kind of like when you take a picture of an older TV &amp; see line in the picture that you can’t see when you’re actually watching the TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness describes himself as an experienced photographer.

The eclipse was hard to see with some clouds interrupting the view, and so we were gazing about at the stars looking for satellites to watch.  We saw several satellites and shooting stars.  Sometime during the eclipse, I’m pretty sure it was past the halfway point, someone noticed something and said, &#34;They look at that!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at approximately 10:00 in the sky, above the height of the moon, but southeast of it.  I saw what appeared at first to be a bright star, a point of bright light.  At first I thought it was a star, then it grew larger and brighter then all the other stars in the sky.  Although it was growing larger, it remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next thought was that it was a helicopter, with it&#39;s spotlight on, pointing at, and coming directly towards us.  It made no sound as it grew brighter, then it appeared to turn away and head south.  As it turned, it dimmed considerably.  This I would expect from a searchlight beacon.  Then it dimmed more, until it was no brighter than a star, and no larger.  As it continued moving south it’s path became erratic, the way a star looks through a telescope as you’re trying to center on it.  It moved up and down, in a jerky motion.  It continued this way, worming it’s way through the backdrop of stars until finally it was too dim to see.  The whole sighting event lasted about three minutes. The bright spotlight effect lasted about 20 seconds before the turn or the dimming, whatever it was, happened.<n>

I went by the tent to look at the stars and saw this strange light.  It stood out at first because it was the brightest, far brighter then any star or planet.  It was also changing colors, blue, red, yellow, green.  Every color that you can imagine.  Not only was it changing color, but it was moving around.  Like a hovering insect. It was not moving fast, but was swaying slowly, around in circles and up and down. It was also flashing and &#34;pulsing&#34;. It stayed around for about an hour, and then it was gone. This last part might have been my imagination, but it seemed to be shooting &#34;light beams&#34;, or maybe a sort of &#34;extra large&#34; search light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ps-- This happened during a total eclipes of the moon in the South East part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was looking out my window facing east and a object appeared about 15 feet above the trees and was flat on the front, and long, longer than my house.  I could distinctly see an outline but there were no lights or sound. about 1 foot inside and under the edges, were many birds. These birds were white and flying into each other and in no kind of formation, almost like they were confused.  I saw many other birds all around, but the other birds were flying in a &#34;V&#34;.  The object was moving about 35 to 40 m.p.h. heading west about a mile south of I-70 headed directly for downtown Kansas City. I yelled at my wife after about 15 seconds of looking directly at it and she came into the bedroom and looked and saw the end of the object.  She explains that when she saw it, it was like a perfectly straight object, almost like a giant ruler.  I am convinced that what I saw was genuine, and to the best of my ability, true.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a nice night, a bit windy and cool with a full moon with increasing cloud cover.  From the balcony on the fifth floor room, I observed as the clouds began to obscure the moon a orange spherical light appeared from the cloud cover drifting against the wind to the east.  A second one appeared as the first one blinked out. The second one stayed in place and faded out.  Another light appeared still drifting to the east and blinked out.  Finally three lights blinked on simulatneously in a staggered line formation and a fourth one appeared to the left of the formation before &#34;zooming&#34; into line with the others. The formation tightened up and I left the balcony to get my wife outside to see this. When we both came back out, there were no lights. We waited for 15 minutes but nothing else appeared.<n>

We drove to a place near Edgar Hodges road southwest of Claxton, Ga. The object at first appeared to be atationary for the first ten minutes or so as we watched. I looked at the craft through a rifle scope and binoculars.  The craft itself appeared to be of a gray color.  It quartered away to our left.  It&#39;s shape was odd in that it was triangular with what was visible with bowed sweept wings from its center.  Although it was less than a mile to the object at a guess from us.  Totally silent.  The flashing low level lights made the rear of the craft appear rounded. The flashing white lights were just around the uderedge of its wings.  You couldn&#39;t quite see anything but the light itself and the little of the craft that was visible in this light.  It looked like the light was a by product of its propulsion.  It didn&#39;t much look like it should be flying at all with the trailing edges of its wings being so rounded.  The flashing intensified when the claft started to move away from us. A light at the end of each wing just around the edge of it.  A center light that had this same peculiar appearance of being just around the edge of the craft.  There were probly three or four smaller flashings between the center and each wing tip.  These also just appeared to be around the edge of this wing.  The intensity as well as the time cycle of this flashing also inceased as the craft moved silenty away to the west, I think, from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The sky was perfectly clear and there weren’t any clouds in sight.  The con-trails were different in size and makeup.  The large ones were not dissipating into the air and were left in a grid pattern from north to south and east to west.  I could tell the difference because the usual con-trails were smaller in size and dissipating into the air almost immediately after they were exhausted from the engines.  Then there was a distinct X that was made by these planes.  Suddenly out of no where there were these two oval shaped objects that were floating across the sky where the X was, not leaning behind and con-trails.  They were spaced apart and traveling east on the same trajectory.  I couldn’t see any wings and I thought it was just that they were too far away to tell but then a third plane came up behind them.  This plane had the con-trails and I could distinctly see the wings.  It was traveling in the same line behind the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the FAA and demanded answers to what was in our airspace and the operations manager put me on hold for about 20 minutes and then reported to me that the planes were an Air force training operation out of Reese AFB in Lubbock TX.  They were T-38 training planes.  Well, my father is an x-fighter pilot and retired commercial pilot and I know what T-38’s look like and it wasn’t them.  So I researched Reese AFB and it has been shut down since 1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Contrails??  PD))<n>

I was inside standing by the kerosene heater, and I was thinking about yesterday.  I heard geese squawking outside so looked up to look out the window toward the lake.  The geese were flying just shy of the surface of the lake; but they weren’t what caught my eye.  The waves were surprisingly rough because of the wind, and hovering above the waves were two blue lights.  One light on the right was slightly higher than the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights were separated by at least a foot.  I couldn’t take my eyes off them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to the sliding glass door and pressed myself up against the glass to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating.  I yelled at my mom for her to look.  She ignored me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They hovered slowly forward, and then, suddenly the lights as if reacting to something, dropped and broke the surface of the water.  It went under.  I slipped on my shoes and ran outside.  I watched the surface of the lake for at least a half hour.  The lights didn’t resurface.  I’m still waiting for it to come back up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, it was small, and the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.<n>

I was West Bound on I-90 in the vicinity of Mile Marker 232.  I saw a very bright flash of light in my drivers door window.  I turned my head  and observed one large yellow light with two smaller lights.  One of the smaller lights appeared to be blue and the other a coppery bronze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no observable lateral motion.  All observable motions was either downward (which was my best guess) or directly away from me.  I lost view of them without seeing impact either because they burned out or impacted below a small line of hills south of the Interstate in this area.  The area of observation was dark as the moon was on the opposite side of my car in its setting phase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flash of light in my drivers door window surprised me and I immediately turned my head for fear something was coming through the median at me.  It was high enough that I never saw in in my rear view mirror.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired AF flight crew member.  I recognize that lateral displacement would indicate movement parallel with me and the lack of lateral movement would indicate movement directly towards me or away from me or straight down (which was my impression).  In other words, I have been shot at and knew that if the light was steady on my canopy, I needed to move to get displacement.<n>

Could be distant radio towers, but some things don&#39;t fit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of February 18, 2008, my spouse and I were driving south on Highway 285 from IH-40.  About half-way between Vaughn and Roswell, I saw a group of red lights on the horizon towards the east/southeast (driver’s side of the car).  The lights were very low on the horizon--from my perspective they were at or near the ground.  There were at least a dozen red lights spread out over several hundred yards (from my perspective) and pulsing/blinking on and off at the same rate and at the same time.  They looked just like pulsing radio tower lights, except they were so low to the ground.  The lights were not moving.  The lights were somewhat dim (my husband couldn’t see them at all), and were not always visible since the terrain was slightly hilly.  Eventually, as we continued south, the lights moved fully toward the east, then east/northeast, then out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction was that it was a nearby airfield, but blinking red lights would not typically be used on a runway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at area maps, there is very little in the area.  We were already well south of Clovis/Cannon AFB, headed south, and the lights I saw were towards the east/southeast.  Also, since the lights were generally towards the east, I don’t believe it was the Roswell airport either.  Those lights didn’t come into view until much later, and were directly in front of us (due south).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most logical explanation is that this was a large group of radio or cellphone tower lights far in the distance -- perhaps as far as the NM/TX border -- that appeared from my perspective to be near the horizon. (We were using XM at the time, so I don’t know if there was an actual radio signal transmitting.)  The only thing that doesn&#39;t fit this explanation is that most radio tower groups I&#39;ve seen have lights pulsing at different times, and these lights all pulsed simultaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Primarily, I’m curious if anyone in the area has seen something similar, and/or if someone knows of a feature in the area that fits with what I saw.<n>

I thought it was a small airplane with its landing light on. I would estimate it was 1000-2000 feet in the air and the light was bright orange like that of a city street light. I thought the color was a bit odd for an airplane and I watched it come closer listening for the sound of its engine. I did not hear any sound and it seemed to gain a little altitude. It then slowed to a stop almost overhead and then I thought this can’t be a normal aircraft. I watched it not wanting to miss anything that it might do but I also wanted to film it. I ran to the house to get my video camera and filmed it from our deck. About that time it started to head due south and was the size of a large star. It continued until it faded out over the town of Aurora, WI. I managed to get the object on film but it is VERY shaky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was walking southbound on 78th Ave Se in the 2200 block of Mercer Island, the sky was exceptionally clear and I paused to observe the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking South-Southeast I saw a point of light that was moving.  The object was about the height of the moon at the time, in the area between the moon and my judgment of due south.  I my judgment of direction was based off the street (I assume the street is pointing due south, the street grid is pretty uniform)  The object’s size, intensity, and color were similar to that of the adjacent stars. Initially I thought it was a shooting star or satellite however the object separated into three distinct points of light. The 3 individual points had equivalent luminosity and size, in addition it should be noted that these “subunits” were equivalent to the single point I saw initially.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These three points seemed to stop in their trajectory, and organized themselves into a trigonal conformation.  The three objects then moved briefly south and then in formation westward, the three points changed their conformation as they moved; I noticed a few different distinct patterns in their movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)	Initially the three point’s seemed to change their speed relative to each-other so that each point cycled through being the leading vertex of the triangle. I would describe their formation as a triangle rolling across the sky. (This conformation was observed as the object(s) moved south to a lower position relative to the horizon, and again as they went west) 2)	The three points then re-arranged themselves into a line; the line was almost perpendicular to their direction of travel [westward].<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)	Two times the three points seemed to collapse into 1 point, and then disperse into 3 points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4)	The linear conformation was the largest, I would judge it as being between 1.2 to 1.5 times the size of the moon at the time.   The trigonal conformation was slightly smaller than the size of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects velocity and more importantly their acceleration was outside of anything I have seen.  The objects moved across the night sky approximately 35-45 degrees westward from the initial point of sighting in about a minute.    As the objects moved west I lost sight of them in the glow cast off by Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My house is on the flight path for a few different airports in the area and object did not seem to be moving in a manner similar to normal air traffic over my home.  I have lived here for 20 years and feel that I have a sense of where the normal air traffic going into or leaving Seatac, Boeing field or Renton Municipal airport should be.  I completed pilot ground school and have logged a few hours in a Cessna, although I am not an expert I am familiar with aircraft.  In addition the US Navy Blue Angles perform over my house ever summer.    The objects I saw did not behave in a manner consistent with my experiences of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently completed a year of college physics and would say that the objects’ acceleration was amazing.  They seemed to keep a constant speed relative to the horizon while they made their maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not notice any sound associated with the objects, the points’ small size and lack of audible sound leads me to believe that this object was far away.  This is just an assumption I am making though; in my opinion it is very hard to accurately judge the size  or distances of airborne objects with the unaided eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no opinion as to what it was exactly I saw, but it was defiantly something unique that I will not soon forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to be an exceptionally capable observer.  We suspect that the witness may have observed something quite unusual.  Please see the other report from Albany, OR, for the same date.  PD))<n>

I slowed the car and we saw a four bright lights shaped on something round in the sky just floating. Not sure what it was i stopped the car we wathced for a nother couple seconds and then the object began to move. We fumbled for the cameras on our phones but as we did so i wathced the object just dissapear. It was cloudy that night and may have just gone behind a cloud but it did appear to be to low to do so. I have never seen a plane, helicopter, or know aircraft that looked like this or anything with lights as bright as they were on the front of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was a car, and didn&#39;t realize that there were any roads up there, so I watched out of curiosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it moved very slowly to the south.  I realized that this wasn&#39;t a car when it reached the edge of the ridge and disappeared.  I spotted it again as it cleared from behind the lower south edge of the ridge.  It drifted across the gap between two hills, and then it started following the contour of the hills. I then made haste to my back deck which faces west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light that I thought earlier was a car I soon realized it was just the edge of it showing over the hill.  I would guesstimate that it would&#39;ve been a craft 50+ feet across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it disappeared behind the second hill, the lower lights were covered enough to see flashing colored lights on the top.  It then came back into sight, then stopped for a few seconds, then started drifting to the north above the hill.  It drifted back and forth for a couple minutes, always following the contour of the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it drifted back into the gap and drifted up a bit, then stopped.  It remained sationary for about a minute, then started moving southeast.  Started moving slowly, then gained speed and elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watched it til fly out of sight.<n>
2/17/08 19:40|San Francisco|CA|Light|60-90 seconds|Object with bright light above San Francisco accelerated towards my plane at impossible speed for a normal aircraft|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63558.html|171|ndxe200802| Object with bright light above San Francisco accelerated towards my plane at impossible speed for a normal aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Sun Feb 17 2008 I was flying into SFO from Toronto on AC755. The time was about 10-15 minutes before our scheduled landing time of 7:52 PM, which would make it around 7:30-7:45 PM. We were flying over land that was spotted with some bodies of water. I was sitting on a window seat on the left side of the plane so I assume I was looking south. Here is a picture I found on the net that is similar to the view I had:  http://www.factionfive.com/blight/uploaded_images/DSC02804-771617.JPG. I would guess we were about 10,000 feet high, but perhaps someone more knowledgeable can estimate the height given the information above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was admiring the view when I noticed a light that was noticeably brighter than the other city lights coming from an object above a small body of water (like a small lake).  The shape appeared to be a sphere but I can&#39;t be sure as it was far away.  It was unusual enough to keep my attention. The light was a bright yellowish white but seemed to change to a bluish white and did not blink. It was moving very slowly so at first I thought it could be a helicopter. After observing it for about 30 seconds I felt it was not a helicopter and was definitely not a plane. What happened next is why I think it is worth reporting as a UFO; the object started to accelerate at a geometric rate. It quickly sped up and flew up towards the plane and passed below and in front of us in about 2-3 seconds. If I had to guess, I would say the object was 15,000 feet away when I first saw it over the lake and it came within 2000 feet of the plane when it passed under and front of my view. I may have the absolute distances wrong but the relative distance (2000:15000) is about correct.  The point is the object appeared to accelerate from almost nothing to beyond 1000 mph in about 2 seconds.  It happened so quickly and I was in disbelief by what I saw. I looked around at the other passengers hoping that someone else saw it but no one appeared to have. I recall a red glow on the lower half of the object but I am not confident about this particular detail (this happened over 3 months ago) but the rest I am confident of what I saw. I have never reported a UFO before. I would like to know if anyone else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But the sun, as it turns out, was farther south on the horizon.

At first it looked like a small silver spec about the size of a bright star. For about one and a half minutes it looked like it was coming directly down at me and the other security guard on duty as it grew larger. Then it stopped coming at us and changed direction to the Northwest. The object was closer now was definitely something metallic. At some points it looked like a sphere, and others it looked like different odd shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued moving northwest then it came back to the southeast for a few seconds. Then it changed direction back to the northwest very quickly and it no longer appeared metallic. For the rest of the time it was in view it looked to me like a black sphere.

One craft left, then the other craft changed and became a very bright red and pulsated. I was watching with binoculars. It had white around the outside and appeared round. It appeared to be lit from the inside, but was difficult to tell. As it glowed, it pulsated. The craft continued to travel south, then was just gone. Shortly after the sighitng I observed a commercial jet pass ovet at about 35,000 feet with a contrail. The jet was easily identifiable.

As i continued to drive south I saw that a craft was leaving the streaks. When I exited off of Rt. 17, I was proceeding east on soldier hill road, when I again saw the craft leaving the trails. I exited my vehicle, and noticed that the craft wasnt that high at all. I would estimate that it was only a couple of thousand feet. Yet, it made no noise. It was cylindrical in shape, and was criss-crossing the sky leaving these white contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I entered my vehicle, and as I was driving past the Oradell reservoir, I again saw the craft, and again I exited my vehicle to watch it. As it passed, I again noticed that it made no noise. I finally made my way home, when I again saw the craft. Leaving the white contrails (vapor trails). Some were several miles in length, and would widen to a couple of hundred feet. This time as the craft came overhead (again with no noise), I took some pictures, I got the trails (contrails, vapor trails - not really sure what they are). But, I could not get a clear picture of the craft. After I file this report, I will attempt to blow up some of the pictures to see if I see anything. If you would like copies of the photographs, I would be glad to forward them along.  The incident started about 6:45 and ended at 7:27.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks,  ((name deleted))<n>

In the East I seen what looked like a bright star, at fist I thought it was Venus, but it started getting brighter and brighter and it was moving closer, it wasn’t moving very fast probably just a little faster then a normal plane. It wasn&#39;t a plane beacuse it was a lot bigger and it didn&#39;t make any noise. For a few moments I thought it might have been a meteor rite. It was coming towards me and it looked like it was going to fly over my neighborhood, but instead it turned upwards and started to rise towards a patch of clouds. There was a break in the clouds and it flew up through them, and then into another higher patch of clouds and disappeared until I couldn’t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes after that I heard one or two millatary jets fly over out of the opposite direction in the West over my head towards where I seen the light go into clouds. I couldn’t see them though cause there was more clouds that moved in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I described everything on the phone to my friend as I was seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not sure what it was…  It could have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very large falling star... slow moving (for a fallinf star) that kinda fell/flew but then ascended upward back into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A plane with a huge bright light bigger then the plane strapped on the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ruled out it being a satellite or the space station cause it was under the clouds and sorta low and in mid sky within the earth’s atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me it’s a UFO… that’s what I got the feeling that it was, by the shape of it, and because it was Unidentified, Flying, and it was an Object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best I can describe it is a bright star that looked like Venus does on a good night which is what it looked like at first. Only it got 50 times bigger as it got closer. I could tell it was bigger then a plane it was glowing like a golden bright white light, oval and round in shape. It didn&#39;t make any sound. The maneuvers it made by flying towards me horizontally and then it moved upwards vertically into the clouds have to say that there was something was piloting it. This was defiantly something other then the norm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have any tapes or pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m writing this incace anyone else seen anything or got anything in a photo or on tape the night of Febuary the 16th or early in the morning on the 17th 2008 over Texas around the time after the cold front moved though. Maybe this would give some value to what they seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, the lights appeared to be moving in a very erratic/random fashion.  Looking through binoculars, the lights appeared to be circular dots chasing one another.  The effect was similar to when you move a sparkler quickly and randomly; thus seeming to create what resembled the appearance of string theory energy.  It was like a string light show, with the different colors chasing and blending with one another.  In instances the circular, oval shapes seemed to collapse, though never disappearing.  The lights would zip back and forth up, down, sideways, but always staying in a string configuration, whether open ended, or closed.  At the end of  twelve minutes, the lights just seemed to fade as if retreating farther into space.  What a sight!<n>

I walked back down the street and glanced back up at the sky at the base of the driveway. Still, only those few stars and the moon were out. I walked about 5 steps up my driveway, taking about 6 seconds to do so, and I happened to glance back up. Out of nowhere, a jet stream-like cloud (?) had appeared and the sky had opened up to reveal 20-30 more stars, including the full constellation of Orion. The whole sky had seemingly opened up with light from the moon (which seemed much brighter for some reason). The line passed across the sky horizontally, slightly curved and bended in some places, but tightly packed and not dispersing. I quickly realized that it was moving to the left, and it was moving quite quickly. I saw that the band of cloud was below Orion’s belt and moving slightly upwards as it continued to move to the left.  Within another minute or so, it was directly on the belt, and not more than a minute or two later, it was above the entire constellation, and still moving fast, not at all like anything I’d ever seen before. On the right, I could see the end of it clearly now, which was dispersing slightly. Looking to the left, I could see that it went on for some while in a solid line, bending here and there, but remaining entirely and completely tight and not spreading out or fading away like a normal jet stream would. I continued to watch it for another minute and tried to get a picture, but it didn’t come out, even with the use of a very strong flash. I saw that the line was starting to look a bit fuzzier than when I’d first glimpsed it, and the end of the line had passed over the house now, leaving all those bright glittering stars as the only things in the sky directly above my house. I walked out into the street for a better view and saw in the distance that the line was very fuzzy now, but somehow still remaining in a distinct squiggly fas! hion, li ke it’d only been blurred, not smudged or erased. I ran inside and tried to look out the back balcony and see if the cloud (or whatever it was) was still moving in the same direction. It was gone, the sky looked slightly fuzzier and not as clear and sharp as when I’d first looked up, but the stars that weren’t there 10 minutes ago were still twinkling shining brightly as ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

I noticed a triangular formation of three white lights off to the right side of the highway that seemed quite close.  The object was partly obscured by the trees along the highway, and for a few seconds it was completely hidden by them.  After a few seconds we could see it again because of a break in the trees, and it was much further away than it had been when first sighted.  My boyfriend was in the passenger seat, and we both agreed it was traveling faster than a plane would.  From inside the car with the windows up, we heard no noise.  The strangest thing about the lights was the formation.  It was as if they were on a flat surface facing us directly.  To better explain, if this had been a plane, it would have been as if  the plane&#39;s nose was pointing directly upward from the ground and we were looking at the bottom/top of the plane.  Even after it had gotten farther away, the lights were still in this perfect triangular shape.  The lights were not blinking, they were bright white and did not seem to give off a surrounding glow or beam.  I have reported seeing one other strange object in June of 2006, on the same highway, in relatively same area (Newport News/Williamsburg).<n> <n><n> <n><n> O    O                    O<n>

It was followed by a bright yellow-white streak, like a comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was driving and talking on the phone, so although I pointed at it and exclaimed, he did not see it before it dissapeared behind the mountains. It was moving rapidly, as if it were falling out of the sky, and it appeared to actually have a green ring of neon light around the edge like some sort of fair ride gone horribly wrong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it for 2-3 seconds, perhaps, and all I could think, was what in the HELL is that? I don’t really believe in UFOs, but…what was that??? It was, for me, at least, an unidentified flying object. I kept watching the western horizon for as long as I could, but saw nothing else strange. We stopped for dinner shortly thereafter, and after we ordered, police and fire trucks went by with sirens blazing, and I couldn’t help wondering if they were headed for the UFO crash!<n>

This occurred on a beautiful day in daylight hours with clear skys. All children concurred that they heard a loud roar and what also sounded as a sonic boom.  Approximately a minute latter they witnessed seven military jets possibly from the Portland Oregon Air Base, traveling in the direction from the north to south. The jets suddenly made an abrupt turn to the west in the direction of travel they last saw the craft traveling.  The children all concure that the craft was very large and as described by my son as at least as large as two houses.  They also said the craft had four green lights on the underside or belly of the craft. I tried to determine altitude by asking the children if it was traveling at a height were commercial jets fly. Their answer was about half the distance of were you would expect a commercial jet liner to fly.  I would estimate approximately 20,000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the source of this report, and he sounded to us to be quite serious minded.  PD))<n>

By my estimate they seemed to be on the other side of the bay in the direction of Oakland. Having grown up next to the SF Airport I knew right away they did not look like the lights from any plane I have ever seen before. Looking back and forth from the road to the lights I noticed they were not moving. I watched them for approx. 20 seconds. After another glance they disappeared. I had a clear view of the sky but were unable to see the lights anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky that evening was just starting to become overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We took tons of pictures of the 51 rd,  The Little Alie inn etc. etc. but right before we would drive down the 51 rd to the warning signs, we stopped and took pictures of myself and her at the famous sign that says Extraterrestrial highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were taking these pictures you can clearly see that on the times between shots were about 3-5 seconds per picture. The weather was crystal clear, and daytime. I took like 10 consecutive pictures of the sign and nothing out of the ordinary was in the pictures except for one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now we did not notice this object  when we were making our visit, but when we got home from our vacation I saw this strange object that was kind of the shape of  a boomerang mostly black and gray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn’t notice it while we were physically there but hopefully you guys can tell us and examine the picture of what  we saw.<n>

I told him it was plane, obviously.  He said “Not the plane, where did it go?”, then exclaimed and pointed “That!” I leaned forward in the truck to look up into the sky thru the windshield and  at the upper left side I saw a metallic disc shaped object which was brightly reflecting the sun. It was tilted at an angle toward us and didn’t seem to be moving at all but staying in one place while it tilted at those various degrees. We couldn’t tell if it made any sound or not because our windows were rolled up. I watched it for a few seconds in shock that I was seeing my first beyond a shadow of a doubt ufo , till I realized I had my camera with me and I told my husband to pull over on the side as its visibility was lost from me where I was sitting and fumbling for my camera to turn it on. When we got to an area and pulled over it was gone and no where to be seen anywhere in the sky. We stayed there for a while looking for it and hoping it might come back or maybe still be there and show itself again, but nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my husband about it and he said the reflection of the suns rays reflecting off of the shiny silver metal caught his eye and he look up  and saw it. At that time it was completely turned on its side so that he could see it was a perfectly shaped round disk. It was so close that it was about an inch in size and we could see the grooves where it had a small bump in the middle of it. As my husband was looking at it and asking me what it was, it turned “right” side up where he lost it for a second then it became “visible” again (and when I saw it), when it tilted at an angle and the suns rays reflected off of the metallic body again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other ufo that I, personally have seen and video taped was when we lived 30 miles out of Kingman, Arizona which was oval shaped and light in color but was pretty far away and was reported on the news that day to be seen all over Arizona (phoenix, flagstaff, Kingman etc) but it was explained as being a weather balloon. Now that one I would accept a lot more easily as possibly being a weather balloon but this ufo we saw yesterday was so CLEAR, DETAILED and in broad DAYLIGHT on a nice sunny day that we both (my husband and I) know it was real and like nothing we both have EVER seen before that could be logically explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/16/08 12:00|Panteago (Italy)||Circle|Hours|Large moon like object over Italian Dolomites.((NUFORC Note:  We have written the source, inquiring whether the report is a hoax.  PD))|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62000.html|196|ndxe200802| Large moon like object over Italian Dolomites<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have recently returned from a skiing holiday in Italy with my school. Whilst we were there a large almost circular object was in the sky from when we arrived at 8 in the morning until 5 in the evening on around four different days, three consecutive and one the day after a one day gap.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the object for the first time I mistook it for the moon, but I soon realized I was  wrong as the moon was in the sky at the same time as the object. I also checked if it was the sun but it wasn&#39;t. The object was almost a full circle but there seemed to be a small chunk missing from its bottom. The object looked to be about half the size of the moon which was visible at the time and was slightly bluer/grayer than the moon itself. As i have said earlier, for the first three days of the holiday the object was visible to the south but did not appear the next day and was visible the day after that to the east, but was considerable paler than before and blended in with the sky much more easily. As we were staying at a very busy ski resort many people from outside our school witnessed this too and an American man showed us a photo of the object which he had taken on his digital camera which when zoomed in looked as though there were hundreds of brightly lit windows on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, towards the end of the holiday the object was no longer visible, but my friends and I have many photos of it. One friend of mine has a zoomed in movie of the object in which the object seems to revolve very slowly. Another video taken, in the evening shows there to be about 4-6 small illuminated dots circling the object at what looks to be high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A video I have taken, this time not with the object in the frame shows three car sized disks slowly moving over trees in a circular fashion, (they were moving in a circular formation and circling like a carousel). As these disks were flying only a few feet over the trees I managed to estimate they were about the size of a large car (20x20 feet). These disks are very clear and seemed to be slightly reflective. Also gray/black lines are visible on the beneath of the disks. While I was filming I did not notice these disks even though they appear to be flying slowly at around 40mph and were within about 200 feet of me at the time and first noticed them while I played them back on the computer. I assure you that these are not aircraft or light specs because you cannot hear the object on the video and there is a reasonable amount of detail on the disks as my camera is 10mp. Also, I don&#39;t know If this has anything to do with the disks or not but on the day I filmed this, everyone I knew , including myself who had taken a camera or mobile phone with them skiing that day had problems with them. For example, my camera wouldn&#39;t always tern on or off when I wanted it too and sometimes the zoom had a mind of its own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you could advise me what to do with these videos I would be very grateful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have written the source, inquiring whether the report is a hoax.

It was just after 7:30pm. The weather was crystal clear. It was so clear tonight that I could see more stars than I’m normally able to. There was a lot of air traffic tonight as well, but something else caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 45 degrees above the horizon, a dim white light appeared. It was only as bright as a star, but it wasn’t there before. It seemed to be as bright as the brightest star in the sky. It seemed to turn left. The light dimmed as it appeared to turn and simply vanished. There was no flashing light. There were no red and green navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved quickly to a darker spot, away from parking lot lights, and kept my eye on the same spot in the sky, looking over in the direction it seemed to be going, and there was nothing there. I stood and waited for a while, looking for any flashing light, no matter how dim. I have good night vision, had been outside for a while, and 20/20 vision to boot. Nothing appeared. I could see other planes in the sky. Even planes further away could clearly be seen with much brighter lights and the tell-tale flashing navigation lights I’m used to seeing working by an airport all the time. This light was not over or near the airport, however. I believe it was very high up in the atmosphere and possibly off the coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact, I believe what I observed was a “Iridium satellite flare.” It would be my first time seeing one, if that’s what it was. I thought there would be more of a flash… This simply appeared and faded out after a few seconds. It was subtle, but it caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were a number of identifiable airplanes farther east of where I saw the object.  Maybe as many as 8 planes in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After a brief rest and trying to relax from the take off which is the most difficult time for me I decided I couldn&#39;t rest or relax so I sat up and decided to look out my window because this seems to get me out of my feeling state and into a visualizing state.  Well I look out and down to my left and there at about the 7 o&#39;clock position and I would guess maybe 1-2 thousand feet below and about the same out away from the left side of the aircraft was a huge round metallic ball about the size of I would guess two Volkswagen cars on top of one another.  These are all fair guesses because without any! thing to compare it to it&#39;s kind of hard but the one thing I know for sure is the shape and color and the fact that it didn&#39;t belong there.  I always said I felt it had to be moving at a good speed because we were at lease it seemed not pulling away from it very fast.  I guessed we were traveling at about 350 still increasing and climbing so it&#39;s speed I would guess maybe at 200 because I did watch it for about 20 seconds until it was too far behind.  At the time I was not into ufo stuff so it wasn&#39;t a big deal but non the less I new it was odd and out of place. If it happened now I would be yelling for the others to look no doubt and I would be filming cause now I carry a camera.  Note that I&#39;am an Major League Baseball scout and I&#39;m trained to observe and pay very close attention to detail.<n>

Looked up at the sky it was a clear night not to dark.  I immediately saw three lights in close proximity.  Two white with a red in the middle they were in a triangle pattern about 120 degrees at the center.  I thought it was a plane, looked away for a second when I looked back there was a second set of lights.  Tree limbs had obscured them.  These light were parallel to the first set and a mirror image of the first.  I thought for sure it was a plane.  As I watched it move from west to east at a very hi rate of speed it moved to a lighter sky and I could see a darker connecting structure between the lights.  I can’t figure out how I could see booth wing tips  if that’s what it was there was no fuselage per say and its speed was unmatched by any aircraft I have ever seen at that distance it covered my line of sight 4 or 5 seconds it wasn’t horizon to horizon but it was fairly large angle.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After 20 to 30 minutes my freind and my dad had gotton bored with looking throuh the telescope so my dad said he was going to take a shower and my freind decided to go back into his trailer which is next to mine.I decided to stay out longer. after about ten minutes alone after checking out the mmoon i decided to look around,i looked to the West over the ocean and had seen a Orange/Yellow ligth about 300 to 500 feet above the ocean traveling very slow down the coast,by this time i had ran to my freinds tralier which is 15 feet away fromm where i was standing and yelled at my freind to come see this ,he got out of his trailer and we seen this single light turn into 2 diffrent lights when i had seen that i ran over to my trailer and grabed my binoculors and about the time i was looking at the object it had changed colors to blue after seeing that i handed the binocs to my freind who then whached it pick up speed climbing higher in the sky till it disapeerd into space.about ten minuits of standing around trying to come up with a possible explanation we came to the conclusin it was a UFO..

The front of the craft was rectangler with rows of ligths on the very front ,and behind those sets of light was complete darkness alls you could see was a silhouette of the middle of the ufo and on the very en! d of it was a red light. the object than started heading over the ocean towards Crescent City California and whatched it fly over Crescent city then it started to fly East from there than it had abrubblty stoped for a minuite and it continued to fly east behind a moutain to where we could not see it anymore.

The husband and wife were indoors when their farm dog began barking nonstop for a few minutes after 8pm local time when the husband eventually goes outside to check on what reason the dog kept barking. The dog was looking out to the NE of the house in a field so the husband looks up in the sky to see three huge amber lights hovering silently he guesses about 300 feet above a cattle field. Two were close together and one was up and to the left of the others.  The lights glowed orange-red with short spike-like beams emanating around each light.  The dog settled down laying in the yard watching the lights.  The husband is startled by its silence causing him to be awed and spooked by the lights. Suddenly the lights blinked out and the husband rushed back into the house and got his wife to come outside to tell her about the lights.  The wife came out with a pair of binoculars.  They see the lights reappear again silently hovering but the husband said they moved further away to the NE but reconfigured into a different pattern of three lights.  The wife looking through the binoculars said she sees four lights in a rectangular pattern now hovering just above the trees in the distance.  The weather is clear and cool near 45F with a SW breeze.  The husband said the area is rural cattle ranches SW of West Plains, Mo.  The husband agreed to check with his neighbors to the NW to see if they saw anything or may have had any strange animal deaths in the area.  The husband said that he had a similar sighting about a year ago last March 07 with a straight line of four large amber lights again hovering silently over the same general vicinity that just blinked out and reappeared further away. The husband is unsure about any missing time. Just a note this area was hit by a tornado earlier this month near Bakersfield. Mo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I notices a bright light in the sky.  I continued to walk my dog and noticed the light seemed to be moving.  I stopped walking to look at the light.  It continued to move east across the sky.  I heard no noise at this time.  As the light moved across the sky it came closer to the half moon as if it was heading straight for it.  As it came closer to the moon the light of the moon swallowed it.  I watched to see the light continue on through to the other side of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for about 20 seconds but the light did not come out at the other side of the moon.  I then started to hear noise in the sky only to notice about five blinking lights which I would say were planes but the light I watched go into the moon still had not revealed itself.  The planes on the other hand were comming from different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear night and i usally will see maybe two or 3 in the sky at a time but this was diffrent.  There were alot of aircraft in the sky flying in clusters of 3 and fours heading north north east. It was very odd. When my wife got home about 15 minutes later i was telling her how odd it was to see so many aircraft in the sky at one time, at that point I went back outside to see a cluster of 3 aircraft flying in the same direction at which point i called my wife outside to show her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its is very weird that when checking this site to see if there have been any other sightings in the area I came across the people from wall township who saw similar events on the same date athough I saw it a little later in the evening.

It looked sort of like an opaque circular light bulb in the sky. As I watched, it seemed to stretch out and turn into a long oval before it disappeared from my vision (it went behind the trees and I couldn’t see it anymore). This all happened literally in a second, it was moving very fast. I really can’t tell how big it was because it was moving so quickly, but I think it was just slightly smaller, if not the same size, as the moon. It was moving from South to North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  One of several reports from the same source, and they seem to us only marginally credible.

And the light was getting bigger and bigger as it approached.  I told her to reach down and grab her cell phone and take a picture of it, but her phone was dead, i told her to grab mine, mine was dead.  Then i told here to grab her camera, but that to was dead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft arrives over the top of the car and it was absolutely silent, not one decibel of noise was in the air. it floated above us for about 10 min.  Then it started to move away, as it got farther and farther noise started to come back and the electronics turned back on, and started to vibrate a lot.  The aircraft slowly flew off into the distance behind the mountains and disappeared.  The aircraft was about 200 feet above me and orange. i don&#39;t know what this is and i need answers. please help me<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I live in the flight path of DFW airport as well as Love Field airport In the Dallas area.  I was out side noticing how clear the night was, The stars seem extra bright.  All the sudden I saw a Aircraft shaped like a boomerang flying over my house. What really got my attention was the craft had No lights were on at all. Again I live in the flight path of 2 Airports by the time Airplanes fly over my house their lights are blanking and they have all the landing gear lights on.  As this craft got closer I got a good look at the shape.  It was not like the stealth boomer (I&#39;ve seen many since I had 3 sons in the Navy) This was literally shaped like a boomerang&#39;s. It was moving across the sky going North East. It made NO Sound It was about the size of a DC10.  At the speed it was going I only saw it for a couple of minutes. However, I did get a good look at it.  With all the airplanes in the area I am wondering if a pilot might have seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought, it had to be a plane, but, I realized, I have never seen a plane going that fast. It is extremely flat here, so I had a good view of the length of the sky. It traveled that entire length, within 30 seconds and then suddenly, it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like that before. It did not emit blinking lights, like most planes do, instead, it was just a solid white(ish) light<n>

The following is how it was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While unloading my shopping bags, I heard a helicopter in the distance. After a few moments it was within view. The only thing obstructing my view was the roof of my house. The helicopter then cleared the roof and continued moving southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this moment in time,I was returning for my second trip to the car for the last of shopping bags. The noise of the helicopter was loud enough, to make me look again. I looked towards the helicopter and spotted another flying object near the helicopter. There was no noise from it, as far as I could tell. The helicopter continued moving southeast until another object appeared about 200 yards ahead. I say &#34;appeared&#34; because I did not actually see the craft arrive at that point. I was still focused on the first object; the second craft fell into my view as the helicopter moved into the space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this moment my wife was also starring at this strange sight. She said she was wondering what had grabbed my attention.I explained to her what I had seen so far. My daughter then came outside where my wife told her to look towards the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Craft 1 started to pulse from a dull yellow to a color of that from a BMW headlight, a bluish-purple.Within a few seconds Craft 1 left at an unknown speed heading north. This is the last I saw from Craft 1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While Craft 1 left the helicopter was still heading souteast and Craft 2 was now about 100 yards away. At this point I believe the pilot saw this object. The helicopter quickly, sharply turned due east towards Sunrise Mtn. The Craft hovered for a moment while the helicopter continued moving.The Craft then got in front of the helicopter, again baout 100 yards. I did not see the craft move as I can describe it is more of a blink and then it was there. At this moment I was aking both my daughter and wife if they were seeing what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The helicopter quickly and I stress quickly; turned head directly south. I saw the tail of the helicopter whip around and a higher exhaust note from it. The helicopter continued moving south with its nose down,tail high moving fast. The craft at this point moved along the side of the helicopter still 100 yards away. This mirror image of the craft and halicopter lasted about 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing that occured was that the craft stopped and redirected towards the north. It moved slowly at first and zoomed away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft were long about the same size as the helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pulse affect of the craft was as that of a squid when it is under stress.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed was awe inspiring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no known sound if any coming from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The helicopter was not a police or military aircfart,it seemed to be a medical helicopter.<n>

We pulled over because it seemed odd to us that there would be commercial airliners flying low and in a flight pattern. The presumed aircraft were directly in front of us as we were looking East at mile marker 362 on HWY 70. I had turned off my lights so we could get a better view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were watching the flashing lights, again presumed aircraft, and discussing whether they were military aircraft and were they practicing flying, just slightly to the North-east and out of nowhere we visualized six bright lights, not quite orange and not quite white in color, appear tilted and low to the ground. Four of lights remained almost steady for a couple of seconds then in succession, two more lights came on which allowed us to see the spherical shape and a 30 degree angle on the craft (above the lights). They disappeared one after the other, again giving us a visual of a sphere. Immediately I asked my brother if he just saw the same thing and he replied yes. It was so close (compared to the flashing lights we were originally attracted to) that the hair all over my body stood straight up and my heart starting pounding. I was fumbling for my cell camera and continue looking in the direction we saw the lights, when I saw four of the lights again a little higher, a little more north and in succession…ie first light flowed to the second, again giving off a perception that the craft was spherical. I was unable to capture a picture in time. So, as I was again fumbling (shaking) with my camera phone when we both saw the lights directly north of us and further away, this time there were 5 lights that followed in succession. Unable to capture an image as it was too far for a camera phone. Immediately after we saw the 3rd sighting, we noticed the flashing lights come out of formation and zigzag in front of us, still what appeared to be higher than the spherical craft. After about a minute of this, we saw the four flashing light craft take off quickly towards the south and seconds later heard the deafening roar of what sounded like jets. We waited for another 5 minutes to see if anything else would reappear, however, nothing else showed. During the few minutes we saw the 3 sightings, we were the only ones on that section of highway, however, shortly after the jets left there were 3 other cars that passed us (on e going east, the other two west).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything that seemed so odd. Also, we had the windows down after the 1st sighting, but never heard any noise until after we saw the 4 craft leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a higher education graduate with a prominent career in the healthcare field. My brother works in customer service. We were on our way to visit family and have been on this stretch of road numerous times over several years. The mountains we were close to, according to the map, are called Peloncillo Mountains.<n>

In relation- I had been looking at the big dipper and commented that it was standing on it&#39;s handle.....looking from that constellation&#39;s higherst star, moved my eyes straight across the sky to the left about 75 degrees.  My husband saw it first and remarked about seeing an odd light.  I saw nothing, and then it appeared.  It was more shaped like an eye, inside were maybe 3 different round lights, all orange/yellowish color.  The object was stationary.  Then the lights went out.  After almost 30 seconds, they appeared again, and stayed on about 20 seconds, and went out.  This happened twice, although the length of time the lights shined was not consistant.  We have been traveling this same road for twenty years and never seen any lights like this.  There are no towers in the area, and it is very rural.  For a size comparison...this object was about ten times larger than the biggest star visable with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I figured it was an airplane because we live next to the Quad City Airport.  However, as I entered a clearing between the trees I found that this object was moving at an extreme rate of speed.  It so happens that there was another airplane in the sky at the time and this object flew by the airplane like it was standing still.  My first thought was that maybe it was a fighter plane....but there was no sound and it was moving 2-3 times the speed of a fighter plane.  Second, I thought maybe a shooting star or meteorite.  Just as the object was disappearing into the horizon it shot straight upward.  So much for the shooting star or meteorite theory.  I have no idea what that thing was.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before.  All I know is that it freaked me out!<n>

One light seemed to travel ahead of the other light, then all of the sudden they seemed to be traveling together, then one light would lag behind and the other would travel up and then down quickly.  I can see the planes turning near the mountain preserves on approach to Sky Harbor, and I judged that the lights were approximately at an altitude of 8000 feet and about 20 miles from where I live.  The strange thing about the sighting was the irrational travel of the lights, and the speed at which they were traveling.  At times, it was as if they were not moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The intense white light was what initially caught my attention then the fact that they seemed to be motionless. As I drove forward I began to see that it was a metallic neutral tan color with lights blinking on either end.  I turned off the radio and opened the windows as I slowly drove under it and I heard no sound. It was shaped like a triangle with rounded corners. I did not see it again after I passed underneath it and did not return to investigate further. I am interested to know if anyone else saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moved faster than any plane,it made erratic right angle turns, first going west and then east, straight up, then it disappeared.  The sky was clear and the sun was shining. The size was hard to determine at that distance, but may have been the size of a car or larger, oval or round.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About one second and 45 Degrees across the sky later the object promptly made a complete 90 degree turn towards the south and one second later vanished out of view. I have watched many meteor showers looking the exact same direction in my backyard before and have never seen anything like this, the amazingly effortless change in direction made me immediately believe that it was a UFO. I was so shocked that I went quite on the phone for several seconds until I finally came to and alerted my friend of what I had just witnessed. Unfortunately he lives on the east coast and did not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After wards and upon checking my compass, I saw that the moon was lying West of me, and the asteroid came roughly from the south heading to the north. I observed this asteroid for approximately 25-30 seconds! Much to my amazement, I could see this asteroid quite clearly, and it was clear enough to see additional features on it. The only thing I am really not sure about is the size of this asteroid when it was going pass the moon and when comparing it with the space station that I once saw in my telescope. If I had to estimate the asteroid size, I would not hesitate to guess its size to be at least 4-5 times the size of space station in length but 1-2 times its size in width. This is clearly an endangerment to the world, and personally, a serious enough threat in my opinion to po! ssibly cause an worldwide extinction if it was to collide with earth. I will now explain and go through the sequence of events of what happened that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just come down the road from my mums, and I was going to my own home. It was almost 9.00 pm when I arrived to my house. As I was arriving, I was thinking about getting the telescope prepared for a night&#39;s viewing. So I went into my back room on the second floor where the telescope was being stored. The room has a large window that faces towards my back yard of where I live which has very little light pollution in that direction. Anyways, the window is always fully opened ventilating the house and keeping the telescope cooled. I have a Sky watcher 4 inch telescope (a run of the mill) with two eyepieces: a 25mm and a 10mm. Well, the 25mm is the one I used for viewing the moon and the sky, and I centered the telescope on the moon. I took a quick glance at the moon, then exited the room to make a cup of tea to drink,  then I went back to the telescope and casually peeked into the eyepiece.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moon had moved and the telescope was out of alignment for viewing the moon. So I carefully moved the telescope back into position as I was looking through the eyepiece. Then I saw this huge shadows of light,and dark like fingers beginning to appear in the telescope. I was saying to myself, &#34;Oh! What&#39;s that as I raised the telescope higher?&#34; I quickly centered right onto this asteroid. &#34;Wow!&#34; That was my first and immediate reaction this asteroid was tumbling slowly. I don&#39;t know how fast this asteroid was going, but it was moving slow enough to allow me to zoom in even more closer to it for viewing. It was Grey in color,and almost like pumice stone in composition, with various pot holes about it while it was tumbling around in a anticlockwise direction. I was mesmerized and captivated by it, I was concentrated on seeing more of  features that was on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you allow me to explain in inches hypothetically speaking  could be miles, it was quite oblong in length  if i say inches it could be miles it was 6-7 inches long by 2-3 inches wide, and it was also  quite well rounded as it appeared in the telescope. Then this piece that kept catching my eye was probably about 2 inches down. It would sort of step down, (say half a inch), then along 2 inches (maybe 3 inches), then this piece step back up. in this step down piece. It was almost dusty, and it had some mounds, could be hills!   with a few look-like potholes placed about it. I am able to remember every details of it, so I drew a picture of it afterwards while it was still fresh in my memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh, there is so much to say about this asteroid. Really. Anyways, I was so exited looking at this asteroid tumbling that I accidentally bumped the telescope into the side of my window frame with very much to my dismay. I pulled the telescope towards me to try get another sighting,  and I tried to align the asteroid back into my telescope view, but there was nothing. It was nowhere to be seen. &#34;Wow&#34;, I said to myself. &#34;This asteroid was in my sight for about 25-30 seconds and I still cant believe I saw it&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went through my kitchen to check on the time. The clock is a bit slow, or it could be a bit fast. Anyways, the clock said 25 minutes past 9 pm (gmt time) on the February 12, 2008. I swear this, it is a true event of that night, and I have no reason to lie. I told all the family, my brother&#39;s friend, I have told everyone i know  I didn&#39;t have a computer with internet access, but now I do.so i can research it , The asteroid is certainly a threat to our well being, and I believe its a cause for concern. &#34;It was anything else than an asteroid. And no way was it space junk or a satellite&#34;,as my local observatory told me. I said it was definately a rock, and they said it could not have been an asteroid. I&#39;m a stone mason by trade, and this was no boulder you might see in the back garden. No one seems to believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m telling you it was huge. Please help me. These astronomers  in chile pinged some asteroid on the 12th Feb. I don&#39;t know, but this one could have been it. Probably not, but what a coincidence...eh... the 12th here 13th there.maybe they pinged it farther on than the moon i don,t know  Anyways, please help me. I hope this info is of use to you. It was most certainly between our atmosphere and the moon and near earth&#39;s atmosphere. I would say it was traveling southerly to northerly on the time that I stated above. Oh, I live in Dalkieth, Scotland. I must have been in the right place at the right time to get it. These pictures I drew of it are going away because if the asteroid ever gets filmed and i have  drawings,  and if ever gets into the news, they may ask, &#34;How come you drew pictures of it?&#34; well i will say i warned everyone of it  That&#39;s my theory anyways. Although I have little in the way of proof, I know what I saw 100%. Also, I would like to say that I have now emailed a few people about it, and no one seems interested. These big telescopes look deep into space, and the observatory probably missed what is on there own back door. I trust you will give me some addresses, or at least point me in the right direction. I know it happened. There is no dou! bt about that. Are some people trying not to say anything about it because what is the use of putting the public in fear for a near miss? I trust this is not the case, because someone  somewhere must have saw it too. Some  web cam or some video of the night sky somewhere must have filmed it.if its been taped someone somewhere must have it on tape . If they have a tape of that night then it will be on it, if it isnt then it isnt a tape of that night because it should show up 100%.i fell so strongly against people telling me that i could not have saw it because how do they know  stranger thing have been believed  im unsure about the time because my clock is slow i never noticed it till one night when i took a pic of the clock and saw it was prob at least 11 mins slow  against camera time thanks for reading this and watch out if anyone can help you can request my email from the ufo centre.<n>

He saw a group of lights and pointed them out to me.  They were moving slowly and low in the sky.  There were two groups of four bright white lights, in a straight line, one larger group above the other smaller group, similar to the shape of the ship on Star Trek.  The entire group slowly turned to the right, then split into two separate groups, each a group of four bright white lights with a red light underneath.  The two groups slowly passed over us and continued on toward the southeast until out of sight.  There was no noise at all, completely silent.  I am sure that it was not airplanes or a blimp.  I tried to take photographs, but wasn&#39;t sure if I was getting anything because it was so dark.  When we looked at our pictures later, I was shocked to find not only the two groups I was focusing on, but three more groups of different colors in the photo as well.  In the photo they appear zig-zagging, but they did not look like this by plain eyesight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness 2 (19 y/o male):  It was around 9:00 pm, and my girlfriend and I were on the way to my house from the high school baseball game.  We were driving down the road and I noticed some strange lights in the sky.  I told her to look and she was surprised too.  There were four white lights and a red light.  The four white lights blinked in a rolling sequence and the red light did not blink at all.  I am sure they could not have been  planes because they were too close together and were moving very slowly and I could not hear anything.  They were low enough that I should have been able to hear something.  As they moved along, it seems that the red light was moving ahead of the white lights.  I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness 3 (40 y/o female):  I did not witness the event first hand.  My daughter called me at approximately 9:15 pm and was very excited.  She said that her and her boyfriend were heading to his house and saw strange lights in the sky.  They had stopped and were trying to get pictures.  She was very nervous and excited and was talking to me as they passed overhead.  She said they were low down and completely silent.  I could not hear anything over the phone.  She said they had been in a large configuration, that they looked like the ship on Star Trek, then broke apart and became two separate groups, but kept moving together.  I was trying to tell her to get photographs, and she was trying, but didn&#39;t think they would turn out.  She said she couldn&#39;t see anything solid, but the lights appeared to be moving as one object.  We were on the phone for several minutes, and they were moving on toward the southeast.  We were surprised to see the photos, and the appearance of other groups of lights they hadn&#39;t noticed. They were both very excited and certain that these were not planes. These kids are mature and not easily excitable.  We live in an area near an airforce base and major airport, and we are accustomed to seeing planes of all kinds, day and night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon walking outside I looked up at the sky because I heard a jet.  When I looked up I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  There was indeed a jet at a rather high altitude, but it was flying by a very low flying black, triangular craft.  The jet was clearly audible, but the triangle made no sound, and flew way too slow for it to be a commercial jet or anything of the sort. It had a strange array of lights, that outlined the triangular shape, three big lights, two white, one red (the red was in the front).  There were more lights, dim and seemed to pulse that outlined the sides of it that confirmed to me, that it was indeed a solid triangle.  The lights also didn&#39;t seem to illuminate it, which was rather eerie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jet soon passed it, and there was not a sound to be heard. It at very first seemed to be heading in the direction of the airport, but after moving my car, I noticed it wasn&#39;t heading in any direction in particular.  Rather, it moved in one direction, then seemed to slowly turn, and head in the opposite direction it was originally going. Note, the entire time this happened it had moved so slow, seriously could not believe it was there, I have seen low flying planes before, and this was no way that, I live near an airport, so it&#39;s a common thing for me to see.  I tried to get my friends attention to observe it, but he was in a rush, so only I saw it.  I did inform my friends upon getting inside his house that I had seen something that was truly strange flying over his house.  Sadly, I had no way of filming the object, but I can draw out a basic picture of what happened if need be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stared a few moments and began walking again. I stopped to talk with the safety guy and we watched it for at least 10 min. Others noticed us and began watching. You could see the air traffic from Sea-Tac well below the light. Once back on the aircraft carrier some of the Stennis officers and sailors had noticed it also, a couple of men maybe piolets because of their clothing said theres no way thats a hovering chopper.I figure at about 7:40 pm it flickerd twice and was gone, just blinked out. This light did not move in the slightest for up to 20 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What was remarkable was the speed at which it was going, about under five knots. Since this was in February, the sun sets earlier so it occurred between the end of dusk and the beginning of the night. It was a clear night with a few clouds and some stars that were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We realized after closer observance that it was one vehicle, not two.  It was hard to make out at first, but could see it was saucer/disk shaped and at a fairly low altitude moving slowly across the sky.  We guessed it was flying about the altitude a small plane would fly in our local area so we guessed it to be about the size of a football field across.  The light to the right went out, blinked, and then came on again after a second. and then flickered on and off again.  Then it turned westward while rotating around clockwise.  It then disappeared northward as it turned counterclockwise and moved over the mountain range and disappeared from our view.  (We deducted this because the light on the right side was above the other which made it seem to have turned that direction.)<n>

I realized that it was nearly dusk and each object was illuminated. The light was natural in color and dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They broke from the circular formation and began smoothly moving in and out of formation as they moved northwest. Two of them then separated and flew off a small distance from the group and then returned. The two crafts were synchronized in flight and unusually close together considering the maneuvers they were executing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching as they flew out of my line of sight to the NW. The crafts seemed to be 6 or 8 sided but generally circular in nature.<n>

The sphere emitted a light that changed in intensity, flashed in different patterns continuously.  The object looked to be somewhere between 35k and 40k feet (above contrails) and was moving at approximately 100-150 mph to the East/Southeast.  It stayed at approximately the same altitude for about 10 minutes before it descended to about 20k before it disappeared. I have seen weather balloons before and this object was not consistent with one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/12/08 05:20|Scottsdale|AZ|Unknown|20 seconds|I saw what appeared to be a star that blew up and faded away in seconds|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61561.html|249|ndxe200802| I saw what appeared to be a star that blew up and faded away in seconds<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking in the dark, early in the morning of 12 Feb 2008 in Scottsdale (northeast Phoenix), Arizona.  At around 5:20 AM MST (give or take a few minutes) I looked up in the clear sky and saw a very brite “star”.  At first I thought it was Venus, but immediately realized it was in the northern sky, and could not be Venus.  Besides, it appeared brighter than Venus.  I immediately assumed it was an airplane and looked down as I continued walking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few steps, I looked up again.  Instead of an airplane, I saw what appeared to be a star where I had seen the “airplane”.  Not a bright star, just an average star.  I then watched it as it quickly faded away, in a matter of 10 seconds or so, until nothing was there.  It did not appear to be moving, just fading away.  In complete silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen an airplane look like that.  First of all, when an airplane is that bright, it is coming toward you.  Second of all, it takes longer to fade out of sight when it is flying away.  And you usually see a flashing strobe light or the red and green wing lights.  But this just looked like a normal star that was fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rather than a UFO, I’d say this looked more like a star had just blown up and disappeared.  It was located in the northern sky to the left and below Polaris, forming an equilateral triangle with another star below  and to the right of Polaris.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/12/08 01:00|Wells|TX|Light|20 minutes|This is a report of a UFO event in the town of Wells,Texas|12/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105313.html|250|ndxe200802| This is a report of a UFO event in the town of Wells,Texas<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Report: Estimated date of event: 02/15/08 Time of event: 01:30- 01:50   This UFO event happened a few years ago when I was working as a regional truck driver at the time.  I have thought of this event over the years and for some reason I cannot forget that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was returning to Dallas from a trip from Louisiana with a backhaul.  As I normally do I was heading northbound on highway 69 north from Lufkin, TX, heading north toward the city of Rusk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I usually do this time of night I would take a break on side of the road just north of a small town called Wells, TX.  I would take a sleep break just north of town where highway 69 would open up from a two lane road to a four lane highway.  It was about 1 am in the morning when I would first stop and I had planned to stop for only for 15 minutes.  I would go into my sleeper, close the curtain, and go to sleep for a bit longer than I had planned.  I remember something waking me up and I had a feeling of something strange or abnormal.  I would come out the sleeper to look around to make sure no one or nothing was happening to my trailer as I would be responsible for it having stopped in such a remote area.  I then remember looking out the passenger side window and seeing brightness out the corner of my eye.  I then looked to directly out the window and I could see a bright yet dim light hovering over the tree line in the distance.  I had stopped before in areas in Louisi! ana next to oil refinery plants plenty of times before so I was thinking it was just the tower that burns off the gas from their refinery process.  As I continued to look at this light I realized the light didn’t burn like the flames I had seen at those plants yet it was illuminated like soft burning light bulb you have in your home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then started to look around to see if anyone else was around seeing the same thing I was but no one was coming from the north or southbound direction of the road.  I remember trying to see if this object had a shape of any kind but all I could see was the light coming from it. It seems to give off a little light over the trees but not enough to be extremely bright.  I then tried to figure out how far away the object was but all I could see was a field that seems to be about 200 yards from the trees and I can say the trees look to be about 25 to 30 feet tall at most.  I was going to try to get out the truck and try to walk closer but the field had a fence around it and also had cows in it as well.  The object didn’t move at all or anything it just sat over the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had heard of many companies in the area drilling for gas and I thought it could have been a light tower in their working area but the light wasn’t giving off any light that could lite up an area.  I continued to watch the object and I then rolled down the window and then turned off the truck to see if I could hear any sound from the object or anything around it.  It was complete silence except for a little cold air blowing from time to time.  The object’s light didn’t pulse or anything it just was a constant light glowing in the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch the light it would glow for about 5 more minutes and then all of a sudden it just went out.  No noise or movement it just went out without warning.  I sat there for a few more minutes to see if the light would come back but nothing at all came back.  I would then try to write details of the event to the best of my knowledge and at the time I didn’t have a phone with a camera on it.  To this day I have no idea what I saw that night but for some reason it sticks with me to this day.  Because of that night I would carry a cell phone with a good camera on it just in case I would see something strange again.  I cannot be sure if the date was correct but I do know that the time was correct because this was the time I would always get back to this part of Texas from Louisiana.  I truly wish I could find out what that was or even if anyone else had seen the object as well so I wouldn’t think I was just seeing things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I lost it in the sky my neighbor also saw it with me, i later around 2:20am notice it again but was too far, I only could make out the lights it was due west over the ocean, got my telescope again and saw it fly away into space.<n>

I was leaving Nebraska City on Highway 2 going westbound, when I saw something very large in the South/Southwestern sky. It was circular in shape but the only part of it emitting light was the bottom which looked crescent-like in its glow. When I originally saw it I just thought it was the moon, but I noticed it disappear and reappear in the sky in the west.  It then moved VERY fast to the north and then it dropped rapidly and sat down behind a hill. After it sat down I couldn’t see the object anymore. The objects glow was orange in color.  After seeing this I contacted the local sheriff’s office, and they already had a report that someone called in that they thought there was a fire at a local power plant, because they noticed an orange glare in the sky towards the plant then they watched the orange object move away from the plant and towards the west/northwest.  I work with two other people that saw it also. They left work 10 minutes before I did and they saw it and it disappeared, they just thought it was the moon disappearing behind some clouds. The thing about this is it was lightly snowing and the sky was completely overcast. I’ve never seen anything this huge in the sky in my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Lights blinked on and off.  Saw what appeared to be molten fire dripping from one light.  Lights would look like they each broke into smaller pieces and then congeal again into one.  Looked like red streaks would come from the center light toward the other lights.  Then the two outer lights would disppear and smaller lights would take their place. The middle light appeared to zig zag rapidly back and forth but would not really leave it&#39;s position in the sky.  The whole scene appeared to be like a Star Wars battle. I am still watching this and have been doing so for 2 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The object was bright blue twice the size of the north star and twice as bright. The object was circular in shape also very smooth. We spotted it 1/4 - 1/2 of a mile north west of our present location. The object dropped down from the sky at around 500 ft. It then dropped at a 45 degree angle to about 300 ft it then followed a straight line at an incredible speed then abruptly disappeared before it went over the horizon.No sound was heard and no trail of light was left.

2/11/08 21:00|Stroudsburg|PA|Unknown|6seconds|bright green light in the sky near the highway that  within seconds moved, paused, and vanished.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61550.html|258|ndxe200802| bright green light in the sky near the highway that  within seconds moved, paused, and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Sighting - 9pm, Feb. 11th, 2008 - Stroudsburg, PA  	I was driving home from NJ to the PA, on route 80 west. About 5 minutes after crossing the border into PA, while driving my car, I looked up and saw a fairly bright green light in the sky (the green light seemed to also have a little white to it, like as if it was a second smaller light). I watched it for about a second figuring it was just another plane, but about 2 seconds later this green light moved so fast (up and out toward the distance), in what it seemed was a straight line and stopped for a brief half-second at most, and then moved again and just vanished. The entire sighting was no more than 6 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To best way visualize this would be as described: If I was holding a ruler in my hand while watching this object, looking into the sky, it was a good few miles away. Now I can&#39;t be for sure because it was dark out and depth perception is a little difficult for the circumstances I was in, but it was definitely a mile away in the sky. If you were a 6 foot tall person sitting back in the seat viewing this, from the middle of the steeling wheel if you measure up about 10 inches that is where the green light was. It stood still for about 2 seconds, then moved very quickly almost instantly about 4 inches and 25 degrees to the right and up. This tells me it moved what it seemed would be a mile or more further away in a short period of time. After it moved 4 inches it paused for a second, and kept going very quickly into the distance but at about a 30 degree angle this time. This pause was barely a pause. It was almost a flawless movement but was not a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall, this was the first time I truly believe I&#39;ve seen a UFO. I feel like I&#39;ve never felt before after seeing that. It was like there was a lightning bug inches away from my car, and moved so quickly, and into the distance. I&#39;m glad I saw what I did. I feel like all the events in my life, leading up to this drive to PA, due to something that happened in my life, being at the right place at the right time, and seeing this UFO, is the reason past events happened in my life... just to see the UFO tonight! I will never forget it. Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When roughly overhead, a low rumbling like a distant large aircraft could be heard until they disappeared into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other aircraft (commercial planes etc) were in the sky, though I&#39;d say these lights were higher up from the angle as they flew into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First thought is that they were military craft on some sort of training exercise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, upon examining this streak more closely as driving and stopped at a traffic light, I could then clearly tell that the trail was dark black, like smoke from something burning, and also, this object, whatever it was, was falling from the sky, not flying.  The contrail was arching downward toward the ground like a rainbow at a very steep descent.  The direction was West to East.  Not sure if anyone else saw this or would notice it...I could not see any fire or tell what type of object was creating the contrail...but something was falling fast, so it appeared!<n>

They were clear as day, five SPHERES moving in formation, much too slowly to be planes. It almost seemed like they were moving too slow to even be able to fly. They were way too small to be blimps and shiny metallic. I would estimate they were about 2.5 miles away or less, and following the path of the 5 freeway. I also thought it was odd, because they appeared &#34;locked&#34; in formation with absolutely zero individual movement. I immediately went for my camera, because they just didn&#39;t seem to belong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was fumbling to grab my camera, I lost track of them once getting into the turning lane onto Hollywood Way, as they were blocked by the tall buildings. I was surprised to see them again when getting to Hollywood Way and Riverside Drive, where I finally got this picture. There are only four in this picture, because the 2nd from the right is blocked by the tree. I was getting honked at by people behind me and everyone walking on the street was looking to see what I was trying to get a picture of. I couldn&#39;t tell if they could see from their vantage points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over at the 76 Station at Hollywood Way and Alameda to get better pictures out of my car, but I could no longer locate them anywhere in the sky. It was very frustrating not being able to find them anywhere in the sky, especially after just getting a picture of them less than a minute before.<n>

I was working making deliveries and when I went to make a turn into a parking lot to my destination thats when I noticed a strange object in the sky( I believe NW sky area).  The object appeared to be white or a dull light silver color and it&#39;s shape almost resembled like an airplane but I could not identify it, something  about the object just didn&#39;t look right too me ( I&#39;m not good with distances but it was almost the size of half a dime from my perspective.).  The object also did not appear to be moving which bothered me a bit too.  I glanced at the object several times but I was also driving a small box truck so I could not keep my eyes on the object during the complete sighting.  I had to stop my truck at a stop sign in the parking lot and when I went to look up the object was gone.  I think now about it and something just seemed wrong about what I had seen earlier today, especially that it was in the clear skies and then gone within&#39; a matter of seconds!  It was cold, sunny &amp; clear today making the object visible if you were looking were I was you would definently be able to see it.  Anybody living in the Lancaster area see anything like what I had seen between 11:00-12:00PM today I would like to find out what it was, thankyou.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Then I noticed it was moving about eraticly then it would stop changed colors to bright white to a dim white.  It was a good distance from me high in the nights sky.  What was really  wierd is that I saw this UFO for about 3 weeks straight.  I got a telescope to try to see it close up and then It appeared to actually be a triangle shaped craft and then would get really bright giving it a round ball shape.  I tape recorded it one night and the movements I got and video was that of a bright ball moving side to side up and down.  My digital pictures turned out better and you&#39;ll see a bright round shape but when I zoomed in 4x on the photo the triangle shaped ship can be seen. I&#39;m not sure what to call it other than a UFO.  I&#39;ve been laughed at by my husband who seen it with his own eyes and chaulked it up to being a satalite.  Once I watched it from 5 AM to 7 AM when it was early blue sky out and it looked like just a star but no stars were out other than this ufo I watched suddenly took off shot straight up and in about 5 seconds was gone.  I couldn&#39;t sleep for a while and would wait to see it. I admit I was excited and a little creeped out at the same time.  But after 3 weeks all this activity stopped.  Now I&#39;m more convinced there are things out of this world but what it was I can&#39;t say really.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was going down Interstate 71 south, and then turned on to Ronald Regan Highway, traveling Westbound. Less than one minute later, at almost exactly 2:01 a.m. I saw an object falling from the sky. It was nearly straight ahead of me and a little to the left, so I would estimate it was in the West-Southwest direction of the sky from where I was located. The object was falling very rapidly so I only saw it for about 3 or 4 seconds. It was falling at an angle from right to left, at about 7 to 8 o’clock (as if looking at a clock handle).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were bright orange flames coming off the object. The object itself was really just a dark spot, but it looked like a dark oval (judging from the flames coming off of the sides essentially); I could only see the flames coming off of it. What really surprised me is how bight and orange the flames were. I have seen meteor showers before, and this looked nothing like a meteorite that I had seen before. The size was very large, and it looked like something was on fire and just falling out of the sky. I did not see if it made it to the horizon, as there were trees to the side of the highway. I sped up in my car trying to make it past the trees on the left to the next clear spot where I could see closer to the horizon, but that took about ten seconds and by that time the object had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It blinked and moved slowly in that one area. Catching my eye because i can see it go in and out of my blinds. I looked out the window and saw 2 other solid lights which looked like starts. Colored incandescent almost amber-like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing out of the ordinary? I&#39;ve slept with my blinds open for the 3 years Ive lived here and am used to seeing planes en route to LAX and helicopter flying around. This is the first time anything unusual has caught my eye. The two stationary objects looked like pinholes in the sky. As I look at the stars, they shimmer and have a bluish white color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 3 objects looked very far. they were in the same area for approx 45min, then i fell asleep<n>

I dont know the shape but the colors were beautiful as I told the police office I was so shook up I had no idea how big it was  he asked me as big as a football field hey I had no clue. The only sound i heard was my heart pounding in my ears. I must say it scared the crap out of me. I ran to get my phone and when I ran back to the door it was gone  But I had an awesome feeling  cant describe but it was like a giggle in my belly.

When ever there is motion close to the camera it will shoot a picture. They have many deer, turkey pictures etc. But on 2/10/08 there was a series of strange photos. It started at 8:14 am there is 3 pictures of something in sky with a huge light effect around it. It even covers the trees as you can see in the pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then at 8:41 pm it gets stranger still. Te first picture almost looks like a coat sleeve the 2nd maybe an outline of a leg and arm, but the 3rd picture is breathtaking. There is a face that is illuminated; you can make out many facial features. It is unlike anything I have ever seen. If this was not my parents etc. I would think it a hoax. But since it is my parents and I know better we are simply speechless as to what this could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PLEASE help us figure it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Black spots are due to photographing the rising sun with a digital camera.  &#34;Face&#34; looks like human face, placed very close to the camera, so that it is severely over-exposed by the intensity of the flash attachment.

Feeling that a commercial aircraft may have been  in the process of, or might have crashed in a city close by, I hastily went back inside and told the elderly woman for whom I work to switch the television to one of the major local news stations to see what was causing the strange sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hearing nothing on the news, I put the odd occurance out of my mind and continued with my work. At 11:00 I took my second break of the day and once again stepped outside. I looked at the sky and noticed an extremely unusual sight. Trails as of fighter jets littered an otherwise completely clear sky. confused, I stared at the trails trying to figure out which direction they were coming from. While I looked on, I noticed a cigar-shaped object  in the sky that was much higher than the jet trails I was seeing. I am sorry to say that I had only about 5 seconds in which to see this object and can give hardly any details about it&#39;s appearance. The object moved in a WSw direction and was, as best as I could tell, black in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am an Educational Assistant in a elementary Special Education classroom. My girlfriend works in homes of Mentally Retarded individuals providing living aids. We were on HWY 43E when we noticed a ball of light appeared from no where and headed for the ground. It then went into a straight line parallel to our wind shield (left). The object then stopped and once again headed for the ground. Then it went diagonally up and to the left and was gone.

To be sure this was not  a plan for a piece of shrapnel so I carried on observing this object. About ten minutes after I saw the first  red light another one appeared 60 degrees south. A short time after that a third light appeared an equilateral triangle. This stars stayed there for an hour until a fourth light one appeared in the middle of the triangles and all four of them formed one light , then they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

I was looking up at the stars because it was a very clear night and to the east is the Oakland Airport, so there are always lots of planes to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden to the northeast, I saw bright lights, which seemed to appear from nowhere and made the few plans in the sky look like distant stars. As they got closer, which took only 20 seconds or so, It looked like it could possibly be round, there were three rows of horizontal lights, maybe ten across on each row, each light five times bigger than the brightest star. They were not flashing, but at one point it seemed to turn, so the lights appeared to rotate slightly and the shape of the object changed into a wide V shape,I called out to my husband but by the time he got outside it had disappeared behind a building and I didn’t see it again.In all it lasted about a minute.I was looking east,it apeared from the northeast and it traveled south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never personally seen a UFO, my husband has, and I’ve always laughed at his description and told him it was just a plane, or possibly a star. I have lived here for nine years and the 7:30 dog walk is a nightly routine, and I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband just came in and dragged me outside to look at another “UFO”…it was a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The brighest of silver ever.  The brightest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky other than the sun appeared from the ocean two blocks to my house and I witnessed it at 9 o&#39;clock in the sky at it&#39;s closest to me where it&#39;s size was the diameter of the sun.  Then, it moved to 11 o&#39;clock in the sky, straight in front of me and backed away and stayed in the same place for approx. 20 minutes as a bright star in a clear blue non-cloudy sky over the ocean.  While clearly other planes that I see every day are bieng vectored to John Wayne airport, that were in the sky at the time.  This was clearly the  most beautiful silver color aircraft I have ever seen.  I can go on and on, but I think that&#39;s enough.  Words can&#39;t explain it, seeing is believing.

From arms lengths it was about 1 1/2 inches long. The estimated distance from me to the object was 1 1/2 to 2 miles away at an altitude of about two thousand feet. the object was stationary in the sky. The wind was blowing about 10 MPH. I was looking in a westerly direction walking down the 7th Fairway of 18 holes of golf I played today. The sky was perfectly clear...no clouds. Nothing else in the area of the sky where I was looking, not even birds. It was a dark silver or puter color, and there was no reflection from the object even though there was plenty of sunshine.

At first I didn&#39;t think anything of it then I began thinking; when I see airplanes at night flying overhead there are only two lights flashing, one on each wing, and both are colored white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well the lights on the aircraft where of different colors, and where flashing rapidly, faster than I have ever seen an  airplane lights flash.  Also, the where flashing in different orders; such like the red would flash, then the blue, then yellow, then white; all at random choice it seemed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object didn&#39;t seem to be moving, just sitting in the sky.  I cannot tell a definite shape because it was pitch dark all I saw were those lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The flag type blanket was above for two hours I caught it out of the corner of my eye otherwise I woul probably not noticed it Very hard to see if you did not happen to see it. Seemed to blend with the sky after noticing though I then observed for about two hours I stayed up late too watch it wondering if it would be around this morng at 3: o clock. I set my alarm and went back out at 3:o clock lokked closely and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was flying above the Rocky Mountains along the Front Range, and was at a very high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first night it flew south until it disappeared from sight on the southern horizon. This object flashed consistently at 2 second intervals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second night it followed the same route along the Front Range, but then arched east and gained more altitude until it disappeared. I watched this light for at least 2 minutes both nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first sighting, unrelated to the object, 2 planes were observed. I add this because the light I observed had no similarities to the lights on the planes. This was a single flash of light, not the cluster of flashes that we all know to be a plane.<n>

2/8/08 20:40|Puerto Vallarta (Mexico)||Cone|15 Minutes|They came from the West, changed directions numerous times and were very visible to the naked eye.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61496.html|292|ndxe200802| They came from the West, changed directions numerous times and were very visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or about 8:40 PM, February 08, 2008, my 8 friends and I returned to my home and watched three objects appear in the western sky, one at a time. My home is located on the Pacific Ocean beach about 25 miles north of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and faces almost due West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The evening sky was clear and many stars were visible. At about 8:40 PM we noticed a bright orange colored object rising up from directly west over the ocean. We had an unobstructed view. The first one we spotted appeared to be some object burning up in the atmosphere as the light was not steady, but flashing more like a fire. Distance is hard to determine but I would guess that when first spotted they were 5-7 miles away and as they proceeded towards being overhead, they went further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately retrieved my 24 power telescope to get a better view. As the first one reached approximately 40 degrees from the horizon and appeared to be getting closer, I could see that it was cone shaped. It had 4 or 5 dark lines extending from the ‘nose’ towards the ‘rear’. It was heading in an easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was approaching 80 degrees, almost straight overhead, a couple of my friends shouted that there was another one coming from the same direction as the first one. I re-directed my telescope toward the second one and observed that it was similar to the first one. It appeared to be getting further away, diminishing in size, as it reached about 45 degrees off the horizon. It then stopped crossing the sky and remained in its current position for about 5-8 more minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third object, similar in appearance, appeared coming from the same general direction as the two previous ones. I watched this one as it changed directions numerous times and seemed to approach the second one but not get too close. The general direction of its travels began as the others, from west to east, but it also turned toward the south and reversed direction as it approached the second one. It went back and forth changing directions 5-6 times and for about 10-30 seconds on each leg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, I tried to re-locate the first one with no luck as it was diminishing in size and brightness. I returned to watch the third one for about 3 more minutes, until I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three appeared to be of similar size and shape when we first spotted them. They all had coloration like that of an object burning up as it entered the atmosphere, very orange in color with the wide stripes extending from ‘front to rear’. The light emitted from them was flickering as a fire would, with occasional flashes of higher intensity. The flashes of fire were coming from the &#39;front&#39; of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that this is of some value to someone and of course, I hope that there are other sightings reported from this area with more detail.<n>

The object appeared larger than an aircraft carrier with solid white, yellow and amber colors around the sphere of the object. It hovered for about two minutes, then moved slowly upwards and away from us, toward the shore and into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don&#39;t know the constellation name but in the NNE sky I could see the triangle - 3 stars - and noticed a fourth and was surprised to see a fourth star?!  At about 10-15 degrees my daughter and I spotted an object that seemed closer to us than the stars. I would say perspectively it looked like it was about 15 miles from us. We looked around to see the airplane flight paths and watched that for about 2 minutes and decided it was not the same as an airplane.   We did not see this object move in any direction but we did see red flashing lights going around it in pattern almost.  The lights spinning around this object would speed up and then slow down.  We watched this thing for about 8-10 minutes and after the last cycle of flashing around this object it rapidly strobed may 6 or so times and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 seconds later we saw a dull white streak across the sky in a northerly direction and spotted another object in the North sky but it was glowing bluish somewhat hazy.  Just as the first object, it just disappeared after watching it for nearly 5 minutes.  About 2 or 3 minutes later, we spotted what looked like a military fighter jet flying in the direction we witnessed the first object - we could tell it was not a commercial jet because of it&#39;s profile.  It was flying fairly low - at least low enough for us to see the shape of the aircraft.  It is not common for military jets to fly over our house though there are several bases around us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter did attempt taking pictures of this second object, however, I&#39;m not sure if that is what was captured. I can forward upon request.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t know what it was and we are hoping we weren&#39;t the only ones who witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a low angle large reflected metallic glint in the sky and looked at the glint.  Turned out to be a wingless cigar shaped aluminum colored craft moving northerly at about 5000 feet or less in altitude.  The sight is very close to a landing path to a local airport and this craft is too high for aircraft in this particular area.  As I started to focus on the glint, I realized the craft just went up in the air about 5000 more feet and then third second, it was gone.  The craft when it went up in altitude did not move forward to go up, it just went &#34;backward&#34; from me, meaning it just went up in the sky in unbelievable speed with no sound and within 2 seconds, it was gone.  It never moved forward another foot from where it was when it was when I first saw it.    there was no wings or tail or any marking except it was grey metallic color in a cigar long shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

There was nothing to do so we decided to just look at the stars and talk about stuff. As we layed there, a boomerang shaped object approached from the right side of us. It had five lights on it. The lights on the object were perfect circles. They were dim, orange, yet a little yellow. At first I was shocked by the object, then I realized it must be a UFO. I shook my friend, however, it was like he was in a deep sleep. I turned my head back up to the object and it grew into four fingerlike objects, but yet they were all conjoined at the climax. Now the object had twelve lights. All of them were still the same color and the same form. There were three lights on each fingerlike connector. There was no sound while this object passed us. It gracefully passed by as if it was trying to sneak by. Then it shot into the sky leaving a brightly colored trail behind it. No sound at all. Finally my friend woke up and i asked him if he saw it. He said no and that he was asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We went out on to the deck and looked out over the trees.  (From the second floor it was, at arms length, the size of a quarter or a little bigger)  At first there was nothing.  Suddenly the sky lit up in bright colors.  They stayed on for about 5 seconds then went off.  I ran inside to get the camera.  I was able to get two shots.  While waiting to see if anything more would happen, two jets went flying by.  Coincidence? My husband, who did not come out to see, tried to explain it away.  Flares from military maneuvers.  Over residential areas?  Doesn&#39;t make sense.  We live about 5 miles south of Ft. Indiantown Gap about one mile off of I81.  There are jets and helicopters that frequently fly overhead but they can be heard.  This made no sound and was stationary in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to put the pictures on the computer to get a better look.  My daughter had just arrived home with a story of seeing a UFO while driving on I81.  She said it was round with lights all around the outside of it.  A light coming from the top.  She looked away for a moment and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, 2/12/08 the local paper published this article: The Patriot News Air Guard flares, not UFOs, lit sky http://www.pennlive.com/patriotnews/stories/index.ssf?/base/news/1202784007315510.xml&amp;coll=1  I am not buying it.

2/7/08 18:30|Palmyra (near Hershey/Harrisburg)|PA|Fireball|30 minutes|flame-colored lights splitting, descending, disappearing and reappearing|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61473.html|304|ndxe200802| flame-colored lights splitting, descending, disappearing and reappearing<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my way home from an evening walk I suddenly noticed the clouds above the neighborhood houses light up as if something large was burning behind the clouds with multiple cores of light, estimated four or more, roughly 30 degrees above the horizon in the northern sky. It then happened a second time less than a minute later, so I began to run toward where I might have a better vantage point, during which time the phenomenon occurred a third time, then did not reappear for approximately fifteen minutes. By this time I was standing between two fields and I could clearly see the horizon in the direction the objects appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, the objects began appearing much farther away, no more than ten degrees above the horizon NNW of my location in Palmyra. The lights would appear as if from a single source, then divide, forming a horizontal line of two to five distinct lights then descending a few degrees and vanishing. They were candle-flame in color, and appeared in this manner at least fourteen times in eight minutes, randomly covering an horizontal area of five or ten degrees.  I was able to take a camera phone picture of thirteen of these incidents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a lot of air traffic at the time, and there is a small airport nearby, but these were not planes for obvious reasons. I was thinking perhaps they were come kind of emergency flare, however flares don&#39;t split like that, at least to my knowledge, and I should have seen the lights of the aircraft dropping them if they were flares. Also, as I said, the lights did not emerge from the sky in such a pattern indicating that they were being dropped by an aircraft; they would appear randomly within at most ten degrees of horizon. If they were being dropped, it would have been, in my opinion, a very fast moving aircraft following an erratic flight pattern at exceptionally high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did notice several other observers in the Harrisburg area reporting similar phenomena on this site. Perhaps the incidents are related.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I would say about a foot length behind a pencil point or smaller sized object.  It flew very high and very fast.  It could possibly be a jet?

I looked up into the southern sky and saw what appeared to be 3 to 4 orange lights at a very high attitude, much higher then a helicoper can fly and they where moving very slowly back and forth. I grabbed my girlfriend and 2 pair of binocs and we both views this object for about 15 minutes until it ascended and disappeared from eye sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else saw this I would love to hear from you.

So I went back inside and told my grandmother what I saw and grabbed a pair of binoculars and we headed back outside. I peered through the binoculars and could barely see it, then I walker closer and peered back into the binoculars. What I saw was a circular-oval form of object with a glowing light around it. The light had an orange hue. Then it completely disappeared from view, I asked my grandmother to check it out and she said she didn’t see it anymore either.  We both thought that was weird, I took the binoculars and I saw it zoom to the right and came back to its old position and then disappeared from view again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking at the Manhattan skyline from the east looking west.  There are some smoke stacks toward the NW; a few hundred feet above the stacks were about ten of lights stretching at least a mile.  At first I thought I was helicopters, but it was very cloudy and dark that morning and I was surprised I could see the lights with such low visibility.  And it made no sense for helicopters to be at the same height in the same area.  I boarded my train because I didn’t want to be late to work and I couldn’t stay to see where it/they went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I watched it for over an hour before it made dramatic move and traveled NW at incredible speeds like shooting star!

The sky was clear with the exception of the steam coming out of the stacks of the local paper mill.  When slowing down to turn into the Tim Horton&#39;s parking lot, I took a quick glance towards the mill and saw a white orb or sphere &#34;flying&#34; above the mill. It was moving in and out of the steam coming out of the stacks. It was moving very quickly and kept making sharp turns without slowing down. When I parked my car, I watched the orb, for approximately fifteen seconds before it made another sharp ninety degree turn towards the sky and instantly dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/6/08 23:00|San Jose|CA|Unknown|8 minutes|Roaring noise over house that started and stopped suddenly four times, appearing to originate from different directions.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61469.html|316|ndxe200802| Roaring noise over house that started and stopped suddenly four times, appearing to originate from different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were watching TV in our room at around 11:00 PM when we heard a very loud roaring that sounded much like a large rocket booster and seemed to be right above the house. We live very near the San Jose International Airport, so hearing roaring noises in the sky is not unusual. What WAS unusual, however, was the volume, behavior, and the proximity of the sound to our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The normal flight path of aircraft into San Jose international airport puts them a few miles east of our home. However, whatever was causing the sound seemed to be directly above our house. Furthermore, it didn’t get louder (approaching our home) and then quieter (passing over and leaving our home). Rather, it was a very loud, very steady roaring noise that sounded as if it was directly over our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were lying in bed, and we both heard this roaring in the background as we were watching TV. The longer it went on without changing in pitch or volume (which would be an indication of movement towards or away from our home), the more that sort of “there’s something wrong here” alarm was going off in my head. Finally, after about three minutes of this steady roaring, we both looked at each other at the same time and vocalized our mutual curiosity as to the nature of that sound. She said, “what is that noise?”. I jokingly replied that it was probably a UFO, and she should pack her nice clothes because we might be about to take a ride. As soon as I had finished saying that, the sound stopped instantly. There was no winding down, there was no lowing of decibels, it was as if someone had just flicked a switch and turned it off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As if that wasn’t enough, it started up again after a few seconds in what seemed to be a different part of the sky, but still very close. The start of the sound was as instantaneous as the ending. It was just suddenly “on” again. Again, there was an extremely loud, very steady roaring for about a minute, and then it stopped suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my girlfriend was actually getting scared. She had lived in this area all her life and had NEVER heard anything like this before. When the roaring started a third time, I jumped through our window into the back yard (there was no screen) so I could get a better look at the night sky to try and get a visual on whatever was causing this noise. I was able to determine that the roaring seemed to be coming from the South, but was unable to see the source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran over to the patio door and knocked on it to get the attention of my roommate who was playing video games at the time, and told him to come out and listen. He did, and said to me, “it’s probably just an airplane.” Then it stopped suddenly, as it had done twice before and his attitude changed. Again, it had lasted about a minute and stopped for a few seconds only to start up again this time on the NORTH side of my home. Now he was clearly as curios as I was about the origin of this sound. The rumbling/roaring sound went on for about thirty seconds or so this time before it again stopped suddenly. It did not start up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/6/08 23:00|San Jose|CA|Unknown|8 minutes|Possible Explanations For Roaring Noises?|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61708.html|317|ndxe200802| Possible Explanations For Roaring Noises?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also experienced the intermittent, fairly loud roaring sound that other people reported here around San Jose on the evening of Feb. 6th at approximately 11:00 PM. It seemed to be a deep, low, intense rumbling off in the distance from my southwest San Jose location, that would stop and then start back up again. I could easily hear it while sitting and listening puzzledly at my computer within my enclosed apartment. I soon went outside and scanned the night sky, but couldn&#39;t see any aircraft that might be causing it. I even called a friend on the phone who lives a few doors down, but he didn&#39;t hear anything because of the volume of his TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have heard something exactly like this several times before over the years in the Santa Clara Valley, and surmised that it could have been the NASA Ames wind tunnel that was producing it. That&#39;s what I had read in the newspaper and saw reported on TV previously when I had heard this same kind of sound in years past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, there is/was? a rocket motor test facility south of San Jose that could also be capable of producing this same kind of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure if either the wind tunnel or this rocket test facility are still currently in operation, but they both could be possible explanations for these sounds. Also, I thought it might possibly a loud jet engine at the airport, not following anti-noise procedures. Curfew at Mineta San Jose International Airport begins at 11:00 PM, but jets sometimes still do operate after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Because I am not positive of the size of the craft, it is difficult to say exactly how high in the sky it was; but I would say it was approximately 15,000 feet up. The craft flew over in a path which seemed parallel to the earth, which lead me to believe that it wasn’t any kind of meteor. This certainly wasn’t a glare either…something traveled across the sky at a significantly rapid speed and then disappeared. Whatever it was, it was very large; the green light shone like a sunburst and was quite larger than any of the other lights seen on nearby aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Appeared to have bright white lights around the 3 sides we could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My two daughters and I were returning home after skating on 02/06/08.  As we turned onto our street we noticed a circular type open with lights on the three sides that we could see.  It was very dark, but it obviously had lights that seemed to go around the object.  It was low in the sky.  Much lower then the height at which airplanes in the area normally fly.  The object was in the sky to the  Northeast.  When we finally parked in the driveway we looked to the sky again and the object appeared to be moving toward the West.  We listened closely to for a sound, but there was none.  I would say at the time the object was about 3 houses away.  So we would have heard the sound of engines if it were an aircraft.  The object was flying very low, just above the tree tops.  At this time my daughters and I ran into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This time it was further away. But here&#39;s the good part, 2 jets were swarming this thing and right as they got kind of close it would disappear. Once the jets flew by were it was it would come up a little ways away from were it blacked out. These jets when it would light back up (UFO) they would turn in a bank and come back and just watching these jets was wild the way they were &#34;chasing&#34; the UFO. Those things can move fast. But once again the night time crew saw all of this also and with my co-worker &amp; I and the crew that makes 7 witnesses. At what I would call the end of this sighting it looked like something fell right where it was located. It looked like a meteor but as it neared the ground in about a 45 degree drop it seemed like it righted itself and paralleled the ground then disappeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Although it &#34;exploded&#34;, there was no fire, just a small poof of blue light which caused it to stop moving in its linear direction.  After it &#34;exploded&#34; it all disappeared really fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was rather easy to see, despite the fact that I was around a main street where there were plenty bright lights.

It was dark out.  We were driving down Green Hill Road in Gainesville towards Ledan Road and right up in front of us just above the trees was a large group of white lights.  They were very bright and  very still.  They were lined up all in a row horizontally very close to each other.  I remember there being about 5 or 6 of them, my son says there were 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a plane flying around them to the right.  The thing that was so striking was how still they were.  They just totally didn’t move for the minute or so that we came down the road.  The plane flying around them was moving all around but the objects just hovered there.  I am not good at all with size or distance, but I’ll tell you what it looked like from where I was.  It was about 6 inches long, only about 6-12 inches above the tree line and appeared to be less than a mile from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 35 year old stay at home mom of 2.  I am not sure that I have ever really believed in U. F. O. s before, but I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I immediately called my husband at work as soon as I turned onto another road and could not view them anymore and told him all about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our way home from picking up my daughter, we looked in the same exact area and nothing was there.  I have been racking my brain trying to figure out what they could have been.  I came right home from picking up my daughter to search the internet to see if anyone else in my area saw something strange in the sky tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 6 year old son was also a witness and he was amazed by the sight too.  He counted the lights and remembered there were 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Seen near military base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When traveling home on Highway 85/87, I witnessed a large, low flying, black triangular craft traveling sideways. The craft had multiple lights on its underside, placed in a triangular pattern, as well as outlining the craft. I turned onto another road, and followed the craft east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw nothing for about 4 or 5 minutes, then out of nowhere the craft floated above my vehicle. I pulled my car over, and watched as the craft slightly descended and glided over me. At this moment I determined that this could not be an airplane, as I could clearly see the entire outline of the craft. Upon reaching south Powers Boulevard, a second craft appeared, identical to the one previous. This craft again descended and glided over me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became panicked as the craft continued to move in my direction. I turned my car around and began to travel west, towards my home. Eventually the craft ascended away from me, traveling north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third craft, identical to the previous two, was barely visible. However it was traveling in the same direction, at a higher altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We continued to watch this and saw red and white lights flashing in no patterned way. The red light was in the middle and was the brightest. The white lights flashed to the sides. The lights went from side to side horizontally and were not in sequence. At some times the lights were brighter than others. The lights messed with our vision. It sometimes looked like the object was 3d and then looked like it was flat. We were looking up at about a 30 to 45 degree angle. The object dropped quickly out of out sight behind a 2 story building. We both stepped backwards to see if we could see it again and noticed it right above the building at about a 10 to 15 degree angle. It stayed there for 15-20 seconds then the object looked like it was going away from us very fast and straight up not out. The only light that was visible was the bright red one. After about 2 seconds it was gone and has not returned. The sighting lasted about 1 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving very fast did not make any noise or any type of trail. There were other air traffic in the sky. It was not an aircaraft. I have seen fighter air crafts fly over the skies before this thing flew effortless and very fast it only lasted about 5 to 10 seconds before it dissappear in to the horizon. I later contacted few news agancies and miramar air base as well as march field air base, both air bases were no help.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was too bright to be a star, or a plane. I called over my dad, he of course said it was nothing, but I still thought what I saw was a UFO. I decided to just forget about it.  But, I kept looking out the window to see if it was still there.  After about 45 minutes, it just disappeared. Like a light switch going on and off.  And when it went away, there was like a... almost trail left behind it.  Like a light colored streak in the sky.<n>

Tonight at around 8:50pm, I was walking here on location and happened to look off to the north and seen about 5 spherical flaming orange lights at an estimated 3000-4000 ft. The crew here saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was really weird and makes this a &#34;strange occurrence&#34; is that 2 of the lights disappeared and came up what was probably a couple thousand feet away to the right and down about a thousand or so feet. I’m guessing they were about maybe 2 miles away or so? I looked at them for probably 20-30 seconds before disappearing. Not really sure but needless to say, close enough. After they all together disappeared, a couple of the rig hands came down off the rig and I walked over and talked to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where it gets even more interesting. One of the guys said he had seen these very lights just about an hour before I saw them and once more a couple of nights ago.<n>

When i first saw the object it was about 900ft away then it started to rise, once it reached about the level of a air plane it started making circles, not complete circles but almost. after spining like that for about 30sec it made a w and stayed like that not moving at all for about 1-2min then it make a &#34;s&#34; like shape and looked like a snake. this all lasted like 5mins, then it made a &#34;c&#34; like shape and started to move slowly across the sky, slower then a airplane. Me and my wife have both been sitting about thinking about what it could of been but i still can&#39;t figure it out and its been drirving me crazy thanks for listening PHX,AZ<n>
2/4/08 20:05|Granite Bay|CA|Other|10 minutes|Large blimp-like object hovering with multiple white bright lighte, leaving quickly at a rapid speed|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61440.html|338|ndxe200802| Large blimp-like object hovering with multiple white bright lighte, leaving quickly at a rapid speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving north on Folsom-Auburn rd from the city of Folsom toward Granite Bay.  First spotted what appeared to me to be a large aircraft with I’m guessing 2 to 3 lights, very bright white, almost directly inline in the direction I was traveling.  This was just a little south of Folsom Damn Road. My initial impression was of a  commercial aircraft with landing lights on heading toward me.  Based on this assumption,  my estimate was that it was over the Roseville-Rocklin vicinity, maybe 10-15 miles distant.  This was a winding, slightly hilly road and I was driving between 45-50 mph.  Initially it was within my view for a few minutes consistently.  I did not focus on it all the time but was interested in figuring out maybe what it was since it seemed unusual in it’s flight path for the area.  Most commercial lights run E/W  and having landing lights at that position seemed premature, especially for any southbound flight path  toward the old Mather AFB where I know there is corporate commercial traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I proceeded north, the road became more winding, with many tall trees bordering it.  My view of the craft became more intermittent.  My focus was on driving safely, since I still assumed it was nothing  more than an aircraft.  But I still tried to keep a general eye on it.   Not knowing whether the winding road was affecting by judgment, my distinct impression was maybe it was gradually swerving in a gentle turn slightly west.  The trees along the west side of the road were interrupting any continuous view to just a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached at some point seemed to be stationary in it’s position.  Without being positive one way or another, it is possible it was stationary more or less from the point I first saw it.  At this point I assumed it was a helicopter, with not the ordinary display of lights.   This still seemed off since this is not an area I would ordinary think of helicopters.  These lights were not searchlight, as the they were not scanning and there was not light stream through the sky.  At approximately 2 - 1 ½ miles of Douglas road it was evident the object was hovering within a mile ahead maybe ½ - ¾  west of  Folsom Auburn Rd.  Not knowing it’s size but based on my speed an approaching it I  would guess it was between 500 - 1000 feet in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was pretty sure it was not a helicopter.  There was no noise associated with it.  The lights were more blurry at  this point,  not knowing whether it was due to cloud overcast or moisture in the air.  My observation was still limited to quick glances of it when it came into view.  My distinct  impression of it at this point was of something poivnting E/W, large hovering with some type of frame of lights on its south facing side.  At this point I felt it had to be a blimp, or some very large balloon like object.  I felt I needed to pull of to get a better &amp; consistent view of it.  There was a single vehicle behind me, following closely but no shoulder to safely pull over.  I knew there was a place to turn off right within a couple hundred yards so I kept proceeding.  At this point I was approaching being perpendicular with the object to the East.   At this point I was able to see some of its outline.  The sky was fairly dark and I could see slight difference in the shade of darkness between the object and the background sky.  I saw it twice for just a split second each time.  It seemed I was mostly seen maybe the top right quarter of the object, and the closest I can say was it appeared do be blimp-like.  The top portion ran E/W slight curving downward East with it changing to something indistinguishable at its end.  The light were still on but much less visible and bright,  seemed to be slight away from the body of the object.  My impression of the lights were very indistinct, blurry, maybe shadowy, if that makes sense.  There was awareness of a bulk behind them but at the same time I saw nothing distinct that you would think you would see based on the lights even if they were pointing away from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lived in Southern California for thirty years until the early 1980’s, and seeing blimps were a very common occurrence living in northern Torrance near the Goodyear blimp airfield in Carson.  This just seemed different.  Too low to the ground where there was no imminent landing.  The lights were different.  Not like the normal running lights of an airship and definitely not like the commercial lights for ad display.  There was no familiar hum of the engines.  There was absolutely no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As pulled past it slightly the lights were less easily seen, my assumption because I was now behind it , more toward it’s north side.  I pulled over on the next intersection at Fuller St. and made a quick U-turn and pulled over to the curb, expecting to see the objection facing west at maybe 10-11 o’clock.  But to my surprise, it was already moving south,  much quicker than I anticipated, especially since I assumed it was a balloon like object.  I could still  see lights but much dimmer and it was moving south still.  I’m guessing maybe at this point it was 1-2 miles away already.  This shocked me.  Blimps do not move that fast.  But at the same time, it did not seem to pulling away at a fantastic speed.  I decided that if it was a blimp like object I should be at least able to keep in view for awhile if I headed back south in direction I came and the direction it was proceeding so I turned left back on Auburn Folsom Rd.  I had to wait from 5-10 seconds for the light to change.  Already the object was I’m guessing was at least 5 mi, so I was anxious but still I followed.  I only caught a glimpse of the light a couple time over thles away next 5 minutes.  Losing sight due to the winding road and the trees.  I knew after I got closer to Folsom Damn Road my view would open up and then I might be able to reacquire my observation.  My impression was that since I was no longer able to see the lights that it had moved back east across the road and that I had missed this flight path.  When I got to the clear area it definitely not south or southwest.  It was not in the air east either but I concluded the only possible conclusion for the disappearance of the craft was it went east over Lake Folsom or landed in that direction.  I thought all of the assumptions were very slim.  I was just trying to think of a rational logical explanation for what I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I heard this story from someone I would be skeptical.  I would assume there were flaw in persons observations, logistically in the least.  I am not one to make any fantastical assumptions about anything in life.  I ALWAYS assume a logical explanation for everything that seems less than logical.  I am very observant and analytical.  Its what I do and who I am.  Most people would consider me very intelligent and very informed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If someone could explain to me possible scenarios to what I observed I would welcome them.  Based on my experience I can think of absolutely nothing that would conform to my observations.  Thought I will admit my view of the object were fleeting and less than very distinct,  they were such that they were very analytical.  I would definitely refute anybody’s allegation of anything that would explain it that did not fall in line with what I observed.  But at the same time I would accept that would explain it that made sense.  But my sense of the timing and logistics were very accurate.   I would say my guestimates of distance and height are  subject to some question based on the size of the object and never getting more the a second or two glimpse of it, my ability to gauge these things has always been way above average.  I am a very observant fellow.  I do not base my observations on whims like most people.  If I say something, it is.  If I’m not sure, I will say so without problem.  If I don’t know, I will say so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as my thoughts whether this was observed by anyone else, until I figured out it was hovering, I doubt if most people in the cars would have assumed anything abnormal.  If I lived in the vicinity of where it was hovering and was outside,  I’m guessing if I saw it I would had observed it.  I’m guessing within a mile of the object, anyone walking or outside would have definitely after seeing it, would have continued to observe it.  It was a cool night and maybe two hours after sundown.  The air was generally still and the sky seemed mostly overcast but I could distinguish of couple of stars.  This a suburban, semi-rural area.   There seemed to be slight reflection of city lights off the overcast clouds but getting darker definitely as you move East, with it getting much darker just about at the juncture of Auburn-Folsom road, with the definite effect of the large Lake Folsom to the immediate east.  When I saw the silhouette, this difference in shade of darkness of the object and sky was very slight but enough to distinguish the shape that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If needed I could make a cursory drawing of what I saw.  It was not a whole image.  I do not have scanner available at this moment but could do so if it would help.  The drawing would be rudimentary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I stood up to gain a better view at which point student in front of me asked if I had seen the object as well. The object was in view for no more 5-6 seconds. The object was not a reflection because it passed behind a tree&#39;s several branches and behind the projecting corner of the building I was in at the time.  Object appeared to be moving too fast to be far away, i.e. if it were a plane at the distance estimated the plane was moving faster then any plane I have ever seen.  If it were closer then I have estimated I should have been able to see wings or a tail. The object appeared to not be falling from the sky nor racing upwards but maintained a steady lateral vector.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to be at very high altitude and so were two or three times as large as the biggest stars in the sky. They were amber in color but it was more of a glow than a direct light source. They moved very quickly, much faster than any conventional aircraft as they went from the edge of the eastern horizon to the western skyline in about one minute. The objects flew in formation, but were constantly moving around one another in erratic sideways and diagonal movements that conventional aircraft are incapable of. While the movements were erratic they did seem coordinated and with purpose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I see air traffic from the Nashville airport at night all the time, but this object had no lights. It was solid black, and it traveled much slower than any other air traffic. In fact, a jet flew past at the same time the object was in the sky, and the jet had several lights. They had to have been less than a quarter of a mile away from each other. I had time to get my brother from inside to come see it. We both watched it for about 20 seconds.

At approximately 9:45 P.M. I was on the balcony when I noticed a round dull red/orange ball the size of a small moon coming along the water about 50 feet off shore, 1000 to 1200 feet away from me, going about 30-35 mph. The height seemed almost the same as the 23rd floor of the hotel, but it could have been one or two floors higher. Behind it approximately 800 to 1000 feet was another round ball, the same size but it was a much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dull one passed in front of me and continued on for approximately another100 feet, turned 180 degrees and proceeded back in the direction it had come from still about 50 feet out from the shoreline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second one almost duplicated the turn but may have gone a little further before turning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole viewing took three or four minutes.

Our property is often flown over by both types of aircraft (planes and helicopters).  This was a very bright white light that did not flash.  Was brighter that a normal spot light or landing light.  There was also no red or green flashing as on other aircraft.  The craft appeared to be lower than the cloud cover.  There was cloud cover but not dense, could still see stars through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no noise, in fact as I was watching this object a regular aircraft flying from the east to the west flew over and was at a higher altitude and I heard this plane with no problems.  Continued to watch the unknown craft until it disappeared to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly, out of nowhere, I see this blue ball of light flash across the sky. It had no tail, it was silent and it vanished. My first thoughts were; was that a comet? was that some sort of shooting star? The only problem I had with either of those theories was that the object was heading away from earth. I&#39;m not sure what this was but I&#39;m very curious to find out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Much brighter and larger looking than brightest stars.  As it approached my position on my well-lit street (was walking dog), first thought was witnessing meteorite, but its luminosity did not waver except in a minute, slightly irregular way, and the complete lack of trail suggested not meteorite.   Continued directly overhead more quickly than any jet (Langley Air Force base gives us daily F-22 overflights).  No flashing lights -- orange light from single source, not several as would be seen on aircraft;  no strobes.   Flew straight and steady into distance.  Total visibility time approximately one minute or slightly more.  ISS flyover shown to be 6:30 p.m. earlier in the evening according to NASA website, so this is ruled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It had two green lights and two white lights, although not configured or spaced as they would be if they were on the aircraft&#39;s wings. In anycase, the aircraft disappeared from view just as quickly as it appeared. It was a clear night. A lot has happened in this area since that day---I have kind of lost track of days, so it may have been Friday night the 1st that this happened? And the time frame is approximate as we really weren&#39;t expecting to see something like this, nor were we prepared to record the incident as such. It happened nonetheless.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife, two daughters, and I arrived home from a school event. When we got out of the car, I glanced up at the clear night sky and noticed two very bright white lights centered between the bottom two stars of the constellation Orion. They were not flashing or twinkling and looked in brightness like the planet Venus, but they were two lights. I pointed the lights out to my wife and daughters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the stationary bright lights for about 1 minute, trying to make sense of what we were seeing. Then the lights suddenly began to dim as though moving away at a high rate of speed and moved slightly up in tandem. After about 3 or 4 seconds the lights no longer visible at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went into our home and I checked the program Starry Night Pro Plus 6 on our home computer to see if any astronomical event was occurring in the vicinity of Orion that might explain what we had just seen. Nothing should have been visible in the area of Orion where we saw the lights, between the bottom two stars of the constellation<n>

We were on the U.S. 60.   My wife was driving and I looked out in front of me at what I thought was a funny smoke shape about 30 miles plus away.  It had a ribbon like shape and was vertical  thus my thought it was smoke.  However it was in the middle of the horizon and maintained its shape for the entire duration of this experience.  I continued to watch this trying to figure out what it could be.  It seemed to appear and disappear over and over with a waving like motion.  I then saw these round like puffs that looked like something bursting in the air like when you see movies of flack but the &#34;smoke&#34; was white in color.  What really seemed strange was that this explosion then seemed to reverse in outward movement to inward and more condensed.  It was then that about 10 Miles away I saw something that looked at first like a hot air balloon going through fog.  It was at that moment that I thought, &#34;Wow&#34; there is fog really low going horizontal to the freeway.  Then it appeared again even closer and it the object came into view and looked more like the front end of a blimp, however it was huge.  I thought, wow that fog is alot closer to the ground than I thought and the blimp looked as if it was within 30 feet to the right of us.  It was then that I saw that my eyes seemed to adjust and realize that what I was thinking was a low fog was a very high cloud and around along ways away.  I yelled out loud, &#34;WHAT IS THAT?  I realized that whatever it was, it was the largest object I had ever seen.  I told my wife to look but she was driving and could not see what I was looking at.  It was at that time that we passed the 202 ramp and the 60 dipped.  I watched the object all the way until the wall next to the freeway covered my view.  My wife kept saying, &#34;should I pull over?&#34;   I didn&#39;t know what to do.  I kept waiting and looking to where I thought it would emerge from the end of the cloud into open blue sky.  It had been! clear a ll day and we where out at our with our friends and so clouds were the last thing I expected.  I did not regain view of the clouds where the object was seen and I told my wife to exit the freeway.  She exited the freeway at power road as I looked into the sky looking back and forth scanning the whole area for a low flying hot air balloon a blimp or something else as the path seemed to be heading toward the opening sky.  We drove north on power until Broadway and never again saw this object.  It was then that I saw  a jet flying in the opposite direction as the object I saw and the jet was still pretty high flying the normal pattern toward PHX Sky Harbor airport.  I gasped when I realized the magnitude of what I had seen.  The object dwarfed the plane like a plane against an upside down mountain.  I continued to reflect back on what I had seen and can only say that it was only the front end blimp shaped in front and the smoke like ribbon was the same object passing through the clouds giving the solid object the smoky like appearance.  It was not a cloud behind another cloud. It was a definite Oval object and I would estimate it from just the nose and from how far away the clouds where that it was bigger than the size of the city of Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was, or what it belonged to. I know that I saw something and I know that it was a solid object.  I have never seen anything that big except for a mountain.  It was not a mountain.  The object I saw was skimming through the clouds and because of its huge size it through my perception of the actual distance of the clouds way off.  The planes that flew in toward Sky Harbor were still very high above the ground and the clouds where still higher in the air then they were.  No low flying  clouds.  These clouds where pretty high.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly what appeared to be two shooting stars dropped out of the sky, then quickly made a right angle.  They were moving very quickly one on top of each other and then starting chasing each other in a zigzag pattern as if either fighting or playing.  The most dramatic event was when the one literally reversed and went around and underneath the other; and then they both flew away.  We then woke our other two friends up and at approximately 3am; we then saw a varying times within a 20 minute period; three quick shooting objects of light (almost like shooting stars but they clearly were not).  Just to be clear, we witnessed this sighting completely sober.  We had not been drinking and were clear minded.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I usually see planes that are extremely close, as they are about to land. This was not plane, it wasnt even an aircraft I dont think. As I was driving a swift motion caught my eye and as I turned my head I saw a green ball of light. I cant put into perspective the actual size but I can say it would appear to be that of a basketball perhaps and it has like a green motion trail following it. As soon as I could get the words &#34; What in the world&#34; out of my mouth it dissapeared seemingly into thin air as if it evaporated. I can remember that it was as close as the top of a tree though and about several house lengths away from me. I just found this site. I wish I could of been more help earlier.

It appeared as if 2 sets of lights one on top of the other, the light/ object moved to the right and then quickly back to the left and then again to the right. The light faded on one side and then completely disappeared. The sky was partly cloudy and the movement appeared as if behind a cloud part of the time, but you could still see the bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object appeared metallic in nature.  It could only be seen as it turned, otherwise it was not visible to the naked eye.  Possibly due to sunlight reflecting off craft.  Object appeared thin, with a noticeable triangular shape.  It moved at a high rate of speed, changing directions often.  There were four other people in the vehicle.  I was the driver and the only one who was able to identify it.  No one else saw the object although it was discussed. My background includes a bachelors and master&#39;s degree.

I watched it as I walked. It very very slowly descended directly downward for a long time. I assumed it was something falling from space. Then, when it looked like it was just about to reach the top of the mountain, a smaller light fell or was dropped and took a few minutes to fall onto the mountain and disappear. The light then began to rise in a diagonal straight line heading southward at a noticeably faster speed than before for about five, or at most, 10 minutes. It flashed and disappeared just before crossing paths with a commercial airplane headed West. (It looked nothing like the airplane.) I had seen a similar light in the same area a few days ago, but it had just hovered there. I had thought it was some sort of astronomical body, a star or planet maybe.

It was possibly the length of a large jet (747)and seemed to be about as wide as the freeway lanes.  The flashing red light was in the middle of the bottom of the craft. There were bright white lights across the end and what appeared to be lighted windows along the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The traffic light changed almost immediately and I drove under the freeway, looking up and observing the bottom of the craft.

I pulled into a parking lot on the beach to observe them to see what they were or if they were moving. I sat in my car for around 45 minutes listening to music and keeping an eye on the lights. They did not move. I proceeded home and was able to see them from my home until daylight a few hours later. I asked around about it and someone claimed to have seen the same light formation at 9 pm the same night. I attempted to take a photograph with my cell phone but there wasn&#39;t sufficient lighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One comet was larger than the other with the smaller one slightly lower; it’s head almost even with the tail of the larger comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two comets that night tracked near the same latitude line as the crescent moon tracked just slightly lower in the sky, at least 3 hand widths behind the moon and sunward toward the Southeastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both comets were very close to one another separated by a pencil thickness; both tails about ¾ to ½ the length and as bright as the moon until clouds from a cold front moved into the area as I neared Tampa covering both comets and moon around 6:30 am. The comet heads were pointed upward toward the zenith not sunward as I have observed comets in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/1/08 01:30|Port Neches|TX|Cigar|5 minutes|A single neon-blue, glowing, pill-shaped object, suspended in air, then shot (not dropped) downward out of sight.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78218.html|370|ndxe200802| A single neon-blue, glowing, pill-shaped object, suspended in air, then shot (not dropped) downward out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Blue, Glowing, Pill Shaped UFO  First, let me state that I have lived in the Gulf Coast region of Texas my entire life. The area is littered with refineries, but I know what refinery lights are and any other potential anomaly that they might affect. What I saw had nothing to do with anything related to the refineries of Southeast Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in the winter of 2007 or 2008, I took my three dogs out for the last time before going to bed. At the time, I lived in a townhouse.  There were only eleven townhouses, all in a row.  The fronts of the houses faced a two-lane road, and across that, a grass field about two hundred yards long.  Past the field, another two lane road, then a small refinery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I take the dogs out, I go through the back of the town house, out the garage, and into a small field behind the townhouses.  Before even taking the dogs out, I felt nervous for no apparent reason. When I opened my garage, the nervousness turned into more of an anxious fear that grew worse.  At this time, I couldn’t see anything, but my skin tingled.  As I could see no reason for my trepidation, I continued walking my dogs down the small drive behind the set of garages.  The small dogs didn’t notice anything or act strange as far as I can remember.  But for some reason, this one time and only this time, I wanted to go back inside.  I was afraid for my dogs even. I didn’t want to be out there. I was afraid of something before I even saw anything.  And when I thought back on the incident, this fear gave credibility to what I saw afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When standing behind the townhouses, obviously the field or refineries that can be seen from the front are out of sight. The night was clear, no cloud-cover. I could only see over the roofline from the field behind the townhouses. There was a vertical, pill shaped object sitting in the sky. I say sitting because it wasn’t making any noise, wasn’t moving at all. The object must have been large, but I couldn’t give a detailed size because I didn’t have a frame of reference to measure the distance. Like I said, I was looking over a roofline. I thought it must have been sitting somewhere over the refinery or in front or behind it. This gives a lot of leeway as to distance, so the size still baffles me. I can describe, however, that at the distance it sat from me, it looked about five inches vertical and about two inches horizontal (height and width). But without a distance I can’t discern size. I can say it &#34;felt&#34; large, but it didn’t move at all and made absolutely no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object glowed neon-blue, the whole thing. I didn’t notice any other color lights on it. It was just one bright blue glow. I only observed it for about five to ten seconds. It was not going up or down or away or closer to me. And then, suddenly, and I mean fast, the thing just shot straight down behind the roofline. It didn’t &#34;drop&#34; like an object that would shoot straight up into the air, sit, and then fall back down to earth. It moved almost instantaneously. But I couldn’t see why it would shoot towards the ground. But again, I couldn’t see the ground below it because of my vantage point behind the townhouses. So after it disappeared below the roofline, anything else on my part would be conjecture. I did have an instant moment of panic like maybe it was coming for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not afraid of much in life, but I felt an intense fear. I made my dogs get inside. I looked out the front door window to see what I could see, nothing. I locked the doors and sat on my couch in silence with a revolver. I guess I was afraid that it saw me; that’s what it felt like. It saw me watching it, then left. I know it sounds silly and childish, but I thought it might &#34;take out the witness&#34; or something like that. Again odd, ...when I was watching it outside, it felt like an actual presence. Like it could see or was watching something. But that might’ve just been the fear. I still can’t figure out why I was afraid even before I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told everyone close to me, and they all believed it. I’m not a person to make something like that up, never before or since. The whole incident is a mystery I can’t solve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Signed,  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

ONE IN THE FRONT AND ONE IN THE BACK.(I DONT KNOW IF THEY SAW IT TOO, I ASSUME THEY DID BECAUSE IT WAS VERY NOTICIABLE) WE WERE GOING NORTH AND ON OUR EAST SIDE MAYBE 1/8 OF A MILE AWAY WERE THE TREES WERE WE SAW JUST ABOVE THE TREES 3 BRIGHT LIGHTS THAT WERE LIKE RED AND BLUE IN A TRIANGLE FORM KIND OF SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER. THEY WERE MOVING IN LIKE A CIRCLE MOTION AND HEADING NORTH LIKE WE WERE, AND SUDDENLY 2 OF THEM GOT REAL CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AND THATS WHEN WE RELIAZED THAT IT WASNT AN AIRPLANE OR A HELICOPTER BECAUSE THEY BOTH MADE CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER. THEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN THE 2 LIGHTS JUST TOOK OFF AT AN INCREDIBLE SPEED AND LOOKED LIKE 2 MORE BRIGHT STARS IN THE SKY. THE OTHER LIGHT JUST STAY AROUND THE AREA FOR A FEW MORE MINUTES AND THEN WE SAW IT TAKE OFF IN THE SAME WAY. FOR SOME WEIRD REASON WE SAW ANOTHER BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WAS KIND OF RED BETWEEN THE TREES ON THE FLOOR AND WE DONT KNOW IF IT IS INVOLVED WITH THIS.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
