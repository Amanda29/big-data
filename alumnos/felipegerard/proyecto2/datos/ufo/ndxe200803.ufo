I had left a softball game in Davie, FL to return to my home to Naples, FL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling westbound to Naples, FL on Interstate 75, otherwise known as Alligator Alley, as I neared exit 49, I thought I was seeing an airplane traveling at a very low altitude. I noticed lights in the sky just beyond the overpass, when I came to the other side of the overpass; I realized that this was not any airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw an object with four bluish lights on four corners, like the shape of a square or a cross. Since it was dark, I did not see the exact shape. The object was about 300 - 400 feet above the ground and it did not travel at the speed of an airplane, instead it hovered over a certain area. It caught my attention because it hardly moved. I drove directly underneath the object. It covered the two westbound lanes of the highway and half of the median. I continued on and did not stop because I got scared. I looked at my car radio and it was exactly 11:50 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was not anything I have ever seen. I am very confident that I seen a UFO. I wonder if anyone else seen what I did because I was not the only one traveling on that road that night.<n>

There were no coloured flashing lights (as on a plane) &amp; it seemed to be moving too fast for either a satellite or a plane;  it was nowhere near the normal flight path to the airport. As far as I can judge, it was very high in the sky.  I glanced back to the moon, &amp; was surprised to see another, slightly smaller &amp; fainter light, following the first one at about an arms-length behind.  I watched for about 30 seconds until the first one was too faint to be seen clearly &amp;  continued on my way.  I feel there here was something strange about these lights; no noise, no coloured lights, and oddly fast. My location is Cape Town, South Africa &amp; the sun rises at about 7am so it was still pitch dark; the lights were headed to right of the faint glow of the rising sun--it is obscured by mountains until much later. Unfortunately, I do not have sufficient knowledge to give more exact directions.<n>

There is an air force and army base about 15 miles from here.  March 31 at about midnight I went out to have a cigarette.  About a minute after I got outside I looked over the horizon.  There was a light with an odd haze/glow moving around just above the tree line.  I decided it was an airplane until I noticed that the light stayed there for a second, zig-zaged around, and then shot down under the trees.  The light then came back up to a higher area and repeated the same movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I realized it was definitely not and airplane that I knew of.  The object continued this for quite some time, at least 20 min, and then disappeared.  It took place above the north horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Upon examination of other aircraft flying in the area I could see that this was much too high to be a light on top of any pole.  What was floating was about three times as high as any other aircraft in the sky was and about three times as bright as anything else in the sky also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my boyfriend look at the object.  He agreed that it was unlike anything else in the sky (and he wants to be a pilot so trust me he knows what should be in the sky).  It did not twinkle like stars nor did it move like a plane, and again because of its position in the sky and the area we live in we knew that there are absolutely no polls around that are that high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon us moving closer in the direction of the light it actually began to descend if you will.  While not moving forward or backwards it was dropping altitude.  Once it was just above tree level (below all other aircraft in the sky) it began moving forward (we were heading east on the highway so forward for the craft was southwest).  As it went over our truck (which had a sun roof so we were literally right under it!!!) we noticed what appeared to be a triangular shape with lights along the outer back points of the triangle (on the sides and bottom).  These lights on the wings (if we can call them that because they were attached to the body and not like airplane wings) flashed on both sides at the same time.  They were a band of lights that flashed simultaneously on both sides alternating red and the blue/green color from front to back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also on the underside, located where a cabin might be for someone to fly the craft or the landing gear might be was three circular lights, like spot lights, that were giving off the glow.  There was absolutely no light coming from inside the craft.  These lights would have been in the way of any landing gear, so we could not understand how this craft could be a plane and land.  These lights were pointing down at the ground! Not in the direction the craft was going!! There was absolutely no directional light!! The lights were allowing the craft to see the ground perfectly but did not emit a beam glow down towards the ground but rather a glow around the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the object did start to move and travel over our vehicle, it moved at a steady  pace, yet quick enough to remain uncatchable by our vehicle upon turning around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 24 year old property tax consultant and my boyfriend is a 22 year old aspiring pilot.  In our free time we like to observe the stars and planets as well as go to the local airports to watch plane come and go all day.  We are not two people who would call just anything in the sky a UFO.  This was honestly a craft that almost appeared to be like a delta yet far superior to any delta ever seen by either one of us and that apparently had no landing gear due to the placement of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw something and pointed it out to who I was with and quickly realized that it wasnt a shooting star at all it was something else. I saw this object moving across the sky rather quickly and it seemed to be low and large. There were three circles in a line, but it appeared to just all be one object. The circles had an orange aura around them. They were all moving at the same speed, the objected seemed to wobble a bit before I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The 2 lights were moving in perfect syncronisation heading west until one stopped, while the other continually moved west at very high speed. Speed basis compared to aircraft flying at 37,000ft i would estimate 3 to 4 times that speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the Lights for approx 10 minutes and in that time although the one that was moving was farther away it still appeared as bright as it was when i first saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second light remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Walking in dark area of west eugene this night. Sun had set but horizon to east still some green and blue. I noticed a very bright high altitude object that looked to be a satallite at first, however, much brighter than I have seen satillites before and moving slower. I still thought nothing of it but watched it for the beauty of it. It then slowed in the sky and made a turn to the northeast. This caused me to give more attention. After about 10 secs more I noticed another smaller object following it at some distance. The smaller object tunrned to follow the same trajectory as the very bright object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ive seen many satillites in my life and even saw the emrgency space shuttle re-entry landing that took place in California years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> all I can say is that this was somewhat unusual due to size and 2 ufos with direction change. I have never reported any sighting before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

Witnessed by my daughter and I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12/23/2008   I&#39;m sorry it  took long to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say this happened early  2008 around the afternoon hours. I just happen to find this site while watching a  National Geographic channel on UFO sightings. It was being narrated by the late Peter Jennings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a 15 story building in which I&#39;m located on the 5th floor. We happen to have a great view of the New York City skyline. This was an overcast day but the view was clear for miles. One could see the skyline quite clearly from where we are; some 5-10 miles from the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter, who was playing with her dolls near by yelled out to me to look out the window. I in the mean time was on the computer finishing up some papers, when I turn to look out and we see this oblong shaped object some 3-4 miles away. It&#39;s difficult to discern exactly the distance because all this lasted some 15-20 seconds. But as we looked outside, this object floated some 600 feet/plus from the ground, just  hovering when it began to move upward slowly and then disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was obelisk with some sort of protrusions sticking out from the side in a horizontal  form.  It was dark black.  I would guess the object was rather large. Roughly  some 70-100 feet long vertically. It made no sound. Wasn&#39;t a helicopter, or  blimp that just happened to stand on it&#39;s end. It was very weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is something I will never forget. The odd thing of course is that no one that I know or I don&#39;t know reported this except my daughter and myself. My daughter is 5 years old.  This is a big city and for this  to happen here is just damn crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I looked up and saw a cone shape object, with one blinking light. It had turn just slighty as it were silver in color (chrome). A friend had been there at the time, I asked him to look at the object, and it was gone as if it was never there. It was a matter of a second or two. I don&#39;t know of anything that could disappear so quickly?<n>

The light was a low intensity, translucent, white to very light blue in color, and oblong in shape. The size was similar to that of a beach ball, maybe a little bigger. The light rapidly moved north at my guess of 100+mph perpendicular to the outside shoulder of the northbound lanes; its altitude was approximately 30’ above the ground. I saw no object related to the light, but the light seemed to pulse/flash at every length of its width in travel, a very rapid pulse considering the speed that I surmised. I tried to keep view of the object, but travelling at 60mph myself and crossing a lane inadvertently to view it (then trying to regain my control of my vehicle) I lost sight of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sky was clear, the weather was chilly and slightly breezy.  There were no storm/rain clould in sight.  Directly in front of us in the sky about 45 - 55 degrees above the horizon, we noticed a very bright object moving toward the earth and incredible speed.  It was glowing with a yellowish hue, had no tail or coma.  It seemed to move toward the ground but we didn&#39;t see it go behind the tree line it just simply disappeared.  This was no aircraft I have ever seen, or my friend (who was driving btw).  I have seen meteors, comets, planets, and other celestial objects...this was neither of these.  Although it was only a few seconds in duration, I could tell immediately that it was out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw what I thought at first, a large white landing light approach from the south, near the town of Millersville. I estimate it was about 5 miles to my south when first viewed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was this aircraft was unusually low, as the local airport is approx. 8 miles to my north.  The white light was moving slowly about 1000’ AGL and had no accompanying red or white upper or lower strobes, had a bright warm white glow; and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the large white light continue north towards me for approx. 10 seconds, I detected some faint green lights on the upper portion of the object.  At this point, the light slowed and moved SIDEWAYS to the west.  The white light continued facing to the north during the initial move.  The object was partially blocked from my view by a group of pine trees as it headed west.  After the object came back into full view it changed into a group of three inverted V’s, forming a pyramid/triangle shape.  It continued west for approx. five miles.  The inverted V’s were a mix of pale green and bright red lighting, similar to faint LED’s, not a bright aircraft position or strobe light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object made the turn from north to west, I could hear a deep sound similar to air rushing through turbines.  That was the only time I heard any sound from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object again turned north towards a tall cell tower with bright white strobe on top, near the town of Mountville.  It flew past the cell tower and it’s lighting on the three inverted V’s changed to a bright pulsing red. It appeared the pulsing on the object picked up the strobe flash interval on the cell tower. The object continued to the north-northwest in the (3) inverted V shape and passed behind some distant buildings and out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Disclaimer:  I am a Military pilot (fulltime) and am familiar with aircraft lighting and flight paths.  I’ve lived at my present location for over 15 years and am familiar with the day to day flight paths of commuter aircraft and the occasional corporate or medevac helo over my location and this sighting was definitely not normal and &#34;shook me up&#34; to the point I felt it necessary to file a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered calling the local ATC Approach control after the sighting to see if any pilots had reported similar sightings but my wife talked my out of it.<n>

But then again, this is a very small town and people tend to be very unconcerned here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little before 11pm, an extremely bizarre series of noises awoke me and my husband.  It was a very loud series of booms or clangs along with a very loud hissing or static noise.  The booms were about 1-3 seconds apart and were random.  The &#34;hissing&#34; noise was consistent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise was coming from the sky and we determined it was moving.  The first few minutes very loud and it got progressively quieter.   No car stereo could possibly muster that much volume and it really sounded it was coming from above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, we live ½ mile from a race track and small airport and I’m from a large city.  I’ve heard a lot of noise in my life but NOTHING REMOTELY LIKE THIS.  It was way louder than the nearby racetrack or airport ever was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so loud and disconcerting we were watching the news because we thought something crazy happened but nothing.  Again, it’s very bizarre.  I wouldn’t know what to make out of this.  My husband half-jokingly said it could be one of those military aircrafts but what would they be doing flying over a small town like this?  Neither of us could remotely recognize either the clanging/booming nor the air pressure-like hissing to anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.  The police did say there was a boat show but that’s at least 20 minutes away.  We’ve heard fire works go off (the big ones) and this was nothing like it.  Again, the booms were a little random but where going off in a pattern for about 3-4 minutes straight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somebody else must’ve heard this!<n>

The witness was found to possess a broad scientific background, well educated and well spoken. PW holds USAF certifications that would probably equal an Associates Degree in Electronics (radio, navigation, and radar), as well as aviation training to pilot a Cessna aircraft. Additional advanced education includes a BS in Biochemistry from Purdue and a Masters in Business, also from Purdue. He is presently retired from the largest computer firm in the world, and indicates travel to more than 40 countries during his active career. His wife of many years is still actively engaged in the business world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These investigators found that the described event (as well as two previous encounters with unknown objects) had greatly affected the PW. He had become HIGHLY motivated to seek answers to what was observed, and began a vigorous pursuit of various areas of research immediately after 29March08. (Note-The PW has now obtained his MUFON FI&#39;s credentials and has become a valuable asset in MUFONGA operations in the area of Cobb County Georgia).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness recounted the facts he described in his CMS report and different areas were refined by these FIs with additional questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PW said that upon first observation of the lights at about 10:30PM, it was as if he was observing a &#39;descent&#39;. As the event unfolded, he attempted to see beyond the lighting configuration to get the details of exactly what was over his property, but was unable to determine any actual structural detail due to the darkness and obvious dark coloration of the object itself. Gathered from this interview, it is obvious the PW seemed to have had a certain &#39;calling&#39; as FI Bass describes it. A &#39;calling&#39; to go out and check his mail, then something that drew his attention to the sky and the subsequent observations and hearing of the described low &#39;winding down&#39;, jet engine-like sound. During said observations, the PW was himself mystified by his conduct and other side issues........that the tree branches overhead in the location to which he had rushed should have been noticeable during the event, but it was if he was looking up with no branches in evidence. Thereafter he lost interest, as if it &#39;was over&#39; and the lights/object began to move away, but he then became, and remains, extremely motivated to delve into this and other such mysteries. (See witness account field). PW said he determined there was no missing time related to the occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While some might not understand the &#39;unusual&#39; feelings attributed to this matter, this writer (Sheets) has experienced the exact same conditions prior to a surprise observation of a major unknown aerial event. In 1997, the writer was investigating two substantial cases; one in Lagrange Georgia within Georgia&#39;s infamous &#39;Troup-Heard UFO Corridor&#39;; and in south Georgia, a series of night reports from law enforcement officials in Jeff Davis County. The Lagrange investigation was arranged for a certain day, and upon grabbing my FI&#39;s kit and walking out the door, the writer felt a certain &#39;calling&#39; (a VERY strong urge) to INSTANTLY and INEXPLICABLY change plans and drive 150+ miles to Jeff Davis County and work on those cases, which had actually been scheduled for the NEXT WEEK. A tense, expectant sensation pervaded the whole drive down to south Georgia........said feelings and sensations ENDING immediately after observation of a dramatic, unknown, night-time aerial display in the area of Jeff Davis County (as if &#34;well, it&#39;s over, that&#39;s it&#34;). Thus, a better understanding of the feelings and motivations of the PW. After reviewing all of the circumstances involved in this case, there seems to be some sort of unknown influence at work in this matter. Is this witness, as well as others, more sensitive or more attuned to anomalies in our environment? I would say yes. Do some true &#39;unknowns&#39;, perhaps controlled or generated by an unseen intelligence, project some sort of subtle communication that can be perceived by such sensitive individuals as our PW, or perceived by others known to this writer both within and without MUFON, and perceived by the writer himself? I would say yes. Do some unknown objects project an unusual &#39;zone&#39; as they hover or move........a zone created by electromagnetic fields, ionization, propulsion, or some other mechanism......giving effects that can influence those nearby? Again I would say yes. In past years, this FI has encountered other case witnesses who have reacted in a similar way, ! some eve ntually joining MUFON and making valuable contributions to our effort, and others not joining the chapter, but remaining &#39;friends&#39; of MUFON for many years. Finally, might some form of &#39;telepathy&#39; also be involved in such cases?  Perhaps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 20May08, photographs and an event-scene diagram were made, and FI Steve Bass conducted an in-depth interview with the second (separated) witness in this case at his residence across the street from the PW&#39;s home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From FI Bass&#39; field notes and interview:  The second witness (W2) was found to be the mature male homeowner across the street from PW. He is a former aircraft mechanic for defense contractor Lockheed of Marietta, and also a former Lockheed buyer who is ten credit hours away from his Masters in Accounting. In addition to this interview, W2 also provided a sketch of what he observed on the night of 29March08, superimposed onto a printed blow-up photo of PW&#39;s home and property. (See photo and sketch). This witness indicates in margin notes on his sketch that he is familiar (due to his past occupation) with the C-5, C-141, C-130, F-16, F-22, DC-9 and other aircraft which fly out of nearby Dobbins ARB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> W2 stated that it was a quiet night in the neighborhood with no one out and about, little traffic, no barking dogs. He stepped outside of his garage to smoke a cigarette between 9 and 10:00PM. He then looked to the east, then ESE, and observed the object in the sky blocking his vision across the street, flying slow and low, right to left, and was about 30 degrees off of the horizon, perhaps about 500 to 1000 feet above ground level. He heard no noise nor saw any lights, and indicated the duration was about 10-20 seconds. Moving at very slow speed, it disappeared to the north, finally about 10-20 degrees above the horizon of the adjacent National Forest. He is of the opinion that it looked brown to him, and as it moved off he got his only look at a more distinct outline, the portion he saw looking like a &#39;submarine&#39;. W2 said he was surprised and excited and considered calling his neighbor (the PW) but did not, feeling he might already be in bed (he did not know at the time that his neighbor, the PW, had been outside and also made the observation, although from a different angle). An additional conundrum involving W2 is the fact that he was outside in order to smoke a cigarette. FI Bass determined that W2 &#39;lit-up&#39; IMMEDIATELY prior to seeing the object, Bass then inquiring where he was on the cigarette when the object had disappeared. W2 replied that he had finished it, which would have taken at least 5 minutes, 10 minutes max..........however W2&#39;s event duration was described as being 10-20 seconds. Is W2 just mistaken about the cigarette time sequence? Was some sort of time distortion in play i.e. the close proximity of the object projecting an influence over W2? Is this an example of missing time? This matter was not resolved........there were just no firm conclusions in this cigarette vs. time issue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FI Bass continued his commentary regarding W2.....throughout the interview, W2 was relaxed and nonchalant and did not go for a &#39;more amazing story&#39;. He sometimes searched for the correct words, speaking slowly, and did not appear confused nor did he go on tangents while talking i.e. staying on the subject at hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted here that W2 has been diagnosed with brain cancer, but it seemed not to have been at the stage that affected his thinking or perception very much, if at all. Upon the FIs arrival on 20May08, he was busily at work in his garage tinkering with a lawn mower on his shop bench, and thereafter conversed well with these FIs prior to his official statement to FI Bass. FI Bass&#39; comments regarding the witness are to the effect that this condition &#34;seems to mildly affect concentration&#34;, but W2 is still &#34;articulate, intelligent, easily understood, relaxed demeanor, humorous and matter-of-fact&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is obvious to these investigators that from the credibility of the two separated witnesses and all of their supportive documents and sketches, and from our investigative findings, that an object from unknown origins overflew low and slow the Marietta Georgia property of the PW on 29March08 at about 10:30PM. Said object was MASSIVE in size, with the PRECISE shape undetermined due to darkness but believed to be rectangular, and containing an array of lights as described and obviously making the bizarre low sound as heard by the PW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the PW and W2 sketches, photographs made on-site, and other diagrams, this writer feels that while the PRECISE shape is unknown, the size of this massive object might be as large as a football field 300&#39;x160&#39;. Though from W2&#39;s description of it flying away and presenting a &#34;submarine&#34; like appearance, it indeed could have been a geometric shape or a rectangle as seen in profile. Again, it was dark and the objects surface was also dark except for the lights observed by the PW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: This event occurred about four (4) miles WNW of Dobbins Air Reserve Base, which also houses the defense contractor offices and factory of Lockheed-Martin. (The home of the PW is in a direct line almost exactly four miles WNW of the westerly end of the Dobbins main runway). Both the military and Lockheed utilize the common air facility. In recent months, MUFONGA has received some additional unsubstantiated information about &#39;unusual&#39; aerial sightings in that vicinity. FI Bass, with knowledge gained from his aviation work and a review of certain public resources related to this facility, found some possible unusual features within the said compound. It has been found that the Lockheed portion of the compound is PARTICULARLY tight in it&#39;s security, which is as it should be for a defense contractor. However these other factors causes one to wonder exactly how forthright is the official response when we seek information regarding things occurring on the doorstep of Dobbins ARB and environs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> BGE; Information Quality 100%=1; Reliability 74%=0.74; Strangeness 14.286%=0.14286; Certainty Index 10.58%=0.1058.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to these aforementioned factors, this case is classified as an &#39;Unknown-UAV&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many photos, diagrams, sketches, maps and other official documents were generated by this investigation, too numerous for posting on CMS.

Before the lights disappeared in the distance, they had &#34;chased&#34; each other rapidly in a small circle. The entire &#34;performance&#34; resembled a bravado-fuelled airshow, with rapid manoeuvres and (nearly?) silent engines. The event lasted 4 or 5 seconds during which the objects traversed one-third of the sky. Although there were brief and faint sounds (a vibrating rumble and a wooshing noise) associated with the phenomenon, they may have been coincidental.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Full Description  After shopping at Wal-mart, I was walking through the Argyle Mall parking lot when a movement in the clear night sky induced me to look up. West of where I stood, some 50 degrees up in the sky, I saw two steady (non-flashing) orangish-white lights (the size of an average star, but noticeably dimmer) in proximity to each other, moving fast in formation in the southwesterly direction. I assumed this was an airliner with lights on both ends of its wings. The &#34;aircraft&#34; appeared to be flying very low, because the lights were moving very fast and the distance between them was rather large. (If I extended my arm, the length of my index finger would approximate the apparent distance between the lights. For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;d speculate that the altitude couldn&#39;t have been higher than 3,000 ft.)  When the lights simultaneously veered away from each other in symmetrical arcs, it became obvious that they were two separate objects that had been moving in formation. The objects then performed some playful airshow-style acrobatics (lots of rapid turns in different directions) at high speeds, all the while continuing in the southwesterly direction. Before they disappeared in the distance, the lights had performed a spectacular manoeuvre: for at least one second they were &#34;chasing&#34; each other in a small circle (perhaps 5 degrees in diameter), as if they were attached to the blades of a rotating propeller. The revolution was so rapid (at least two rotations per second) that it drew a distinct circle of light against the night sky. (It&#39;s possible that what looked like circular motions from a distance were actually coordinated corkscrew motions along the axis of the southwesterly trajectory the lights were following.) The entire experience lasted only 4 to 5 seconds, during which the objects managed to traverse at least one-third of the sky (this indicates considerable speed). Although there were other people nearby at the time, I doubt anyone else noticed this brief and low-key phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What struck me about the quality of the motion of the objects was the speed and peculiar fluidity and smoothness with which they changed directions. The thought that came to my mind was: they behave like living creatures, not aircrafts -- the motion somehow reminded me of bats in flight or fish swimming in water. The final circular manoeuvre brought to mind mosquitoes or flies swarming around. I&#39;ve never seen airplanes performing such swift and tight acrobatics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I detected some strange faint sounds coinciding with the sighting, I can&#39;t be sure they were emitted by the objects, as opposed to, say, cars. When I first noticed the lights, I heard a brief (one second) and low, vibrating rumble, and then, a few seconds later, as the objects were moving further away, a brief (less than two seconds), soft wooshing sound. I&#39;m positive I heard no ordinary aircraft noises from propeller or jet engines. (The event took place after 10 PM when traffic noise in the area was at low intensity -- it shouldn&#39;t have drowned down the sound of planes flying so low.) The absence of normal aircraft sounds seems inconsistent with the most likely mundane explanation of my experience -- that the lights marked low-flying (and improperly lit) fighter jets on a night mission. Had the objects been such aircrafts, they should have produced audible and unmistakeable jet-engine drones. (I&#39;m not aware of an acoustic stealth technology that&#39;s this effective.)  It may be relevant to note, however, that the Argyle Mall parking lot, where I had the sighting, is located only 3 km southwest from the London (Ontario) International Airport, and that, assuming they&#39;d been following a roughly straight path even before I noticed them, the objects were coming from the general direction of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was with a friend; we were taking pictures of the stars on a tripod.  My friend was looking through the viewfinder in one direction over my house; I was looking out into the sky overlooking the Santa Clarita Valley and saw a ridiculously fast object slide through the sky at a lightning fast speed.  The object was about 10,000 feet in the sky and was dark in color.  The object had no lights on it or coming from it.  The object flew straight from right to left and did not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I saw the object, immediately yelled to my friend and by the time he looked over at my direction in was gone. The object appeared to be moving through the sky as if it did not want to be noticed disappearing into dark grey sky to my left.  I was only able to see the object because I happened to be looking at that spot at the exact time it was moving through that area slightly lit by the city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen an aircraft move as fast as this one did, it took a while for my brain to actually comprehend what it was I had just seen. I’m still having a hard time accepting what I saw, I have never seen anything like this.<n>

When I seen this particular bright white orb moving from west to east.  I thought it was a plane at first because of it slow speed, until I noticed it was following a smaller white orb barely visible. I ran inside to get my 8mm camcorder, and filmed it just over my house.  I am currently trying to figure out how to get it off 8mm and on too my computer so I can submit it.  Upon review of the tape, towards the end of the film the smaller craft, takes off at a right angle and disappears.  I did not see this with my bare eyes. Then something else shoots from left to right of the screen next from the bigger bright orb. I could not identify what it was.  I stopped filming when I went to move through my house to my back porch, so I turned off my camera cause I did not want to film the inside of my house.  When I got to the back porch I lost track of it (big orb). There was no point to continue filming.<n>

The sky was black and the object was black so it was difficult to see exactly how large it was, but the part of the object that I did see, was approx. 3 times larger than the house that it hovered over. The house is a basic one floor single family unit. I did see that the object was black, but I could not make out the exact shape of the object. (I’m positive it was ‘cloaked’ in some way. The object also had 2 white lights on its front side. They were spaced out, spanning the approx. size of the house under it. I don’t think they spanned to the exact sides of the craft. They were closer together than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stepped outside of the door and noticed the object, it seemed to have noticed me at the same time. It began moving very slowly over to my house (in my estimation, approx. 2 miles per hour).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I ran back into my house. It felt as though it had targeted me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As, I walked through my kitchen, I saw the object over my yard, and moving to the top of my house. Again, it was moving very slowly, as if it were in a ‘hovering movement state’. I then watched it move from the side of my house to the top of my house. I could not longer see it at that point, as it was on top of my house. Again, it hovered not more than 20 feet above my house. Perhaps it hovered even lower than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then, that I ran into my son’s room and told him about it. He wanted to go look at it and would have seen it, but I was afraid that it was coming to my house because it possibly had the intentions of abducting a human (and there we were.. ), so I wouldn’t allow my son to go out to look at it, for fear that he would be abducted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hid for about 30 minutes... then I felt ok again. I went to bed. Approx. 30 minutes after I got into bed, I saw the UFO once again (out of my bedroom window, to the south). This time it was rapidly flying away from my neighborhood. It was flying south (towards Tacoma). I could not determine its size. But I did see all of its lights. I will try to draw the pattern below:   					*   			*				*   		*			*			*   			*				*   					*  The lights were pulsing brightly at approx. 5 second intervals. When they pulsed brightly, they actually became almost one light and I had to close my eyes as a result of the brightness. Mind you, the object was approx. 1 to 2 miles away at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object fly over and up (to an area of the sky) where there was a round white light enshrouded by a thick black cloud (the cloud receded occasionally, in the same manner that clouds recede and thicken). When the cloud receded I could see that the white light looked exactly like the moon. Mind you, this was approx. 6 or 6:15 AM. The moon does not shine outside of my bedroom window at that time of the morning. (I am absolutely positive, as I watch it constantly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object that I was watching seemed to fly up to the cloud where the &#34;moon&#34; was residing  This is when the object disappeared. The ‘moon’ went behind the black cloud. It stayed dark for at least 10 minutes and I didn’t watch to see if it showed up again after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curiously, I have been seeing this ‘moon’ at odd times (2am, 3am) during the night for the past week or so. I don’t know if it has anything to do with the object that I saw, but it was a very odd sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a true report. I am a professional. I have worked IT for the past 15 years and before that I was the Director of a HUD program for 10 years.<n>

At the same time, the &#34;talking&#34; was like a bubbling sound that would change in frequency and pitch.  At times, it would sound excited and &#34;talk&#34; faster.  This was always with the metal-on-contret noise.  It would go away and then come back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, I went outside and sat in a porch swing in the dark.  There is a mobile home park across the street from me and one home had some lights on.  I saw a dark, low-flying form pass the lighted windows at a fast rate.  Then I heard the sounds from inside the mobile home park and dogs started barking.  At this point, I thought, &#34;What am I doing outside?&#34;  I went back inside.  I kept hearing the noise off and on until dawn started to break.  Very creepy and very hard to describe.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/28/08 00:05|Las Cruces|NM|Light|10 minutes|Two unexplainable lights over  the southern horizon near Las Cruces, New Mexico.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62388.html|37|ndxe200803| Two unexplainable lights over  the southern horizon near Las Cruces, New Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My residence is approximately five miles east of the city of Las Cruces and approximately five miles west of the Organ Mountains, half mile south of highway 70.  It is a routine for me to take my dog out to our backyard, which is on the south side of our home.  From our backyard we have a very open and clear southern view of the horizon.  This particular evening I noticed a light, approximately five to seven degrees above the horizon.  It was straight south, particular to my position.  I noticed as I looked, that it seemed rather bright and flickering like a fireball.  I immediately asked my wife to look with me.  We agreed that it was a light we had never before seen.  As we both looked, the light seemed to get larger and more intense for a couple of minutes.  Then, suddenly, it went dim as if it instantly moved further away.  At this point even I was skeptical, until the light moved to the east briefly, but noticeably and vanished.  As we stood, amazed and shocked, the light reappeared.  This time it appeared slightly more to the west than originally and a couple of degrees lower in the horizon with a slightly more reddish hue.  At this point we asked our cousin to look with us.  The light acted similar to before, getting larger and more intense.  However, it acted differently in the respect that it moved lower in the horizon before it went dim again in the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/27/08 23:40|Yakima|WA|Triangle|10-15 min|Large, low flying triangle shaped aircraft over night skies in Yakima, WA|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62389.html|38|ndxe200803| Large, low flying triangle shaped aircraft over night skies in Yakima, WA. Could well be an experimental aircraft of some kind. This one puzzles me due to the size, low altitude, and the fact that another aircraft (plane/helicopter?) joined it to the southeast (toward Union Gap), where it appeared to stall or hover for a short while (+/- 5 min). Shorty thereafter, it was out of view (by the time I scaled my roof-top).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was letting the dog in around 11:40 PM when I spotted a large (originally thought to be an) aircraft flying directly over Yakima, WA in a S-SE fashion. It was way off any normal flight paths known or typically observed in the area. Not to mention the low altitude, estimated at 4,000-6,000 feet! The craft was extremely loud which obviously points to a plane of some sort. However, when it was directly above my neighborhood (central portion of the city), a strange triangle shape was clearly observed, and the lights were plentiful. Looked like a 747 (on steroids) in the shape of a triangle with blinking lights (white) all over the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was just curious if you received any other reports from the area on this date (evening of 3/27/08)? And if so, what the heck was this Peter? I wasn&#39;t under the impression that Central WA is much of a test area for military aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was one of those beautiful starlit nights that can only be experienced in the mountains.  The moon had not yet risen and the sky was magnificantly clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood looking up at the stars and could see Orion and the Pleiades in the western sky.  I then noticed a very bright white light traveling from west to east directly toward me.  As there were no blinking wing lights I assumed it to be a satellite.  As it came toward me I thought that it was traveling at an uncommonly fast speed for a satellite and seemed to be at a much lower evelation than you would expect a satellite to be.  I then heard the distant sound of a jet and noticed a plane traveling in a NW to SE direction above the western horizon over the mountains.  I looked back up at the light which was almost directly above me and then noticed another plane on the eastern horizon traveling in a NNW direction above the eastern horizon.  Both planes seemed to be at a greater altitude than the light. The bright light came to a stop almost directly above me, made a 90 degree turn to the north and then very rapidly gained altitude, growing smaller and smaller in my vision until it dispeared altogether all in just a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say what this object was.  I can only say that it wasn&#39;t a satellite, it wasn&#39;t an airplane and it behaved in a manner that I never would have believed physically possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In defense of myself,I do not drink and I was not under the influence of any substance that might have influenced my perceptions.  In short I was in total awareness of my surroundings.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/27/08 20:00|Montcalm|WV|Circle|about 3 min.|Aircraft following a possible UFO?|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62449.html|48|ndxe200803| Aircraft following a possible UFO?<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, Im not sure what we saw that night but it had everyone thinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us were boating down the river doing some fishing when I noticed something moving in the sky around the Little Dipper.  It was circular and a bright white color moving from left to right.  As I was looking at this object the other people in the boat noticed it too and one of them made the comment that it was just a plane but it was moving too fast, and there were no other lights, just a solid white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next conclusion was that it could have been a satelite which it could have been, but the speed and the amount of area that it covered as it moved across the sky was amazing. In about a minute or so this object appeared at my far left and streaked across the sky to my far right before we lost it over the mountain. I was in the military and have seen and been around planes, jets, helo&#39;s and I&#39;ve never seen something move this fast, I was astonished. Maybe twenty to thirty seconds after we lost sight of this object, my friend pointed out a group of aircraft behind us. They were in fairly perfect formation with the same lights with a differant aircraft behind them (I say diff. because the lights were diff. on this one) and were moving in the direction of where we last saw the object before it went out of sight over the mountain. In all there were five aircraft, and all seemed to be tailing this object that we saw. We watched for another minute before they too moved across the mountain out of sight. This may not be a ufo sighting but it was too wierd not to report to someone. If anyone else had the same sighting that night, hopefully they report it so that we can find out what it was or wasn&#39;t.<n>

I am a Police Officer at Napa State Hospital and was on duty during this sighting.  On 03-26-08 at 21:07 I was looking west at the constellation Orion and the Pleiades.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed what at first looked like three stars in a triangular formation all moving together.  When I looked closer I could see the lights were on a triangular form that was darker than the sky background.  I watched the object move from south to north at what I approximate as between 500 to 1,000 feet in altitude.  I estimate the object was 20 miles west of me over the Napa / Sonoma County line.  The object seemed to be an equilateral triangle with a steady white light near each corner.  There was also a dimmer white light in the center of the object.  I would estimate that the distance between the outer lights near the corners was slightly less than the distance that separates the stars in Orion’s belt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on these observations and my estimations, the object would have been quite large.  A rough estimate would place the sides of the object at 300 feet in length.  A better extrapolation could be ascertained from my previous estimations though.  The object was moving very swiftly and was completely silent.  I often watch aircraft take off and land at the Napa Airport while working on the west side of our facility in the evenings.  The evening was quiet and I could hear each aircraft as it passes over me, even those at high altitudes.  At the time I saw the object, there were no other aircraft in my field of view.  Additionally, I have some experience flying a Cessna 172 from the Napa Airport when I was taking flying lessons and am familiar with basic avionics and flight characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the distance and altitude I estimate the object was from me, the object appeared to be flying at a rate at least ten times that of the many commercial and private jets I often observe in the air corridors above Napa.  I continued to watch the object as it disappeared behind some trees to the north of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at my watch and marked the time at 21:07 then reached in my pocket for my cell phone.  I was trying to dial my phone by touch so as to preserve my night vision while looking back toward Orion.  As I did this I saw another identical object moving in the same manner as the first.  This was almost one minute from the sighting of the first object.  I continued to watch the object until it disappeared behind the same trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned my observation toward Orion to see if there were any more.  I watched this portion of the sky while glancing at other portions of the sky for another ten minutes before I stopped to call my friend to tell him about the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was in my kitchen when I heard 2 jets fly a little lower than usual so I looked out the window and sure enough I could see the lights of the jets moving North - North West of my house.  I thought it might be another drill or weapons training that takes place often in the west desert in Utah but further watching them I could see that they must have been following something because of some sudden movements they were making which told me this wasnt a drill, nor an exercise.  I continued to watch when I lost track of the 2 jets and could see a red or reddish orange light sitting in the sky.  I thought it might have been a star because it was fairly small but the night was cloudy so that was out of the question.  The light was just sitting there, very still.  It wasn&#39;t growing or shrinking so I knew it wasnt moving towards or away from me, it just stood still.  Then it started to veer south fairly slow and as I could hear a jetcraft in the distance, the light got a little bigger, big enough I could see it changed colors from red to blue and then to yellow.  It started to move a little faster south and started flashing yellow.  I then found the jet moving in from the north behind it and the flashing light dissapeared as the now lone jet moved in a south to south west direction behind my neighbor&#39;s house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were four of us out on the forward portion of the car deck, while most of the rest of the troop was on the back of the deck watching the wake, and the rest were in our bus. I am the Scoutmaster of the troop and have been a Boy Scout leader for years. My son was with me, as were 2 more of my scouts. I was looking towards Hatteras Village, when I saw what appeared to be directly above the village,(Several hundred feet in the air)3 lights blink on, one at a time. They were very brilliant in color, very similar to an orange looking halogen street lamp. There were 3 of them in a line, and there was no sound that I could hear, although we were on the front of a passenger/car ferry. They all faded out one at a time quickly, that&#39;s when I turned and I asked my son and 2 of my scouts if they had seen what I had just seen and they looked up to where I was pointing. That&#39;s when the 3 lights came back on, one at a time and were all in a line. As the light in the rear of the line faded out, another would appear in the front of the line. The lights stayed lit up for approximately 10-15 seconds each time, then they would fade out and appear somewhere else in the line, almost instantly. As we looked at this, I told my son to go get the camera out of the bus, and he ran back to get it. As he was running back to get it, several others on the other side of the front of the ferry were talking about it as well. I never took my eyes off of the lights, and when approximately 45 seconds had elapsed, all of the lights seemed to move quickly to the left, (again all in a line), then seemed to all move in a circular pattern, (once agiain all in unison), and they all faded quickly and did not reappear. We were very baffled by what we saw, and I KNOW WE SAW SOMETHING THAT I CAN&#39;T EXPLAIN.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up the sky since there were few shower clouds earlier. The sky was very clear, only few whispering clouds scattered. I looked up towards the Orion constellation thinking how bright the stars looked tonight, when I noticed a star as bright as Sirius, which was also visible from where I was standing, moving across the sky from the right of Orion on a straight course from S.W. to N.E. As I was trying to focus looking for the blinking lights of the airplanes I noticed it was traveling at least at 30,000 feet altitude without any sound. No blinking lights just a steady bright light, and as it went over a thin cloud it started to fade into a normal size star in the sky. When it came out from over the cloud it kept on getting dimmer although it was closer to my point of view by then. I lost sight of it behind a building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the 3rd incident in the past three months of witnessing an unusual flying object in this area.  My first encounter, however, was in 1971 when I saw a fireball entering the atmosphere and after making a 90 degree turn it split into 4-5 smaller objects that traveled horizontally at a fantastic speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for providing this site for all of us to report what we have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS passed within sight of Athens at 19:30 hrs. on this date, but it would have been to the north of the observer, not in the southern sky.

3/26/08 20:21|Valrico|FL|Light|2 seconds|Pink light does high speed flight from Tampa to Kennedy Space Center 5 minutes before shuttle Endeavor lands.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62398.html|56|ndxe200803| Pink light does high speed flight from Tampa to Kennedy Space Center 5 minutes before shuttle Endeavor lands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter: Since 1984 I have been broadcasting space shuttle launches on a network of radio stations across the country. I have media credentials issued by NASA and am considered an authority on space hardware and systems. The UFO phenomena has always interested me but until 8:21:28 PM,  March 26, 2008, I had never seen one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a whole slew of computers and monitors in my home studio from which I broadcast the launches when I can’t get to the Kennedy Space Center. Upon entry and landing I plot all the trajectories and landing paths. On the 26th of March the shuttle Endeavor was waved off the first landing attempt due to weather conditions being unfavorable. That attempt would have brought the shuttle in over Miami and up the east coast of Florida. The second attempt meant an atmospheric entry interface and landing approach directly over my head in southeastern Hillsborough County (Tampa Bay).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The evening was perfect for satellite watching; the weather was cool and dry and the sky completely clear. I had already plotted the tracks for the ATV and ISS as well as STS-123. The ATV was in the same orbit as the ISS only about 1,200 miles ( 5 minutes) in front it. Having just undocked from the space station, the shuttle was also in the same orbit except about 326 miles (1 minute) behind the ISS. So, orbital mechanics being what they are, there is absolutely no way for the shuttle to ever overtake either the ISS or the ATV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ATV was scheduled to go over my house at 8:20 PM and the ISS at 8:25 PM. The shuttle, which by that time, would have been entering the atmosphere and slowing considerably, would be going over at about 8:33:40 PM on its way to an 8:39 PM landing at the cape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gazing intently at the patch of sky dictated by my computer, we could not see the ATV, it was just too small and dark. At 8:21:28 we noticed a pinkish light moving across the sky. Initially I thought it was the ATV, albeit late.  Then the pink light veered off course and silently zipped in a highly controlled movement across our heads (several neighbors had come out to watch, too) to the southeast and then turned toward the northeast as if headed toward the Kennedy Space Center which is directly across the state from us. It made the trip from right above us to the vicinity of KSC in about 1 to 2 seconds.  I knew then that the object was not the ATV so my thoughts went to the shuttle. Problem being that at the altitude the shuttle flies by the time it gets to Tampa we get twin sonic booms off the nose and tail. This “UFOish” object produced no sonic boom despite the fact that it seemed to have been moving at thousands of miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I was pondering the pink light, the ISS went by overhead at 17,500 mph in its orbit. Very bright but, compared to what I had just seen, laboriously slow. It took the ISS a good 2-3 minutes to move across the sky compared to only a second or two for the pink light. I have never seen anything travel that fast, including supersonic jets at closed to the public media events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back into the house and NASA-TV’s George Diller was saying that the shuttle was “…now just 9 minutes from landing at KSC and about 150 miles off the coast of Florida over the Gulf of Mexico.”  Going back outside, sure enough, right on schedule, I was greeted by the twin sonic booms that must have rattled windows all over the Bay area. The shuttle, however, was too dark to be seen without night vision goggles to pick up the residual heat from its reentry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having watched many launches from my front yard, I have a keen awareness of exactly where the Kennedy Space Center is from my front door… exactly 142.6 miles to the parking lot at the VAB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m not saying it was alien, I don’t know what the little pink light was, but, whatever it was, it was not a plane in the conventional sense of that word. At first I thought its altitude was orbital but as it moved away from the orbit of the ISS, first to the southeast and then curving around to a northeast heading, it didn’t seem to be all that high. If I had to guess I would say maybe about 10,000 to 15,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, that’s about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Enjoy your silo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am very curious about u.f.o.&#39;s so I watch the sky constantly. they are real. it was new years 2008. I watched the sky and I saw an object in the sky that looked like a star(it was brighter). I watched it for about 2 hours. it was stationary most the time but if you watched it closely it moved in circular patterns(also zigzags). that was the yellow one. later on I watched a blue one that pretty much didn&#39;t move. I knew that they were u.f.o.&#39;s at the time. A week later I came    home to Jamestown N.Y. and watched the sky closely. the same objects that I saw down in new orleans seemed to have followed me back. I am assuming that they are different air crafts but they generally look the same. When I go to smoke a cigarette outside of my friends house if someone is walking by I question them. most will say &#34;what the fuck is that&#34; I agree. I know satellited move across the atmosphere   and this craft has been in the air for about 3 months.

We live in Wolfforth, Texas, which is just South of Lubbock, Texas,  Lubbock County.   On Tuesday March 25, 2008 at 9:50 pm  We were sitting in our living room when I saw very bright lights through our living room window.   I watched it for a while thinking that it was an airplane but it was moving too slowly.  I went to the window to see it more closely.  It was moving southeast over Wolfforth, but not in a straight line.  It was dark and I could not see anything but the brilliant white lights on it.  It had several clusters of brilliant white lights.  I called my husband to come look at it.  He looked at it and said that it looked like a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 2 miles away and somewhat low to the ground.  After opening the window and listening, we realized there was no sound coming from it; No motor noise noted.  It moved slowly from Northwest to Southeast and then just vanished.  Total time that we watched it was approximately 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe that it was an airplaine because it was flying too slowely and too close to the ground.  It did not fly in a straight line.  There was no noise from any type of engine.  It was silent. The lights were brilliant white lights-not like those on an airplaine.  It was very large.  I asked my husband if he thought it could be a hot air balloon of some sort and he did not think so because it was much larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be seemingly quite credible.

I observed a craft heading south-easterly, which had just passed over my house when I came outside.  The craft had (5) distinct lights and appeared to be like (2) boomerangs joined (facing one another by the points) in the middle.  The “middle”, where the craft(s) were joined had one large red light.  The “tips” of the boomerangs had white lights.  Their was no contrail.  At first, I did not believe this to be (2) separate crafts, as it appeared to be one large shaft and moved in a uniform and completely synchronized manner.  It was obvious, in my sight, that this was one craft.  The sound, size and shape of the craft intrigued me, so I called my husband outside.  He arrived within several seconds and watched this craft with me.  He said that it “might be military” although he said he had never seen anything like it.  We both continued to watch the craft, which proceeded at what I would consider a “normal” speed for a low-flying aircraft.  The craft was about the side of a grapefruit, with my hand held up in the air to reference it.  The craft was low-flying enough for me to barely make-out the joined “boomerang” shapes—what I would estimate to be about 500-feet of elevation.  As my husband and I watched this craft pull away, we then noticed that it split into (2) separate and distinct craft.  The craft split apart from one another by approx. 10-fingers width.  We could see the (2) crafts at slightly different elevations and they flew obviously apart from one another.  The red “center” light was no longer visible.  The craft then came back together, but “side-by side” with no “space” between them.  They flew together in this manner, never returning to the “joined boomerang shape.”  My husband, somewhat of a skeptic, even said that “was weird” and that he “had never seen anything like that before.”  He st! ated tha t it may have been mid-air refueling of an aircraft coming from Vandenberg.  I consider this as a possibility, but wonder, why would they need to conduct mid-air refueling so low over a populated area and so close to Vandenberg itself?  -Vandenberg is only about 18-miles away “as the crow flies.”  Environment:  It was a clear and star-filled night and the houses in my development are spaced-out by at least 100 (or so) feet between one another and the condo association itself takes great care to curtail light “pollution.”  -The motto in our area is “Turn-out the lights, see the stars.”<n>

I was staying in a house in Rincon,PR along Rt. 115.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 5:10am I unlocked the gate and crossed the road for a 2 block walk to the bakery only to find it closed till 6:00am. I then returned to the front gate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to look up at this moment and noticed two bright objects  about the size of an aspirin held at arms length moving very fast following one another. The time was 5:20am, I know this because I tried to photograph it with my cell phone. I was facing west looking toward the ocean which was 4 blocks away. They were traveling in an SE direction toward the areas known as Lajas and Cabo Rojo P.R.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as they disappeared into some clouds.There was no sound and the sighting lasted about 30-40 seconds. They were flying over water as I viewed them at a 60 degree angle from where I was standing. I was exited because I knew exactly what they were. I live in an area of NY surrounded by  2 airports so I’m very familiar with aircraft lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that morning after 7am as I was getting ready to leave for the airport I was telling my cousin about the sighting. The TV was tuned to a local station (WAPA), someone had managed to videotape the  objects and it was being shown 2 hours later on TV. The interesting part it was filmed on the east coast at 5:22am, that’s over 100 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live in Sioux Falls SD and had just gotten home.  I do not smoke in the house so i go out on the deck in the back yard to smoke.  at night I&#39;m always looking at the southern sky and looking at the stars when the weather permits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought this thing was a cloud when I seen it out of the corner of my eye.  But when I looked strait at it my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest.  Then I thought it might of been a plane with no landing lights on coming in to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my eyes focused on it more and I thought it looked like a hang glider or a stealth bomber but this thing had a lot of dim blue/grey glowing lights on it at least 10 maybe 15.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing came in from the south east and swung in and up to the north it did not get right over head looking up I&#39;d say it got to an 75 to 80 degree angle off the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cant tell the distant but it looked fairly high up. If you hold a ruler out at arms length it was 3 1/2 to 4 inches wide from what looked like wing tip to tip it looked big!<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the time I first seen it to the time it faded away in the northern sky only took 30 sec to 1 min.  IT WAS AMAZING!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to work on some drawings of what it looked like and the path it took,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh yeah it did not move like you would think some thing shaped like a stealth bomber would it looked like it was kind of side ways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  See other reports for Chandler and Tempe, AZ, for the same date.

I tried calling the airports around here but got no answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The air traffic also died down as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

3/24/08 22:00|San Diego|CA|Triangle|10 seconds (?)|San Diego, CA sighting|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62691.html|76|ndxe200803| San Diego, CA sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I spotted a craft hovering in the sky near our home.  We were driving and stopped at an intersection to watch and listen.  It stayed in one location for a couple of seconds then darted over us heading north.  The craft made no noise and there was no traffic in the area or any other noise...very odd because of the proximity to MCAS Miramar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape seemed to be similar to the stealth plane, a triangular shape, black, with large lights on the underside toward the front.  One light was under the pointed nose with two or three lights on both sides, angled with the shape of the plane.  I believe the aircraft had lights on the upper side as well because of the soft light above it.  The lights were not spotlights; they did not cast a beam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I emailed a local news station with a half hour of the sighting, but never received a reply.  Nothing was ever reported in the news, so I am unable to confirm if others saw it as well.  Something else was very unusual:  the news did report that San Diego&#39;s commercial airport, Lindburg Field, was closed for a time due to fog.  Odd, because there was no fog that night.  The sky was clear, no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

3/24/08 20:45|Las Cruces|NM|Unknown|1 - 2 min.|Saw 2 white lights fly very close to airplane then disappear by fading away.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62392.html|78|ndxe200803| Saw 2 white lights fly very close to airplane then disappear by fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On March 24th or 25th My wife and I were out for a walk about 8:45 PM in Las Cruces, NM.  It was a clear night with bright stars and no clouds.  I saw two lights moving from the west towards the east in the sky moving at what appeared to be a constant speed and in a straight line, about as fast as a small airplane would be going.  The two lights had just flown almost directly over the Las Cruces Airport.  The two lights were bright white color and were not flashing or blinking.  One was in front and was a little larger and brighter than the one following it.  Their alignment was straight with the path and the distance between the lights remained constant.  They remained the same brightness until right before they disappeared which I will describe later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not hear anything but I didn&#39;t think that was unusual.  I pointed the lights out to my wife and remarked how it might be an airplane except the lights weren&#39;t blinking and there were no red lights.  I said it seemed strange for a plane to not have flashing or blinking lights.  It crossed my mind that it could be a UFO but I still thought it was probably a plane.  She said it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it and within a few seconds noticed an airplane flying west by northwest.  The second plane had flashing red lights and non flashing white lights and didn&#39;t seem unusual in any way.  The plane and the lights we saw first were heading in a way that they looked like their paths would intersect.  They looked as if they were on a collision course.  So we watched, not really excpecting them to collide, but just watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the plane and the lights intersected, it was hard to tell if the lights passed under or over the plane.  Their intersection appeared to happen almost directly overhead.  So far there was nothing really strange except for there being no flashing lights accompanying the two white lights.  The strange thing that happened was: immediately after the plane and lights intersected, the two white lights faded away to nothing.  the fading away was fairly fast but not instantaneous.  It seemed to take about a second for the fading to be complete.  Then the two white lights never reappeared.  There were no clouds and the airplane had just passed through the same part of the sky immedialty before yet it did not fade out of sight or even get dimmer momentarily.  The airplane was still visible and continued on it’s way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both thought what we had just seen was very strange.  I suggested it might have been an alien spaceship but my wife dismissed that idea.  I really can’t think of a good explanation for the lights fading away like that and a few people who I described it to also thought it was weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither my wife or I had been drinking or smoking anything.  I have not drank ( or smoked anything ) in over 23 years.  I am a computer scientist working for the Army at White Sands Missile Range and my wife is a Chinese immigrant.  It might be possible to check with the Las Cruces airport to see if  1 plane or 2 planes where flying over the area just to the east of the airport at around 8:45 PM on those nights.  I will try to remember exactly which night it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were naming the constellations, when we noticed three, not-very-bright lights (outlining a chevron--one light at the point, two lights at either end of the chevron)cruising very smoothly and at amazing speed through the sky. I thought it was a airplane, but there were no flashing lights. The lights were round and chalk-colored. My husband, both of my young children and I witnessed the lights. The lights flew above us (at the height of a low-flying airplane) and then seemed to speed up and, instead of lowering in the north near our airport, whisked away into the upper reaches of the sky until we couldn&#39;t see them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I feel it is my/ our duty to report these now being at least the 7th time since last fall at odd times of night, they also have darted upward out of sight and 1 time seemingly into the water downward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did witness 1 other time 1 then 2 and 3 all appear and form a triangle all the same kind of amber objects for only about 3-5 minutes and then all of a sudden they were interrupted by a bright very fast blue orb that shot down from the high stratosphere from dues S. West--like a shooting star at the 3 objects and then they all took off very fast in 3 opposite directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something is going on that is NOT of the ordinary and if it is something from the military –AKA – US AIR force based out of Niagara Falls, NY they surely would not admit to that.

I believe they where commercial liners, but I am not positive on that. While I was watching them, and trying to figure out why they were so close to each other, I saw a saucer shaped object suddenly appear to the south of them. The planes were flying west to east. I was driving east to west, so they were coming at me in clear sight. The object that I saw was hovering. Since the planes where moving, it was very clear that the saucer shaped object was sitting still. It remained in the same position for about ten seconds then disappeared in an instant (while I was looking at it) without a trace. At that point the planes sped up to a much faster speed then they where flying at before the object appeared.  This was in no way possible a reflection or gas vapors exploding from the sun. I saw a unidentified-flying-object - U.F.O<n>

It did not move for about 5 minutes. It seem to be very high up and in broad daylight it just stayed there. I asked all around me if they could see it and they did, we took a few pictures of it but they did not come out too well since it was so high up. it was almost directly above us. Though it did not move at all it did just disapear right in front of our eyes. Have no Idea what this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were parked on a small side road in Sedona, Arizona (with a sign that said “private residences” or something like that that my dad ignored!), just before the main road takes you to a large parking area.  We were standing in a small empty lot between two houses.  This picture was taken in between two other pictures taken at 4:08 pm and 4:16 pm.  The UFO image in this photo is not in the other two photos taken before and after.  Two other people with me were also taking photos at around the same time and the UFO is not in their photos, either.  None of us saw it with our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took this picture with a Nikon Coolpix L12V1.0.  The picture has the following properties:  fstop – f/5.7; exposure time – 1/172 sec; ISO speed – ISO-50; exposure bias – 0 step; focal length – 6mm; max aperture – 3.4; metering mode – pattern; size – 3072x2304; 300 dpi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very interesting, to say the least.  I’m very skeptical when it comes to UFO claims.  But this picture really caught my eye when I was scrolling through my photos after downloading them to the computer.  I couldn’t believe it, actually, and we all had a good laugh.  My family has been pressing me to report this for months.  I finally am doing so now.  After attempting to recreate an image with a UFO in it by putting a small fleck of paper on the lens, and also throwing rocks in the air to try to catch a snapshot of one of them to see if a similar image could be created, we couldn’t do it.  It didn’t work.  I don’t know what this UFO in my picture is, but I’m becoming more and more convinced it’s not a fleck of dust or a rock being thrown.  Maybe it’s a skeet?  I have no idea.  I don’t know if there are any skeet shooting ranges in that area.  Or maybe it’s an alien vessel?  Maybe we’ll never know.  I do know at this point it is truly an unidentified flying object – and perhaps an unidentifiable flying object at that!<n>
3/24/08 05:00|Campbell Hall|NY|Triangle|30 minutes|2 hovering bright lights, no sound, over NY. Saw manta ray or triangle object flying very slow,whooshing sound|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62421.html|86|ndxe200803| 2 hovering bright lights, no sound, over NY. Saw manta ray or triangle object flying very slow,whooshing sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I were in the driveway getting out of our car going into the house. I noticed 2 bright white balls of light hovering over the tree tops about a quarter mile away.There was no noise. We couldn&#39;t figure out what they were, so we walked across the road and all over the front lawn and driveway trying to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw one of the lights shoot down a pulsing like red ray and white lights also flashed and moved around at the same time. It also looked like a huge beam of white light was coming down from underneath both of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for 3-4 minutes.  All the while these 2 things stayed absolutely still and made no noise at all. As soon as we both took out our camera phones and took a picture, both lights immediately brightened and became much larger. It was as if they saw us and were talking to each other somehow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then one started slowly moving toward us while the other one slowly moved off to the side and rose up a little higher. We watched this light move ever so slowly toward us. It flew directly over our heads as if in slow motion. It was so low and only made a low whooshing like sound. It was like a manta ray shape or some kind of rounded triangle.  It was shiny, black metallic like. The underside had some kind of square indentations, like a grid almost. There was a red flashing light in front and 2 white flashing strobe lights in the back. It had 3 white lights underneath toward the back of it. On each side were 2 rocket like things that were a lighter color like gray.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched both of these things fly ever so slowly and quietly until we couldn&#39;t see them over the mountains. We looked around for 1-2 minutes then heard a very low noise unlike any plane or helicopter. We turned and saw the same 2 bright lights hovering in the same exact spots! By now we were extremely freaked out so we woke up our brother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all live near a military airport base so we are used to different aircraft and how they sound. The 3 of us watched these things for a few minutes silently hover above the tree tops. When my brother shined a flashlight toward them they did the same thing. The light immediately became larger and brightened and it started to move toward us. Only this time it was up a little higher and off to the side of us. The other one rose up and over and hovered behind the tree tops. We couldn&#39;t see it clearly like the first time, but I did manage to get a few seconds of it on video tape-mainly the rear lights. We are in our 30&#39;s, have children and jobs. We are regular people who saw something strange in the sky that night. I have been searching the internet for info and similar reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I tried to go back to sleep and then decided to get up to use the bathroom.  Upon return back to my bedroom I was startled to see that the room was filled with bright orange light.  The light was intense as it streamed through the northeasterly facing window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shadows were cast in the folds of the curtains.  I went to the window and saw a rather large (dime at arms length) orange sphere of bright light directly ahead approximately 200 feet away viewable just over the space between the roofs of two houses on the hill in front of me.  I turned to get my glasses and all of the orange light suddenly disappeared so I immediately turned back to the window.  The light blinked on and off two or three times and then completely ceased to be visible.   I continued to watch for it out of the window but it did not return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in the week of 3-24-08, my sister who lives 2 streets away in the same northeasterly direction stopped by for a visit.  One of the first things she said to me was, &#34;What was up with that orange light Monday?&#34;  However she saw a more diffused generalized orange glow over a school ball field immediately in front of her house that spread over a couple of blocks and she saw it in the evening of that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange light of 3-24-08 was the sixth sighting in my lifetime thus far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported another to NUFORC that occurred on 1-12-08 and was witnessed by more people than just myself.  I am a contactee and I converse regularly with other experiencers on an almost daily basis.  I am mentioning this because during the period of time just prior to 3-24-08, many of my abbductee acquaintances reported paranormal experiences and there was a general consensus that &#34;something is going on.&#34;   For example, one friend saw an entity at his bedside; another had a sighting, and another suffered nosebleeds after a &#34;dream&#34; visit with a &#34;man&#34; that she has not seen for many years but has come to think of as sort of a guardian angel.  I find it odd that I have had two sightings already in 2008 and that my last previous sighting was 24 years ago in 1984.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 500 Lights On Object0: Yes<n>

The moon was not visible, the sky was clear, there was no wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife noticed something in the sky and said &#34;look at that!&#34; I turned to see a very large manta ray shaped object coming from the South east headed north towards Ontario Oregon across Highway 86. The object appeared to be under 1,000 feet in altitude but over 500 feet in altitude and was moving at a steady pace and appeared to be gliding along rapidly with a wing span I estimate from between 230 to 250 feet. crescent shaped front end and had a protrusion in the middle of the back portion. It looked exactly like a giant manta ray with a short tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Object was almost the color of the sky like it was supposed to be camouflaged but lighting from the ground made it possible to be seen, it completely blocked out the stars that would have been visible had it not been there and it&#39;s shape was determined by the outermost edges of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise as it came towards us, no noise as it was directly overhead and no noise after it passed by. It had no lights, No writing, and no visible fire from a jet or any sort of engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after it had passed I thought that it&#39;s color was so odd that it was like if you were to take a large mirror into high grass of all the same color and then witness the mirror reflecting the grass back at you from a distance - it would be hard to tell where the mirror was unless it was moving the Color was so odd that i believe the object may have been super shinny and was only allowing us to see its camouflaged surface, the flaw being fairly bright ground lights shinning straight up onto the bottom, and also the fact that a star you could see would not be visible as it passed between us and the star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be gliding rapidly - it was only visible for about 15 seconds before it was too far away to see any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all, I have not seen it since but I am keeping an eye out for it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

3/23/08 13:45|Gallup|NM|Formation|20 minutes|12 object formation over NW New Mexico on Easter Sunday|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62880.html|95|ndxe200803| 12 object formation over NW New Mexico on Easter Sunday<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 1:45P and my wife, two kids (female age 7 and son 8 months old), and I had packed up our vehicle and were northbound from our home on the way to her parents for Easter Sunday family outing.  She was driving while I rode in the front passenger side.  The road to the highway from our home slopes downhill and gives you a view of NW Gallup on the outskirts and a railroad system that goes W to E.  I was describing to my wife an encounter that had happened to my brother and I, just the day before almost exactly 24 hours ago.  I then looked ahead above the railroad tracks as we went down the hill and saw a bright white round object and I stated that what I had seen earlier looked exactly like it!  While we proceeded closer I could see that it was not moving in any conventional manner.  It did not appear to be moving at all.  Suddenly two more identical objects appeared to the N and to the SW of the initial object.  We turned down Highway 66 and I had become quite excited by this point.  We took another turn which goes north and across the railroad tracks and then took another right which takes you down Warehouse Lane, which is home to Burlington Northern, and a few other municipal installations.  I had my window rolled down and I had not taken my eyes off of the formation when we had come to a stop off the side of the road.  I got out and looked above and could still see three objects when suddenly I could see one more, then another, then 6.  They seemed to just appear from nothing and then I detected some that looked like they were coming down from space at very high speed.  They zipped down so fast that a few looked almost like a meteor coming down.  They were all moving independent of each other and it had gotten to a point were I could count up to 12 of them.  They were at different altitudes from each other but all were going in a mostly W – SW direction.  It was partly cloudy and windy at about 20-25 mph from the SW.  I noticed one object that was different from the rest in that it was quite a bit larger than the rest (about the size of a quarter held at arms length) and was rapidly rotating and changing forms.  It looked somewhat translucent but it seemed like it had some kind of field that enveloped around the shape of the object.  Around the edge of the field was slightly brownish and seemed much closer than the other objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see approaching aircraft coming in from all directions and are what I would deduce to be military jumbo type aircraft.  When a few of these planes came close a few of the objects actually appeared to be playing with the jets.  They flew in very close proximity to the planes and flew even alongside them for a moment or two.  The formation almost seemed like a flock of geese or a school of fish in the ocean the way in which they moved with each other. There was no noticeable noise that came from these objects.  They all slowly disappeared through a cloud front that was approaching from the W or by just disappearing as the fleet headed W.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was at 55 degrees to the horizon facing and moving SW to a NE direction heading over and towards the north slope of the Sandia Mountains north of the city limits of Albuquerque.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I observed was what I though was a seagull or white bird catching thermals at a high altitude…the more I looked at it I notice a unusual side to side flight as if it was fluttering like a butterfly might fly. It was moving slow in a NE direction and notice it was blinking every one to three second intervals but at a location different from the other and no sound was heard, giving a fluttering appearance. At arms length the flash was the size of a button.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting seem to last two to three minutes before it was beyond the horizon from my view.  It was defiantly below the clouds and my guess is about the same altitude of private single or twin engine planes? I attempted to try and take photos with my cell phone but was unable to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second sighting was in August or September? of 1992? (unsure of date and year) on Albuquerque’s Westside at the apartment complex I was living at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was sunrise on a weekend and I witness a oval, white illumined almost like the moon glow at a 75 degree angle from the horizon going north to south behind one cloud to another going three to four times faster than a commercial jet. At arms length it was the size of a quarter with no sound. A couple also witnesses what I seen and I made the comment to them if it was a shooting star? And one of them said that they don’t think so!  I am always watching the skies when ever I get a chance and I am very familiar with commercial, military and civilian aircraft as we have a Air force base and commercial and private airports near by.<n>

The light was quite bright and low enough that my first thought was that it was a flare being fired from somewhere nearby.  I said, &#34;What the f*** is that?&#34;, but the light vanished before I finished the sentence.  The light did not fade out or burst like a flare or fireworks would, it just vanished in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was also moving in a straight line, like a flying object and not something shot into the sky (which would presumably travel in an arch across the sky).  It was moving quite fast before it disappeared.  The object was moving so quickly and was so bright my boyfriend and I were stunned into silence when it vanished.  Neither one of us know quite what to make of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife was at the wheel while I tried to get some sleep in the passenger seat on the drive home. About 40 minutes into the drive, my wife woke me, and told me to look to my right (westward)and up. Since we had been admiring the full moon earlier, and how clear it was, I got somewhat irritated and refused. She pulled over to the shoulder got out of the car, came to the passenger side opened the door and told me to look again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Off to the southwest and under the full moon we saw a gold/green shinny cylinder about the size of a city bus hovering over the tree tops. No noise, no movement. No windows. Just hovering about 500 metres from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought the Northen Lights were way too low in the sky and my wife agreed, and mentioned that the shape and non-movement could not make this the Northen Lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The gold/ green sheen flowed in a rhythmic motion from front to back. I looked around to see if any other motorists would stop to see what we were looking at. No-one else was on the road at that hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife said &#34;Advertizing Balloon?&#34; I grabbed a handfull of road shoulder gravel and one by one threw them to see if I could hit the &#34;balloon&#34;. It was too far to hit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there for about 4 minutes looking up, and out at the highway to see if other motorists would also stop. Not a single car passed nothbound or south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With no noise, the cylinder moved south west for about 200 metres at slow speed and at the same altitude, then flew straight up at a fantastic speed and disappeared into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there for another 4 or 5 minutes. Looking up, and to the direction where we had originally seen the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a good deal of speculation and commenting on what we had just seen. We are both sensible people. Non-drug users. Responsible professionals in our job fields. Yet nothing in our minds can make any reason of what we saw. I had to wait until she got to bed before I could find this web site and relay this to you. My wife wants this to become a &#34;non-event&#34;, or people will thing &#34;we&#39;re crazy&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I may be crazy; she may be crazy; but there is NO WAY we could be crazy at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/23/08 01:30|Amelia|OH|Cylinder|1 minute|SILENT OBJECT OVER AMELIA OHIO 3/23/08  1:30AM|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62342.html|102|ndxe200803| SILENT OBJECT OVER AMELIA, OHIO, 3/23/08  1:30 AM<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3/23/08 approx. 1:30 A.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amelia, Ohio  While on the back deck of a friend’s house, saw an object moving slowly from the northwest to southeast at an altitude roughly between 125 and 250ft above the ground. It was not much higher than the tree line. I work in the defense industry, and I’m an aircraft technician by trade, and consider myself very familiar with many different types of aircraft. However, this was something I’ve never seen or heard about in the industry. This object came within about 100 yards from where I was standing, at roughly the earlier stated altitude of 125-250ft above the ground. This object had a very bright light at the bottom of it, which looked to be encased in a housing of some sort, because it gave off a slight lampshade affect directly above the light itself allowing me to see that it was attached to an object. The shape reminded me of  a canister, similar to an aluminum soda can, but again making out the object above the light was somewhat difficult because the light was so bright. I could see that above the main light there was no sort of lighting on the object. The main light itself was not bright white, but off white to a yellowish white. The light was very similar in color to a set of lights you might see over a highway or large parking lot, not quite bright white, but an off white. My best estimate was that this object was 4 to 6 feet in width and approximately 6 to 8 feet in height including the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this object approached just above the tree line from the northwest, it must have taken close to  15 seconds to reach its closest point to me, again roughly 100 yards from where I was standing. It looked to be moving very slowly under 20mph. As the object reached its closest point to me, I opened the back door, and instructed my friends to come look at the object. Four other people besides myself witnessed this from this time on. When the object was at it’s closest, it appeared to stop for roughly 10 seconds, when I noticed a slight rocking motion from it. It looked like the craft stopping caused the rocking motion, which appeared to rock 1 or 2 feet in both directions. The object made no sound at all, during the complete time I witnessed it. After the object paused in place for roughly 10 seconds, it changed it’s original direction towards the southeast, to the southwest. From this point it stayed in a straight line, moving slowly above the tree line, for another 20 seconds or so, when the light suddenly went out for 3 to 5 seconds, and suddenly reappeared for another few seconds then disappeared for good. After the object changed direction, although still moving slowly, did pickup some speed possibly 30 to 40mph until I last saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impression of this sighting, was that it was very likely manmade, and reminded me of some sort of surveillance craft. It was not like anything I have witnessed or heard about in the industry, but did not do anything beyond current defense technology. I was however very surprised that it did not make ANY noise whatsoever.<n>
3/23/08 01:30|Liberty Twp|OH|Unknown|45 min|Bright flashing lights seen in the night sky, same area every night, odd movement.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62325.html|103|ndxe200803| Bright flashing lights seen in the night sky, same area every night, odd movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 1:30 am March 23 I was walking past my hall window on my way to bed when I noticed how bright the moon was.  I stopped to look out at the night sky and I noticed a twinkling bright light in the sky that was much larger than the stars.  I thought it might be a plane or planet but its movement, size and the blinking multi-colored lights suggested otherwise.  I watched it for about 45 min.  The lights were blinking from side to side and were red, white, and what might have been green, blue or purple.  It was hard to tell what the colors were as the object was pretty far away but they were clearly multi-colored and extremely bright.  I steadied myself against the wall and put a finger on the window because I couldn’t tell if it was moving or not at first.  My finger was on the window just under the object and as I watched, it moved in all directions.  It went left, right, side to side, and diagonal and at times got closer and farther away.  It seemed to be just hanging out in one particular area of the sky but was moving around in that area.  I have noticed this object before in the same spot as much as a year ago and didn’t really pay much mind to it.  I also saw it following night around the same time but this time I saw it more clearly.  It seemed slightly closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was watching it on the first night I saw something else.  It was a glowing orange thing that appeared to be much closer and larger though it was hard to place exactly where it was in the sky as it happened very quickly.  It appeared out of nowhere, accelerated and disappeared into thin air.  All I saw of it was the orange glow and the tail that seemed to form when it accelerated.  It was either moving too fast for me to see after it accelerated, or it just disappeared, I can’t say which, but this object was just over the tree tops and was very large.  Far too large to be a comet or something like that and it was moving in an upward arc.  I would have never seen it had I not been watching the sky already.  I had a clear view of the sky in front of where it appeared and it really just seemed to come from nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 25 year old college student and mother of one.  I have never seen a UFO before and frankly didn’t think I ever would but when I saw this object I knew it couldn’t be man made just by the way it was moving.  It was really pretty startling to see how it moved and I have never seen anything like it before. It was high enough in the sky that it would have been easily overlooked.  I also noticed on the second night, closer to 2 am, that whenever a car happened to drive by on my street the object almost seemed to follow it with a light, as though it were watching the people below.  This could have just been my eyes getting tired but it really looked like the lights on the craft were pointing in the direction of my street whenever a car would pass and the object seemed to move around more.  It seemed to be more active when cars passed, almost as if it were trying to get their attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither the blinking object or the orange object made any sounds that i could hear and there was no smoke or anything like that following the orange object.  I was unable to tell the shape of the blinking object because all I could make out were the lights.  The second night it looked closer but it was a slightly cloudy night and the object seemed to be in a clouded or hazy area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/23/08|Salt Lake City|UT|Oval||On going events all my life, now the UFO's have changed.. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|7/10/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76200.html|104|ndxe200803| On going events all my life, now the UFO&#39;s have changed..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen UFO&#39;s off and on all my life.  My father even talk&#39;s about seeing a cigar shaped UFO while fixing a roof for my grandparents when I was 3 years old.  He saw me on the front lawn when there was a bright light.  My father and his twin brother saw the craft and the light.  I dissapeared for 4 day&#39;s then just showed up on my grandparents front lawn with no explimation.  This was in Chesterfield, UT, June 1960.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then March 1973, my ex-husband and I were driving from Tucson AZ to Salt Lake City.  I was driving and he was sleeping in the back seat.  I remember pulling out of Flagstaff AZ and watching the light behind me turn red.  Next thing I remember is being in Park City Utah. I don&#39;t know how much time had passed because we did not have a clock or watch with us.  No gas had been used and my exhusband was bleeding out of his nose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I for whatever reason was bleeding from my virgina as if on my period.  The bleeding quit almost immidiatly. Five years later I was almost 5 months pregent when I suddenly found myself in the bathroom with blood all over and no longer with child.  I did not go to the doctor for fear of being told I was crazy.  However I do remember holding a little boy that was moving and his head was too big and his neck was extra long.  Why I would remember that I don&#39;t know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do know that my exhusband was very upset when at the next appointment when the doctor said that I had miscarried.  I have had a history of losing babies.  While I have four children I have had 4 miscarraiges or what the doctor indicated was a misscariage. Each time I was almost 5 months along and then no longer with child. No memmory of losing the baby.  In one case twins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No known reason until recently.  They tell me I have Protine S Diffency with clogaophthy.  And some other unknown genitic disroder they do not understand.  They see it the blood however have no idia what it is.  It is killing me.  Why no one understands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Normally the craft is extreamly large when I do see them.  When they do apear they are large enough for occupation and are disc shaped.  The one time I saw more than one UFO the disk was chasing a craft that looked like a cigar.  There was also a boomarange type craft almost acting like a wing man to the disk shaped craft.  There seemed to be artilary being used because I saw what seemed to be a direct hit to the cigar shaped craft.  They all just winked out.  This incident happen while I lived in Amhurst OH in the summer of 1974.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many times in Tucson AZ we have UFO activity when the Airforce will send aircraft afther the objects.  This happens at least once a year.  We have even been listening to the radio outside and heard reports about a possible UFO then nothing.  I have even been speaking on the phone with my sister when I&#39;ve seen the UFO and then all sort&#39;s of aircraft from the base chasing the UFO right over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In May of 2000 I saw a strange craft above the apartment building I was living at and even had a wittness.  A man that also lived there.  He moved the next day without a word. The craft looked to be the size of a 50 gallon drum.  It just floated there.  No sound. No lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the crafts are extreamly small.  No larger than my finger nail.  The 1st time I saw one that small was in Salt Lake City, Utah when I went for a funerl in March of 2008.  Then in July 4th, 2009 in Phoenix AZ.  June 29, 2010 in Tucson, AZ I saw it again. I&#39;ve seen it six times sense then. I am very delighted yet concerned.  Each time this happens seems to be when a storm is comming about or just ended.  There will be small flashes from the object of different colors.  They hang around for about 10 to 15 minutes.  If I go into the house they come right up to the patio door and stay there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one this morning it was clear weather when I took my little grandaughter outside to play in the backyard. One of the miniture UFO&#39;s actually landed on my little grandaughter.  She is 21 months old.  When I tried to grab it my hand went right through it.  I picked her up and brought her in the house.  The craft just hovered at the door.  Why if my hand went through the thing does it stay outside.  I do not want my grandaughter involved with this for any reason.  Yet it seems that I have no choice.  Is there any other reports of these miniture UFO&#39;s?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

She lives in an area where there is not much light pollution. There is some from a near by gas station and some street lights and a liquor store and houses that would emit light.  I walked out first and she was still up stairs locking the door.  I’m an observant person and always look up at the sky to see what stars are out.  I waited at the steps for her to grab her things and lock the door.  We began to walk to her car and I was still looking up and was going to comment on how it would be a good night for telescopes. When I looked up, there were five disc shaped objects flying in a perfect diagonal line heading north east.  I was scared at first and extremely uneasy. The car wanst unlocked yet and she noticed me acting out of sorts and I remember saying, &#34;look, look, look up!!!&#34;  I was frantic. I ran around the car and grabbed her head and pointed her eyes to the sky where they should have been, but there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had disappeared. After the sighting I became tremendously nervous about what I have seen.  I have always wished to see a U.F.O. and now, I wished I haven’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were five of them in a perfect diagonal line flying north east. There was no sound and no lights. I believe they were pretty close in proximity to the ground.  They moved very gracefully in formation, they had to have been at least 20-25 feet apart from each other.  I know as well as anyone that balloons do not fly in such a tight pattern. The only way these objects were visible is due to the very low lights in the area; it seemed like five soft balls flying together.  I don’t know any other way to describe them.  I have called the local authorities to tell them about this sighting. I have always believed in U.F.O.s and now I wish I have never seen these tonight.  I am honestly scared and excited at the same time.  I dunno. I wish to get in contact with people that share the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a smart person and I know that these objects were not of anything made by man.  I wish I have never saw them.  I would rather wonder than to know now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Name deleted))<n>

We had ascended to a nearby cliff division and took a five minute break.  There was a wind from the SW 15-20 mph and the skies were mostly clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a few large aircraft pass through overhead which is normal in this area.  I looked away viewing the area around us when I look back up - directly above our resting location when I noticed a large round white object.  It was about one-half the size of the moon at this point and was not moving.  I pointed it out to my brother and we looked at it for about 2-3 minutes while it remained motionless above us.  It was obvious to us that it was not a balloon and did not resemble any of the other aircraft in the vicinity.  I had sunglasses on that have polarized lenses so I could see with fair clarity when I realized the object had nearly doubled in size and had turned mostly bright red.  My brother seconded this observation and the object began rotating and changing its physical appearance.  This began happening about 5 minutes after our initial sighting.  It was rotating in a clockwise motion and appeared almost translucent or had some kind of field around it that gave it a translucent appearance.  The red color of the object slowly became larger and smaller as it rotated.  It would become oblong, oval, round, square, and sometimes appear to have protrusions that seemed to come out of the body of the object itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then noticed large aircraft begin coming in from all directions and seemed to have changed their original trajectory in order to come into contact with the object.  Presumably they are of military origin and had detected them on radar or from some type of space platform.  3 of these aircraft came close to the object but I am unable to approximate the altitude.  You could see contrails that slowly disappeared behind the jet aircraft.  Then the object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for about two minutes when suddenly an identical type of object as the first appeared in the same location and was bright white and was also rotating.  Then a small bright turquoise light appeared to come out of it and was shining much brighter than a star.  It moved away from the other craft and appeared to dance around to the side of the other object for about 3-4 minutes.  I could see more aircraft begin to aim towards the objects when suddenly the phenomenon disappeared.  We waited for about a half hour and no other objects were sighted on that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day Sunday, my family and I witnessed a larger sighting that I will report for the appropriate date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had also submitted an earlier report which can be seen at<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16585.html<n>

No Doppler effect, noise just stopped. Then a bright orange light that had been stationary low on horizon just above the tree line moved approx 1 mile in 1 minute from E to NE. Looked like moving streetlight or a plane with no blinking lights. Disappeared out of field of view behind building in foreground and didn&#39;t come out other side. Local airport had no flights listed. I waited several minutes. no further noise or lights. I did get some video but it is not very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A light moving from the South to the North caught our eye through the upper windows of the room.  It was 5 or 6 times larger, and 7 or 8 times brighter than the North Star. It moved approx. 70 degrees in a flat trajectory in about a second and a half, stopped for about a second, and moved out of sight to the East in about 2 seconds. The deceleration and acceleration were both instantaneous. Altitude is hard to estimate, as we did not see it relative to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 4 or 5 minutes later a similar light moved across the windows from West to East, in the same direction as the first light moved after it stopped. It seemed to be moving  at the same speed as the first light and was gone in about 2.5 seconds.<n>

Then we noticed this thing was roughly 8,0|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62296.html|114|ndxe200803| My friend and I encountered an object in the sky that at first we thought was a plastic bag. Then we noticed this thing was roughly 8,000 feet up and about 5 to 6 miles away. It kept changing shapes until settling on a ball of light. It moved from a south position, to a south-east position and back again several times, at which point another object, much fainter than the first appeared, moved from a southern position in relation to the original object, then began to circle it in a clockwise fashion. We were all at a local cafe, and several people went outside to see what the fuss was about. I had stopped a River Patrol Bicycle police officer to visually confirm what we were seeing. After several minutes the two objects shot straight up and out of view. We then noticed fighter jets circling the sky where the object(s) had been. I have taken a photo of it with my cell phone camera and so did my friends girl friend. I also took a photo of the fighter jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to several websites, and it did not exemplify the behavior of the naked eye GRB that took place that day, nor did it seem like a star in keeping with the rotation of the Earth as it would only move in one direction if this were the case. I also went to see if it was a satellite, no luck there. I&#39;m at a loss to explain this in conventional terms. These objects were witnessed by several people in the downtown Reno area. And one person in the Northtowne area of Sparks, Nevada.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was partly cloudy, but the moon could be seen clearly for a few minutes every 10 minutes or so. I was watching the moon for maybe two minutes when I saw and oject zip by. If you can imagine the moon as a clock face, the object zipped from the 2PM position to the 11 o&#39;clock position and out of view into the night sky. It was black...and left sort of a motion trail. It was too small to really get a visible on shape or size. I don&#39;t know if it was a UFO, but cannot think of anything else it could be given its trajectory path.<n>

I noticed that objects were close as they were to my direct left after I drove about half a mile. I then could see that they were stationary in the sky and appeared to be &#34;lantern/disc-like&#34; structures that glowed gold. I pulled to the side of the highway and put on my emergency lights. They were in a formation that appeared to be like a scoop. They were silent and hovered over an open field maybe the equivalent of five or six city blocks away from where I was parked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to snap a few photographs what I had seen and when I was manipulating my digital camera to change settings to get a clearer picture, I looked up and noticed that the lights were quickly hovering and moving in unison southbound. I pulled my car back into traffic and continued driving south and noticed other vehicles pulled over to the side of the highway.The lights then seemed to disappear behind hills. I then noticed 2 fast aircraft with red lights flying toward the general vicinity of where I had seen the formation of lights.  I drove 10 miles further south and switched over to 880 south via Mission and looked east and noticed an intensely bright gold light with a smaller light above it hovering over a distant town.<n>

Looked to be very large! My Father an Air Traffic Controller had witnessed it and was in complete shock of the sight. Saying in all his years with the Air Force and now an Air Traffic Controller could not explain the object! We walked back to our site and talked about what we had seen, thinking it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later, my Mother noticed in the distance over the east end of the lake, strange light in the sky once more. My Father had his binoculars ready by then and we took turns watching this object become closer with no sound. He said it must be a mile long. But all you can see is its lights, nothing else. The closer it got we started seeing the end lights break off from it in the direction they where pointed and slowly as they went downwards form same size object as the one they broke off of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be circling in the same directions over the first mountain to the south of us and back around through the east part of the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event lasted about an half hour and two more objects broke off the main one, until the main object turn shape into a diamond and the others disappeared. The main object, now a diamond shape slowly made its way over the north mountains and was gone!<n>

It was a very smooth and fast movement; I followed the object and stayed in eye contact for 2-3 minutes.

It was bright white with a distinct glowing aura.  We noticed it made no sound.  Later we could see and hear other aircraft as we were in close proximity to Atlanta airport.  It flew straight over us into the Southeastern sky.  I say flew, but both of us remarked that it seems to &#34;slide&#34; along the sky.  We both observed the object with binoculars to see a cigar or &#34;pill&#34; shaped craft with no other observable lights.<n>

The house wasn&#39;t completely finished internally, but there was a pool table so we did have a pastime. The time we arrived was somewhere around 9:00pm-10:00pm.  As the night progressed I became bored and decided to get some fresh air outside.  The sky was very clear that night so the stars were very visible.  I looked upward and saw the strangest thing I have ever seen in my life.  A bright blue light was in the sky and at that moment it started moving at a speed that reminded me of how fast a satellite falls when it falls out of orbit. Then all of a sudden it just stopped completely. Although it was far in distance away, it was plainfully seen as a UFO right above the treeline. It started moving in circles and flashing strobe with colors that can be compared to a rave. It also seemed to be shining light from its belly towards the ground..maybe a beam? It was that moment that we noticed there was another one of these things in the sky a short distance away in width, but this one was a farther distance away.  They continued zig-zagging and moving in a circular formation for around an hour and disappeared. It looked as though one may have landed. What we saw cannot be explained. I do know that no aircraft in this world could do what was seen. Since then a friend and I have seen crazy things in the same vicinity. It feels awkward to tell people when they think your crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we watched it the object seemed to have a lot more lights then a usual aircraft. The lights looked as bright as the lights you would see at a pro baseball game shining down on the field.  The object in the air seemed to be square in the front, and that’s where all the lights where as well as the back end that came to a point with a bright red light that was not blinking it was solid RED! Looking as if it was a  bottle cap from the side.  We sat there and watched this object for a good solid two minutes, but no longer.  As it flew about in the sky at a sharp angle with fast speed, my friend and I where so frightened of what we have seen we took off with no more words left to say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness two, Thursday March 20, 2008 around 10:30 p.m., my friend and I were driving on our way to her house. I was in the passengers seat and she was the driver. The road that we were traveling on t-boned onto a road we had to turn left onto at a stop sign, which would be going East. As we approached the stop sign, I saw bright lights sinking diagonally downward past a group of trees. Jokingly I screamed &#34;UFO&#34; just trying to scare my friend. We turned left at the stop sign heading East towards her house. I was staring ahead at the road and, from the corner of my eye, I saw the flying object we had seen before, over a field. I knew it was the same object because from the side it looked like the shape of a flattened cylinder, and the lights were extremely bright, it was as if I was staring at a stadium from a distance. The lights on this object were incredibly bright and , the lights flashed once but, they never flashed again. I told my friend to stop the car, and she put her hazards on. We sat in her car on the side of the road, for about two minutes watching this object, which had stopped in the sky above a field, to our right. The object was about the height of a water tower above the field, so we knew it couldn’t have been an airplane because, airplanes don’t usually fly that low to the ground. After about two minutes, the object started to move away in the same direction it came from, but it went diagonally up at a fast speed, in the almost exact same path it lowered in. As the object was going up, I saw a red light which was not blinking at all. Frightened, I told my friend to just put the car in drive and leave. I knew we couldn’t have mistaken the object as a light from a city because, we were on back roads in the country and there aren’t many tall lights like we saw around, in a field.<n>

I noticed these two bright headlights above the tree tops, and I thought what are they?  It just couldn’t be a plane or a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I stopped my car and was watching the lights between the branches of the tree.  I was just looking to see how fast this thing was moving.  Well, it wasn’t moving very fast, it was just slowly gliding.  I then started to drive a little bit further, and the lights stopped moving forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought, what the heck is going on?  I stopped my car and the lights came toward us, above the car, closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 16 year old, who was sitting in the passenger seat, said, “Mom, let’s go, it’s just a plane!”  At that time I ended my conversation with my mom and focused on the lights, my son, did the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were right at the entrance of our driveway, and these lights were right above the tree tops, above our car.  The both of us looking up at the lights, still seated inside the car.  These lights were not blinding, but very large.  At this time I was a little freaked out because of what we were staring at, but then after about 3 seconds of looking directly up at this thing, the lights went dim and then went out..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, it didn’t take me long to put my foot on the gas and tear up our driveway.  I was NEVER so scared in my life.  I quickly called the house, because my boyfriend was home, to tell him to meet me downstairs.  I was crying and very scared for some reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 16 year old never believed in UFO’s, but I always thought they could exist.  Well, after tonight, we both are 100% convinced!  This freaked out the both of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I didn&#39;t think much of it as I thought it was an airliner on approach to IAH airport with it&#39;s bright landing lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as I continued to approach it, I realized that is wasn&#39;t moving, but hovering over the tree tops about two tenths of a mile off of the main road.  Also strange was the fact that despite a fairly clear evening, the object seemed to be shrouded in fog (too low for a cloud) and the large bright light began moving back and forth onto itself--more like a very large spot light.  Couldn&#39;t clearly see the object itself, but could see the light moving back and forth through the fog/vapor.  It was very large, 3-5 times the size of the largest airliner. It continued to hover as I passed it, and I turned off of the main road at first chance to get a better look.  The under side was also shrouded in fog that was illuminated by various small white lights with an overall triangular shape. There seemed to be a smaller platform underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned my vehicle to try to follow it, it very slowly and silently moved off towards the north, just above the tree tops out of view.  From the back it looked like a dark rectangular object with 3 large white lights across the back. It was too big for a helicopter or an airliner. There were no other aircraft in the sky at that time. FM 1960 is a busy road and I&#39;m sure someone else had to see it, however there are often planes passing through there on approach to IAH.  If you weren&#39;t really paying attention you might just assume it was an airliner--except it was hovering.<n>

It was moving fast enough to just catch a glimpse as it came into view of the front winshield, it looked like it came straight down and shot back up at a slight angle. It was moving at an extremely  high rate of speed. This was the most unexplainable thing that I have ever seen in my life, an object maybe 4 ft. in diameter,bouncing off the street in front of the car at an unexplainable rate of  speed, with no noise. I dont know if you have heard about anything similar to this, I have looked on the web for anything like this but have had no luck. Just wanna know if anyone else has seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be hovering but was moving slightly vertically, and horizontally. I watched it for 5 minutes, and then called my neighbor to witness what I saw.  She saw it as well, and said I should report it. I called 911 and they connected me to the UFO Center.  I reported the incident to Mr Peter Davenport, who asked that I write this narrative. I also reported it to WFAA TV...the ABC Affiliate in Dallas.  They said no other sightings had been reported to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While still viewing the object after 10 minutes, other American aircraft were flying around, over, and beneath the object. The American aircraft appeared to be military jets because there were smoke trails coming from the back of the crafts.  There were also domestic aircraft flying which looked MUCH smaller than the UFO, and I assume they were flying their regular routes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside to get my binoculars...and through them I could see the object much better. There appeared to be an orange color on the bottom of the craft. I called my mother, who lives 6 miles away from me, and she saw the disc as well.  I have enclosed pictures of the craft.  I cropped 1 of the pictures...and I left the other 2 photos untouched, so the tree line would be visible.  The object had been visible for 35 minutes when I got into my car and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came back home around 7:00 PM, but the object was no longer visible.<n>

Out pops this bright silver egg shaped object from the clouds to my left. It was moving very slow. I would guess, that it was 1400 -1600 yds away to the west, just under 1000 feet up, maybe a bit more. It was  very strange in that in saw completely silver , like a drip of mercury on it&#39;s side. No lights, to windows, no wings. The object much larger than an airplane in height. I scrambled for my cell phone to snap a picture and it vanished back into the clouds. Left me feeling  very puzzled as to what I just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first i thought it was the wind so i turned on the light to look outside and i could not see anything.  I kept hearing this loud sound hoovering above the house.  I walked around the inside of the house thinking maybe it was the house settling from the wind but there was no possible way the sound was inside of the house.  It just kept pulsating a loud deep vibration (it made a noise that sounded like this.. wawawawawa...).  I could not explain what was going on and it wasnt until my brother came down the steps in the morning and told me about a bizzare dream in which unknown beings who had larger eyes than normal were trying to convince him to go with them, (i dont want to say the word alien but he described them as sort of a hybrid half human/alien look, he even said some of them looked deformed) he was frightened by his dream because he said it felt so real.  I know this story sounds off the wall, but i find it very strange that i heard something hovering over the house for a long period of time and he woke up to tell me about a ufo dream.  I am hopeing other people heard or saw something in the sky that night so i dont think i am crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

She returned outside with me and was amazed! She then ran inside to awake my daughter who returned with her to witness this object.

Now, there is new construction going on every day and I wasn’t sure if the bright light was atop a new cell phone or radio tower that may have been built next door or if it was a search light on a helicopter. At first, I couldn’t tell whether the light was stationary or moving very slowly so those were the two possibilities that immediately came to mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked the car in front of my house and was about to unload groceries when I noticed the bright light was gone. Instead, an object was moving very slowly and steadily from the north, where I originally saw the bright light, to the south and it passed directly overhead, quite low in the sky. If I had to guess, I would say it was perhaps 20 stories from the ground. I couldn’t tell whether it was triangular or diamond-shaped, but it was one of those, judging by the half a dozen or so red and blue blinking lights on the underside of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can’t stress enough how slowly and how low in the sky it was much lower than a plane would fly. The other unusual thing I noticed was the sound it made. It was a humming sound that repeated in a circular fashion. It was definitely made by a machine, but it didn’t clank metallically, and it wasn’t high-pitched. It’s difficult to describe, but it was certainly rhythmic and repetitive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure how big it was because I couldn’t see the entire outline of the craft, but it was much larger than a helicopter and probably smaller than or about the size of a football field. I wasn’t afraid as I watched the object make its way slowly southward. Instead I was curious, trying to figure out what I was looking at. Unfortunately, my camera was in my upstairs bedroom and my camera phone is virtually worthless at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn’t long before I lost sight of the object and went into the house with my groceries. The time was exactly 11:30 pm when I walked in the front door. I estimate that the entire sighting took about five minutes. I awakened my housemate and told him what I’d witnessed, and then called my sister to tell her, too. I mentioned it to my boyfriend the following morning and he said that there are now planes that can hover, but that they would have no business doing that above a residential area. All I know is that it didn’t look or sound like any kind of plane I’ve ever seen or heard. One second it was there and the next, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was cold and clear.

I have floor to ceiling windows which allow me a pretty full view of the sky and the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While seated, I saw an abnormally bright peachy/red/orange light approach.  It was as if it appeared from out in the sky, not from over the mountain top, like a jet or helicopter. It was the color that caught me off guard.  We have many helicopters flying to the Desert Hospital over head, but this was not the same, they usually come from the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The item in my view was much higher in the sky, and actually much brighter.  It moved from the top of the mountain range, east, slowly, maintaining its brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightness was such that I could not discern any shape.  It was as if I were approaching a car with bright lights on in the evening, a stary glare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately felt that due to its color, which did not change, that it was very peculiar.  I was tempted to go inside and get my camera, but was afraid I would miss something, movement, whatever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, I kept watching it.  It moved from the mountain top to approximately 1/3 - ½ across the sky.  It stopped, as if hovering, as if it was a helicopter, and then, it took off, perpendicular to where I was standing, out into space and the very bright light was gone in  less then a two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to garner any fragment of light available by using the light sensitive area of the outer peripheral portion of my eye, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I don&#39;t know if you receive information about sightings and will use this to collaborate with other sightings; or if this is of any interest at all.  However, I was traveling close to my home on Route I-78 westbound just west of the Lenhartsville Exit in Windsor Township of Berks County, Pennsylvania.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 5:30 am and still dark.  Approximately 2 miles in the distance I saw very bright lights and thought nothing of it.  MediVac helicopters travel over my house frequently as I live close to Lehigh Valley Hospital and generally disregard them.   As I got closer, impossible as it seemed, the bright lights grew even brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When approximately 100 yards away the shape became clear in the dark.  It hovered over a grassy field on the left side of the four lane highway and was between 100 to 200 feet above the ground.  I could make out the shape and could see that the object was hovering without making the noise that helicopters make.  The shape of the object was like that of an arrowhead and three lights illuminated from the bottom with a red light in the center of the bottom of the object.  The red light didn&#39;t flash like typical strobe aircraft lights; it came on and went off slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time the object hovered and did not move.  I did not not have my CB radio on as it has not been working so I was unable to determine if other drivers saw what I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subsequently my wife checked the local newspaper for anything partaining to a UFO sighting.  Nothing was mentioned; however, a couple of miles after sighting the object I came across an accident where one truck driver rear ended another which tied up traffic.  I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if this driver had been distracted by the same object because judging by the degree of damage he hit the truck infront of him at quite a high rate of speed.  I had a tough time keeping my eyes on the road while being awe-struck and disbelieving what I was seeing.  Also, there had been another accident a short distance further down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if this is helpful to you or not.  I do know that what I saw was not a MediVac helicopter or any other flying object I&#39;ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please feel free to contact me on my cell phone should you want to discuss the matter further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))       March 18 2008 484-((number deleted)) ((e0address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be quite credible.

I thought, &#34;What is that?&#34;  I looked out the window and then noticed there were 2 bright lights, like the headlights of a car.  I was frightened as I was the only car around...and this THING in the air right above me.  I kept thinking &#34;What in the H--- is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed 3 lights,2 in the front again like car headlights and one in the back of them, the craft shaped like a triangle.  I had the windows down, there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to hover for awhile then started to gain speed and disappeared over the mountains in our area.

I walked closer to look and saw several smaller, quicker flashes of the same color in the southwestern sky over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was of such an unusual color that I was concerned, and having served active duty in the Air Force, I considered the rate at which the quick flashes occurred to either be weapons fire or a lightening storm.  I’ve seen several lightening storms, and they were never of this bright yellow/orange color.  My gut felt it was weapons fire of some type, and a sense of dread had me grabbing my dogs and running under the covers.  I don’t scare easily, but I was scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told myself I must be wrong, overreacting, or half-asleep, and that I would see on the news in the morning that it was simply lightening.  No such incident was reported on the morning news, and nothing found on an internet search.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw, and had to tell the truth in case somebody else noticed it or knows what it was and could explain it to me.<n>

I looked up in the sky to see the stars and saw a large red pulsing light in the western sky.  My immediate thought was, ‘who put that huge tower up today??’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Realizing the light was too big to be a light on top of a tower, and the fact that we live in a very rural part of NY state and do not have cell towers or otherwise in the area, I continued to watch the light.  It did not move.  It pulsed brighter, then duller in a continuous rythym.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house and up to my bedroom window on the second floor to continue to watch it.  I called both my son and daughter into the room so they could see it also.  We were all mystified as to what it could be.   It was continuing to pulse but was not moving in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to sleep and when I awoke in the morning to take my dog out again, it was STILL in the same position at 6:30am.  After watching it again for a few minutes it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited to send this report so that I could see if the same thing happened again last night (thereby possibly being some distant tower, knowing it couldn’t be), but there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the life of me, I do not know why I didn’t film it.  I  have no explanation.  That’s not like me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked a neighbor if she’d seen anything and she said she saw a strange light when she was coming out of her barn, but told herself it was a plane, even though she knew it wasn’t moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

My initial thought was airplane, but I soon realized that the lights were far too big and were not moving at all.  I could not make out the exact shape of the UFO but I could tell about how big it was by the alternate flashing of lights on either side of it.  The lights appeared to be a red-orange color and were quite large.  I pulled over on the side of the road and rolled my driver side window down and turned down the radio.  The lights grew dim and it disappeared.  I had no idea what I had seen and thought that it may have went behind a cloud but when I got to my house and observed the same spot in the sky where I had seen it, the sky was crystal clear and no clouds were in sight and all of the stars were out.<n>

The light that appeared to be coming from it was constant, with no twinkling or flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it track across the sky, it moved slowly in a northerly direction and then disappeared.  Shortly after it disappeared, I saw a small prop plane coming from the other direction and heading toward the small local airport in Belleville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not report to the authorities, but checked online to see if any other people had reported seeing anything.

I was relaxing in a hot tub in my back yard and just staring up (at an estimated 65-75 degree angle) when I happen to look directly at a fairly large (estimated school bus-sized) object with red lights appear, then quickly disappear (at an estimated 50 degree location) in the sky. It was obviously traveling at speeds faster than an airplane, which I admit, I am in an area where planes fly by frequently, but this is how I know it was not an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the most odd things I noticed about the object was it’s motion. I seemed to be making very close swerves, like a back and forth motion. They were not large movements, but noticeable in spite of it’s speed and duration of appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed that the object was below the cloud coverage, or seemed to be. I was very sure of this detail at the time, but looking back I question whether it was only my eyes telling me that, due to the thinness of cloud coverage. Accordingly, if it were not below the clouds, it would have been much larger than I thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling West-southwest.<n>

I saw a street light orange colored ball light up and turn, almost like a lighthouse, then disappear.  It was probably 300 feet in the air and maybe a mile away.  Then we drove past the tree line into an open area and  we saw three of the same color lights, same shape and size. We looked over and saw it was accompanied by 2 smaller lights  at a 45 degree angle to the ball. Then we started driving in the direction of town it was over and it was gone. We went down to the park and saw it a few times more in the distance and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The sky was blue and clear, and there were no clouds at all.  My husband said look I think it&#39;s UFO. I looked and I saw it too. It had a tall chrome domed shaped top.  The bottom kind of looked like a cooking wok but it was solid shiny lacquer black.  When we first saw it there was a type of loud noise like a jet engine, and then it was quiet. It stayed in the same spot in the sky without moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my husband said to go get the binoculars so that we could get a closer look at it.  So I went to get them in our car that was parked out front. When I came back, I went through the house and back to the backyard.  My husband came under the awning and got the binoculars from me. When we stepped back out onto the lawn the UFO had vanished.  The loud jet engine noise was heard again but we saw nothing.   Seeing the UFO didn&#39;t scare us though, and we both said it made us feel at peace in the moment like it was not there to harm us.  Neither of us were under the influence of drugs.<n>

It was an average night for astronomy, nothing amazing, as the moon&#39;s light was blocking out most of the good views. All of a sudden, the computer that controls my telescope went dead. I pulled out my cell phone. It was dead also. Even my watch wasn&#39;t ticking. Then, i heard this odd whistling noise. I looked up, and there was a bright blue triangle traversing the sky at what i would guess to be about 600 mph(just a guess). I sat there watching it for about 10-20 secs before it sped up(no sonic boom) and disappeared from sight. What gets me about what I saw is that it is eerily similar to the reports of november 2006 of the statewide balls of light. Just like the other(which i saw, submitted a report, but it was deleted for some reason) it made a sound, it left a trail, and there was a haze around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Viewed 2 bright orange lights.  Moved independently and then in formation.  Left object moved very slowly north to south.   Right object moved to slowly to the WNW and then stopped and moved toward the left object.  Then both moved slowly in unison to the SW for 2 minutes then stopped.   The right one faded quickly as if pulling away into the distance and disappeared.  The left one faded slowly as if into the distance until was also gone.   The 2 bright orange objects were witnessed by my wife and I.   By the time my mother-in-law left came outside the house, she witnessed only the one remaining orange light go dim and dissappear.   Initially the lights were extremely bright, brighter than an airplane.  There was no blinking or secondary lights.  No sound.   The organge color of the lights and the fact they were not moving was what initially caught my eye.  Wife caught pictures of one of the lights on a small digital camera but it doesn&#39;t give indication to much other than the color of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly it stopped,darted quickly around in a semi circle, stopped still again,turned a complete right angle then went on its way and dissapeared. Definately not a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The hill was a steep uphill climb so I could afford to take a good look while driving uphill. I estimate it was perhaps 50,000 ft because of the type of clouds that it was travelling above. I quickly realised that it was no ordinary aeroplane because the speed it was reavelling and the length and width of the object, which at first appeared to me to be a trail but I soon realised that it was very opaque silver/white, very long, cigar shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fortunately I knew the road ahead lay almost exactly in line with the direction the object was travelling and that I would have a clear view of the flatland ahead once I reached the top of the hill, so I asked my passangers to get the camera phones ready.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon reaching and traversing the crest of the hill I pulled the car over to the side of the road so that my passangers could take a steady shot. By this time the object had travelled very far ahead, I&#39;d estimate around 10 miles in a matter of a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aware that the object would soon be passing over a Royal Air Force base and Civil Airport, I observed the object intensly and wondered if the Air Force and Airport controllers were tracking it on Radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my passangers was able to capture two photographs showing the object with reasonable clarity with a wide view of the countryside. Considering that the object had travelled from directly overhead to the horizon by the time we could get cameras ready and the car stopped in a good spot, I think these photos show an accurate indication as to the size, altitude and speed of the object. It was travelling West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a three minute interval between the two photographs, simply because my passanger had to delete some old pictures from her phone to make room in the phones memory in order to take the second shot, but this actually helps see the path of the object if you consider the first point of sighting to be almost directly overhead and slightly to the left of both pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of minutes after the second picture was taken the object had traversed the entire sky and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was sprinkling rain on &amp; off that day. I was headed through a coffee shop drive through when out of the corner of my eye i saw a dark black dome shaped objest slowly lowered out of the clouds. It lowered no farther than just below the cloud cover, just enough to be fully exposed. I couln&#39;t beleive what i was seeing. I aksed the coffee girl to take a look, she was as stunned as i was. We had no clue what we were looking at, I have never in my life seen anything like this. It didn&#39;t make any sudden moves or any noise that we could hear. I estimate it was the size of a large s.u.v. in diameter. and 10-15 feet tall. The clouds were very low so really is wans&#39;t too far off the ground, just enough to get a really good look at it. It gave me chills to see it. The objest just hovered for about 10 seconds before slowly rising and disapearing into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a green streak of light dropping below the broken cloud cover it was flickering in intensity and saw small white light fragments breaking away and dropping out below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said ohh, ohh, ohh, and was pointing toward it when the green light disapeared and my sister and friend looked where I was pointing. The green streak of light appeared again, but brighter then before. The green light had changed direction and as it started to climb in altitude it start to excelerate. the green streak was like a cheap special effect from the movie TRON and didn’t look like anything burning, but like it was bleeding off steadly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time all of us were staring at the object. It was now visible thru the front windshield of the truck by me and it was rising at an angle of about 30 degrees when there was a whitish flash and then it started slowing down and dropping altitude again. it was flickering in intensiity then the light just went out. This all took place with in a span of 6 or 7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I stared at it and noticed that it was greenish and had a red trail behind it then it just stopped and now was green with a red trail but it was not shaped like a star... it kinda looked like a visor on top then a straight line to a diamond shape middle with a straight line below it then IT JUST DISAPPEARED.  Seriously, it was falling like a shooting star at first then just stopped in mid air for a couple of seconds and that was it, lights out... it was gone and the sky was dark again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not saying it was a flying saucer or anything but I do know it was not a shooting star ... don&#39;t know what it was but I definately say something.<n>

My exact location was about the 32 mile marker southwest of Salome at the I-10/US 60 interchange. I had been visually scanning the sky since I left my fuel stop in Quartzite because the night was clear and I like to spot meteorites. The section of the sky I saw the UFO in, I had scanned 6 to 7 seconds prior and there was nothing there. I was looking straight ahead, at the sky and road in front of me, when a bright light caught my eye to my left. I had the window rolled down, and was able to immediately dismiss it as a reflection from lights I sometimes see on my right that are reflected off the driver side window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling at tremendous speed in a north east direction at a 40 degree declination off the horizon. At first I dismissed the object as falling space debris because of the blue color of the corona around a bright white center. But when the object disappeared, I thought different. Let me explain why. Normally space debris, or meteorites, after entering or burning up in the atmosphere fade out quickly as they cool or loose enough material to no longer burn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In comparison with a Aries V rocket launch I witnessed being launched from Vandenburg Air force Base last Thursday morning, It is my belief that what I saw was not a vehicle entering the atmosphere but leaving. I went to a hilltop, about 3 miles from the rocket launch, to recorded it High Definition Video. From 3 miles away I could see the rocket very clearly. The UFO was traveling twice as fast as the Aries rocket did, and was 3 to 4 times larger in it’s brightness, at a distance of to 20 to 25 miles or more. The distance was figured by the moon lit silhouette of the mountain range to the north and under the UFO. It’s path was in a north east direction headed away from me, and just before it disappeared the brightness intensified for about one second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel confidant, with my experience in the military, and my knowledge of aircraft, that this was a vehicle that was traveling at a high altitude and only showed itself when it needed to reach escape velocity. The total view time was only 3 ½ to 4 seconds, and was a beautiful white round burst of energy surrounded by a blue corona of light. It left no contrail, but did leave a short trail of light that followed it closely. It made no discernible noise, my big rig was too noisy to hear it if it did. In comparing it’s size with the half full moon this night, it was large enough to cover half of that. It was an awesome display of power and technology.<n>

My friend and I were talking when my dog started crying. I figured he wanted to go outside so me and my friend took him for a walk. We brought him over by an abandoned house and he stopped. No matter what I did he wouldn’t budge. That’s when my friend pointed out an object in the sky.  It was northwest of where we were standing. It had three white lights in each corner of the craft. There was also a red aura emanating from it. I was in the air force and am used to seeing aircrafts, but this is something I had never seen before. I’m even fond of the crafts they are developing today and couldn’t recognize this craft. It sat in the air, motionless for about 10 minutes from what my friend and I saw, and then shot off at unbelievable speed. I could not believe my eyes, and was scared to talk about it to anybody. My friend and I kept it to ourselves until now. You are the first to hear this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were what looked like to be a mixture of orange and purple. The rectangle also had a funnel shaped object on top, sort of like a funnel to a tornado siren.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was at my girlfriends house and it was a school night she lived aproximatly 30 mins from my house.  So having a curfew of 23:30, I would leave her house at exactly 23:00 every night. I left on time that night traveling south bound on St Rt 62 from Mt Alto, WV, Headed towards Hatrford, WV. I was on time so I was traveling the posted speed of 55 mph, give or take a few.  As I headed into the area known as &amp;quot;Brinker Hollow&amp;quot; I saw a large bright light in front of me at the tree line. I&#39;m a vol. firefighter so I knew it wasn&#39;t healthnets helicopter I would have heard them on my radio. It was so bright that I remember rolling down my driver side window and starting to come to a halt. From my memory I heard no noise, just saw that bright light. The next thing I remember my phone is ringing and I&#39;m about 2 miles south of where I saw the bright light. It was my father yelling at me asking me why I wasn&#39;t home. I made up a quick story that ! wasn&#39;t believable. I saw on my phone that aproximatly 40 mins of my time had disapeared. I had multipal missed calls from my girlfriend and from my dad.  For the longest time that night was just stashed away in my past although now I am having vivid dreams of the missing 40 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was coming towards me completely silent about the same height that a private plane would fly.  As I stopped to watch, it came and hovered over me. In complete shock, I put my arm up to shield my eyes from the light to get a better look, but couldn&#39;t see anything. After hovering over me, it quietly resumed flight. After a few seconds, it stopped again (this time some distance away) and dropped two smaller orange orbs from it&#39;s bottom. Both orbs disappeared before hitting the ground. The craft then suddenly moved away quietly as I ran down the sloped street I was on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got to the bottom, I looked back, only to see that the craft was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I had just turned onto 51st Ave from Indian School Road and had travel about 200 feet.  I had my radio on, and it was playing rather loudly.  Over the sound of the music, I thought I heard a ‘pop’ or a ‘rumble’, and looked up into the night sky.  It was dark and cloudy.  From behind me, up in the sky, a very bright green light shot through the sky, also going southbound, and traveled very far and very fast.  I have never seen anything move that fast.  This entire incident lasted less than two seconds.  I would estimate that it went as far as South Mountain before disappearing in the sky.  The green light was about the size of a dime coin if I was to hold it above me against the windshield, and did not get much smaller than that in overall size as it moved away from me.  There was no tail, no trailing smoke or anything one might associate with a meteorite.  It was not a solid ball of light; it had points of light, like a star in the sky.  It moved incredibly fast, in a straight line, it did not arc towards the earth; it remained elevated in the sky, and disappeared in the distance like a light going out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was fascinating and beautiful to see.  It was incredibly fast, and from the distance that I estimate it traveled, I don’t think we have anything publicly known that can travel that fast.  I believe other people in cars behind me saw this as well.  I suspect it was a meteorite, but it was just an awesome sight, and cannot explain the lack of an arc or a tail if it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned and saw a large, bright, red, glowing object that looked like a fireball or an orb. It was a few miles away and made no sound and it was slowly floating downwards for a second before it just disappeared. I told my family and no one believed me. After a few minutes of them telling me that they didn&#39;t believe me, I started to question whether I had actually seen it because it was for such a short amount of time. The next morning I turned on the local radio and they were saying that people reported seeing UFOs in Mexico the day before. I am sure that it wasn&#39;t a meteorite or anything of that nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I saw the craft it was sometime between one and two o’clock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was riding my skate board down the street to friends a house also I live in the mountains and on my street is an opening with a view of most of southern California from San Bernardino to the beach.  So as I was riding I stopped to look at the view for a little while when I saw a reflection of something in the mountains on the horizon kind of by the beach.  At first I thought it was the reflection of a car driving it was moving slow at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I decided to watch it and try to figure out what it was at this time still thought it was a car until I saw it move off the mountain and it was in mid air.  When this happened, I thought oh maybe it’s a helicopter all I could see was a reflection still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I continued watching it when all of the sudden boom it shot from the beach to the bottom of Mount Wilson which from where it came from was about a 1 ½ hour to 2 hour trip in a car. When that happened I could see exactly what the craft looked like it was a sphere about half the size of a jet liner with a white metallic on it and a rectangular black door or something on the front.  All it did was go back and forth from where it came from to the bottom of the mountain and incredible speeds almost instantaneously after about 5 minutes of this it shot out over to the beach and disappeared over the horizon of the Pacific Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never knew where to report this until now that’s why its taken me so long to report it happened! in 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

After about 25 seconds, it looked as though it had a flame behind it, and then suddenly exploded like a puff of red smoke or a tiny firework.  There was no residual smoke - only a bright flash and outward poof - and then nothing at all. At one point it looked as though it was heading right for us. I would say it was about two to three miles away when it exploded. There was no sound. Freaked us all out.<n>

All of a sudden it was getting brighter, at the same time the power went out in our area and this small light erupted in a bright flash of blue light, it looked as if night was transformed into day. The explosion of light went outward instead of upward. As soon as the bright flash happened the power came right back on. Almost as if something sucked up all the electricity for the explosion of light because the electricity came back on ASAP. That doesn&#39;t happen if it is being worked on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They are both like oval shaped beam lights, but with no source, and they are moving independently from the other.   They are going from left to right and moving diagonally.  They have so far been there for about half an hour and are still there.  They look to be in the distance, miles away, but can be clearly seen nevertheless.  Our neighbour drew them to our attention.  We told another neighbour and together we have watched them for some minutes.  We keep checking from the window and they are still there.  We don&#39;t know who to contact about them and this is the only place we&#39;ve found, but you&#39;re too far away!  Still, at least they&#39;re reported now.

I walked outside and noticed a red, green, blue and white strobe like flash a few hundred feet off the ground to my left as soon as i walked into his driveway.  I stood still afraid I was going to miss something as it flew in front of the moon where i saw what looked like an egg or almond shape with a solid thin line of exhaust that disappeared a couple hundred feet behind it.  The top half of the craft appeared to be a light grid that flashed a spectrum of colors like I had never seen before.  After it passed I ran and grabbed my friend, he saw it but it was too far away to tell what it was.  I went home and saw 2 dim yellowish lights in the distance at about 4:15 A.M.  I ran inside and grabbed my mother out of bed and over the course of about 15 mins 5 crafts flew over us.  First 2, then 2 more, then 1 about 5 minutes apart from each other.  The last one that passed over our driveway made a sound like I had never heard before, like a call or a signal.  I believe it acknowledged that we were seeing it.  It did the same call twice which sounded like a hawk&#39;s call mixed with a whistling bottle rocket, but it sounded digital.  Like eeeyyyeeerrr  eeeee. My mother and I still don&#39;t know what we saw but it would prove to be the first in a series of sightings that still continues.

At approximately 8:28pm, I stepped outside to lock up a conference trailer on my company’s property. After I locked up the trailer and began to walk away, I glanced up towards the moon, almost directly overhead, and I was surprised to see what appeared to be four red lights crossing the sky at a slow but steady pace. I stopped and stared upwards at the lights. They seemed to be traveling from north to south in a straight line. I couldn’t see what the lights were attached to. I couldn’t see the shape of any kind of aircraft. I couldn’t tell how high or how low they were in the sky, however if it was one solid object and it was very high, then that would meen it was very big as well. The lights easily stretched out to cover the sky about ten moons wide. They were also very quiet. If they made any sound, it could have been the sound of a commercial airliner passing at a very high altitude overhead, a very faint and distant sound, although that sound could have easily been confused with the low hum of A/C units on top of a nearby office building as well. I&#39;m not sure the object(s) made any sound at all. The lights did not blink, nor were they were not very bright. They were almost faint in the sky, easy to miss unless you glance up and happened to spot it. They did not have the normal navigation lights you expect to see on any commercial aircraft. There were no strobe lights, no green lights to show what side of the aircraft you might be viewing. They did seem to be traveling to my left, but keep in mind they were practically overhead too. I still should have seen a green light next to each red light if these were planes in formation. It is possible that these were military fighter jets with an different light configuration than what civilians are used to seeing, but these seemed to move slower than I would have expected to see and I actually am used to seeing fighter jets at night. I was in the Navy and lived near Mira Mar in San Diego. I’m used to hearing the jets clear! ly and s eeing a blue light with a white strobe. At least, that’s what I’m used to seeing over the city at night. As I continued to watch the lights, a few moments into observing all this, I realized I might be witnessing a UFO sighting and so I quickly tried to gather any more information I could before the lights flew out of sight. I was too far from my truck to grab my camera. None of the security cameras pointed straight up. I realized my eyes would be the only thing I could rely on to remember this by. My first thought was to look at each light closely. What each light seemed to be was a set of three lights. There were two bright red lights with a white light in the middle. That white light seemed to be dimmer than the red lights by comparison, but also seemed to be on the leading edge of each set. The next thing I tried to determine before it got too far was if what I was seeing was a formation of aircraft or one solid object. I jogged back a few steps until a bright enough star was in it’s path. I stopped when the upper two sets of lights seemed to be getting close to that star. Halfway between the two sets of lights, the star disappeared for a moment. It seemed to me at that point that what I was seeing was one solid chevron shaped object. The whole sighting took maybe 15 to 20 seconds before the lights went over the horizon and behind the building I was standing near. I ran to the far edge of the building to get a few more seconds of viewing, but the lights were too far gone by that point. I could not see any more. I asked around, but I was the only person who saw this. I reported this to the Carlsbad Police Department and to Channel 6 News in San Diego. I will include an image I drew of the sighting. I am 29 years old, Ex-Navy, a trained observer, and I’ve worked at that location, near Palomar Airport, for at least 4 years. I have never seen lights like this, not here or anywhere else for that matter. I&#39;d also like to note that cloud cover moved in later that night and the direction of the wind seemed t! o go aga inst the direction these lights were traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He said that it looked silver, but he is not exactly sure and that you could see the windows and the sun was giving a glare on it. He and his brothers were watching an airplane way up in the sky, he didnt really know why the airplane caught there attention, but then out of no where an object appeard and then it was gone. It was higher than the airplane and the airplane was about as high as one can get. The object was way bigger and it looked like it was gonna hit the plane, but it was above the plane. He said it was only there for a few seconds, about 4, and poof, it was gone. He said it was like it just vanished into thin air. It was the coolest thing that he ever saw and if it were not for his two brothers who also seen it, he said it would be hard for even him to believe!!!<n>

At first I thought it was someones special effects launch like a Sky Lantern round and brightly colored reddish orange like the color of Mars in the sky but as I directed my friends attention to the object we noticed that it began to move from west to east staying consistent in color and brightness. There were no clouds a slight breeze and was very clear. As we watched it move I noticed and confirmed this with my friend that there was a faint short very fine orange mist particle trail behind it. I have seen many meteorites of all shapes and sizes and have seen space debris burn up upon earths re-entry. I have seen all types of missiles and rockets and it wasn&#39;t a helicopter or any kind of current aircraft I have ever seen. This was none of the above! We watched as the device moved across the early morning night sky for approx 3 Min&#39;s. It for a moment became brighter and turned slightly whiteish then disappeared in the lower middle of the sky. It re-appeared approx. 15-20 sec later at it&#39;s last location for about 30 sec then disappeared again. We continued to watch for it to re-appear but never did again. Around 5 Min&#39;s later there was a sonic boom! About 3 Min&#39;s after the object disappeared there was a commercial passenger jet approaching from the northwest heading towards where we last seen the object. The sonic boom cam 2 Min&#39;s after the jet. But I know for a fact that it did not come from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if they were able to see this object? What was it?<n>

As I approached the city I could see lights in the sky.  There were 3 lights on each object 2 white and 1 green.  There were a lot of objects in the sky.  Aprox. 20 objects.  I looked all around and they were in a grid formation in the sky. They were spaced about 3 miles from each other.  They all sat about 900ft up and didn&#39;t move.  I was in the Air Force and I&#39;ve seen aircraft before.  As I drove more and more showed up. None of them moved.  As I drove further 1 object moved in formation to line up with the others.  Same light pattern as the others. It stopped and I drove out of the city. I called my wife to tell her what happened from the road. I am not crazy. I&#39;ve driven truck for 5 years.  I was in the Air Force for 8 years.  Something was over Loiville, Kentucky that night.<n>

I remember waking up in a cold sweat from a dream that was very freighting.  The dream was of my dad’s execution in a king’s court by beheading.  I remember waking up afraid that my dad was dead.  I then composed myself realizing it was a dream.  The way I got up on the couch I was sitting facing his windows.  All of a sudden I saw that the yard was illuminated with white light as if their was a emergency vehicle outside.  I then got up to look out the window and was frozen to see a saucer like craft with lights going all the way around it in a circle.  It moved very slow just above the tree tops.  I would say about 2 to 3 stories up, I could have thrown a baseball and hit it.  No sound was being made and I watch not able to move as it went down the road.  I got the feeling of needles pricking my skin all over and my heart raced.  When I could no longer see the craft I started thinking that maybe I was dreaming so I pinched myself and it hurt so I concluded that I was not.  I then turned to my dad who was sleeping and tried to wake him up, being like he always was he told me to shut up and go to bed.  I couldn’t though and I laid back on his couch all night until the next morning.  Since that night my life has changed in ways that I can’t get over.  I have since developed sleep paralysis in which I tend to astral project and sometimes feel like I am being carried off.  I became a music prodigy on the guitar and piano.  I have psychic feelings.  I also use to have a reoccurring dream that I am hovering over a coffin that is violently shaking, it opens, and a grey is laying there with its arms crossed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

For about a minute it then abruptly started to move west and then it changed course abruptly moving east  and then just stayed in its position. For about 15 seconds it then drifted again east traveling up in a higher elevation By this time I pulled over and someone else behind me pulled over and we got out of our cars at the same time. We both were trying to figure out what it was. The most acurate part to what  we both saw was that there was about three planes coming in different directions coming towards each other so comparing the way it moved and looked was very much different compared to the planes we were looking at in the sky. The planes in the sky had blinking lights like every plane does at night and this craft did not.  The craft then again moved straight up in elevation then  stayed in its position for another 30 seconds and disappeared in the direction of space. Me and this person I have never met stayed by the street and  looked to see if it would reappear, it didn&#39;t. But for the next 30 minutes there seemed to be a lot of  airplane activity in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We went outside for a smoke break on a cloudy and drizziling night. We soon noticed up in the sky a moderately bright red light which lit up the haze around it. It was intense enough to light the street up as well due to the water on the roadway. it had the exact same appearance in intensity and height as a radio or water tower mounted with a red light would on such a hazy night. However I know the area well. There is no such tower in the area, just a farm field, so this light which made no noise is unexplainable. after 3-4 min it began to fluctuate and dim until it disappeared as mysteriously as it had appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Drum military base. The skies are always lit up with something going over and I am very familiar with all the planes and flares, and many exercises they perform during the year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I though it was a helicopter but after a few minutes I noticed it was not moving and there was no noise at all. The light was very bright like a strobe light, flashing very quickly.It was just above the tree line, if i had to guess i would say about a mile away not very high up.the size was about the same as the street lights that are around our complex if that makes any sense to you.Yet it was about a mile away so i can`t guess the size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> anyways i kept looking atit and it just stayed in the one position pulsing very quickly, my binoculars were downstairs and i wanted to get the but i was afraid when i got back it would be gone, went down anyways and got back and it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When i focused in on the light i was amazed at what i saw!!  it was swirling colors, light pinks, blues, yellows oranges, all i can liken it to is pictures of thee Northern lights i have seen,  the shades if you can picture them condensed into a small sphere, it was the most beautiful thing i have ever seen in my life!  Yet when i looked at the light with a naked eye you could see no colors at all!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 7-8 minutes it started to move off to the east I followed with my binoculars until i could see it no more. Total duration was 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have for weeks gone through all your reports and a lot of other reporting stations and could not find anything similar to what I saw.  I have checked all militery flare sites which dont relly have many good pictures and I have talked to military personal here in the complex and they had never heard of any flares like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have checked into entertainment strobe lighting, ball lightning, swamp gas, holograms, lazers, i have gone the gambit, just nothing i can compare it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully somebody else has seen this and can answer my question!  What was it?!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think about it all the time and its driving me nuts not knowing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name eleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. i am ((deleted)) years old.<n>

He said there were strange lights outside and that they had been moving around the northern end of the valley from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside while still on the phone with my nephew and he said look to the WNW and we both saw one large lone reddish-blue silver light glistening in the WNW Sky. It appeared to be 3-5 miles away, however I am not certain. He said he and his father had been observing for longer and said more would appear, that they had been visible and then not, just then one light appeared and then several seconds later another appeared then several seconds later a third light appeared. These three lights were in a near perfect triangle, not an isosceles but flatter with approximate 45-degree angles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They remained that way for maybe 30 seconds with all four lights glistening the same sharp reddish-blue silver light. The fourth light appeared closer because of its brightness also it was positioned higher and to the left of the triangular formation of lights. The lights appeared to hover and move very slowly to the left, keeping their same distance from me. The lights forming the triangle then vanished into the westward sky and left the remaining fourth light that slowly drifted to the left and west over the horizon of mountains. No sound was ever heard form these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ten minutes later a large plane came from the ESE and crossed directly over and directly in line with the west ward direction of the lights until out of sight. This plane had a deep roar of motors had no normal colored airline lights, but several large yellowish orange lights marking its body. Not sure if plane was in support of the light formation or in search or niether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do not know if lights were military training or just what they were.  All I know for sure is lights were very unique in appearance and behavior of any thing I have ever witnessed in nearly 50 years of living in this area.<n>

Shortly after i got home i walked out front of my second story apartment complex to smoke a cigeratte near the steps. Just about as soon as I lit the cigeratte i was dumfounded to see what appeared to be a strange looking craft come from nowhere flying at fairly low altitude with no sound. The sun had just began to rise so i got a fairly good look at the description of the craft. It appeared to be a disk shaped craft with some sort of tail (or propulsion) at the back end of the craft? The craft was traveling somewhat faster than a commercial aircraft would be normally traveling, and quickly was passing slightly overhead of the apartment. I tried to gain another look at the craft so i ran through my apartment to the back porch to get another look. I could still see the craft in the distance, but at this point it looked pretty far away. As i continued to watch this craft for another 10 minutes or so in the distance, i noticed that it seemed to jump or something when it appeared to be hovering. At first i thought i had lost sight of the ufo so i began to scan the sky. I caught the ufo once again with my eyes, and seen it lighting up a strange orangish color for only a spilt second to see it jump all over a specific area like it was struggling to stay airborne. The craft was hard to follow but i sat on my back porch watching this thing for at least 10-15 minutes until i finally lost sight. The second craft i saw was far away i never saw it close. But it appeared to be hovering near a cloud for the whole time i witnessed the original craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It disappeared immediately. My heart was beating so fast and I had no idea what I had just witnessed.

3/10/08 21:15|Little Rock/Maumell|AR|Unknown|1 minute|Horizontal row of lights seen from a bridge over the Arkansas river, which changed configuration to a vertical column and disappeared|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62207.html|228|ndxe200803| Horizontal row of lights seen from a bridge over the Arkansas river, which changed configuration to a vertical column and disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on I-430 northbound across the bridge over the Arkansas river when I noticed a horizontal group of lights several hundred, perhaps as much as two thousand, feet in the sky above some trees on the right side (relative to the freeway I was driving on) of the northern coast.  All the lights were the same color, a bright white with a tinge of yellow.  They were four or five circular-shaped lights very close together so they almost appeared as one bar of light.  None of the lights blinked or changed color.  I was watching it for a little less than a minute when suddenly all the lights disappeared and a new set appeared in a vertical formation, bisecting the horizontal set of lights if they had remained visible.  The change occurred while I was watching and there was no smooth transition: the horizontal lights simply disappeared as the vertical lights appeared.  The vertical lights were the same color, intensity, and spacing as the horizontal lights, with each light just far enough apart from the next that they did not appear to be a solid bar of light like a fluorescent or neon tube.  Shortly after the vertical lights appeared, within a second or two, the top light quickly became much brighter.  A few seconds later, the vertical lights disappeared leaving only blackness.  The vertical lights were only visible for about five seconds before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time the lights were visible, just over a minute, they were completely stationary.  Had the lights been on at the same time, they would have resembled a cross (+).  There&#39;s no way the lights could have been attached to a radio tower or any other antenna.  I&#39;ve made the same commute from Little Rock to Jacksonville almost every night for several years and am very familiar with all stationary land beacons.  Partially due to my familiarity with the drive and the fact that the bridge across the river is completely straight, I could devote a lot of attention to the lights.  It was too dark to make out a shape of whatever the lights were attached to.  Unfortunately, the night was too black and the lights too bright for me to make out any kind of shape the lights may have been attached to.  I never heard any sounds from the lights as I was driving on the freeway around 65 Mph in a cheap, poorly sealed car.  Because of this, it was impossible for me to conclude if the lights made any sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that for number of craft seen, I&#39;ve selected 1-10: as few as one if the lights were all connected to one craft, and as many as 10 if each light was attached to its own craft.  I remain unsure of if there were four or five lights comprising the horizontal row and vertical column as I could barely make out the shape of each light.  However, I&#39;m positive one of the numbers is correct.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
3/10/08 21:00|Goodlettsville|TN|Unknown|5 min|Slow moving odd shaped object flying on hitt lane in goodlettsville, tn|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63575.html|229|ndxe200803| Slow moving odd shaped object flying on hitt lane in goodlettsville, tn<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving down Hitt lane heading towards Old Dickerson Pike. Upon Turning onto the road from Brick Church Pike, my passenger and I witnessed a slow moving craft just above the tree line. At first, it seemed as if it was car headlights on top of a hill (there is a hill that you are facing as soon as you turn onto Hitt lane from brick church pike). As i drove closer to the hill, it turns beside it with a tree line to the right(in the direction that i was moving). The lights i saw ontop of the hill had moved down the hill towards me. I looked up out of my driver side window, and i saw an odly shaped craft that was moving slower that me, it seemed, in the opposite direction. My window was down and the radio was not turned on. This said, i heard no noise personally. Again, this object with lights was not shaped like anything that i have wittnessed. It was only 50 feet (at most) above my head. The best way that i can describe this is a craft with rounded backward wings. it had a spade like tail. I wish i could draw something on this description to help. It was not like my normal idea of what a space ship would look like. The most important aspect to make me believe that it was something Unidentified is the fact that it was only above the tree line, Moving extemely slow (i think slower than 40 mph), and most of all, it made no noise. (even a helicopter would have been loud at that altitude). To be honest, it freaked me out a bit. So, i didn&#39;t stick around to see which way it went. But It headed towards brick church pike when i drove off. I don&#39;t remember the exact date, but i know it was between saint patrick&#39;s day and the end of march.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

At 7:54 pm there were three of us driving in a car northbound on Pueblo Blvd. heading out toward Highway 50. I remember the time exactly because before we saw the ufo I looked at the clock in the car because we were supposed to call a friend some time after 8:15 and pick him up. We were heading out to another friend&#39;s house for a quick visit. The house we were heading to at the time was an apartment complex with a locking gate that requires a keycode for entry, at least at that time of night, though I&#39;m not sure because I&#39;ve only been there once. I think to get there you take one of the last right turns as you head from the city park on Pueblo Blvd. over a bridge that goes over the Arkansas River, which we&#39;ve also seen different looking ufos over. As we pulled in to the apartment complex, we could see Highway 50 across a small field, maybe a few hundred feet away to a car dealership with al of it&#39;s parking lot lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, after we had crossed the river heading out to these apartments, we saw a few small radio antennas of some sort with a single red blinking light on the top of each, and further in the distance larger, much taller antennas with red blinking lights. They&#39;re landmarks out there, and when you see one of these at night, the same one you&#39;ve driven past over and over at night, you know what&#39;s a radio tower and what&#39;s not. Between the smaller towers closer to us, and the taller towers much further ahead of us, was an oval shaped light (like a cirlce, but with a flat top and bottom). Judging by the mile markers, it was a little more than a quarter mile away when we first saw it, but it was off to our right, about 7-8 stories above the ground. It emitted a red light similar to the lights on the radio towers, but this light was bigger, the whole &#34;craft&#34;, and was a brighter, slightly pink-tinted red light. We could not see a definite outline of a craft, just a light. The light! coming  from it seemed somewhat constant, but the way the glare shifted and points of intensity in the light shifted rapidly with much energy, it seemed like a plasma of some sort. And I don&#39;t mean like some hippy lighting effect show, I mean like looking at a plasma light bulb in which the light seems constant in it&#39;s intensity, but slightly grainy, and without the glass to hold the plasma and dull it&#39;s intensity. The light seemed to have been travelling the same direction and speed that we were. Just before we came to our turn off, the light began to descend to between 5-6 stories, leaving a semi-vertical steam or smoke trail. When it finished descending to between 5-6 stories off the ground, the  emission of the steam trail ceased and the light dissappeared. The craft descended and disappeared within just a few hundred feet of the apartment we were headed to, as we were driving just beneath this steam trail as it floated south along with the wind and descended to the ground with the wind so that the bottom of th steam trail was about 2-3 stories off the ground, and not even 60 ft. from our vehicle as we were driving out to the apartment. We heard no sound from the craft, but we were driving so if there were a faint noise we wouldn&#39;t have heard it. It was not an airplane or helicopter, military or civilian, as we have both that fly over Pueblo and especially in that area. We would&#39;ve heard the rotors had it been helicopter, as it was travelling about 60mph northbound, following Pueblo Blvd. but off the the right as you approach Highway 50. It was not an airplane, as we would&#39;ve heard the engines and no airplane I know of in use can travel 60 mph and even slow down as it descends to 5-6 stories without crashing. Besides that, this was one solid pink light that gave off a steam trail lower than 100ft. The steam trail, and I say that because it was light and not dark like smoke, was almost vertical, but you could tell that the craft descended rapidly, almost vertically, but while still travelling north. I don&#39;t ! know if  it dropped off it&#39;s horizontal speed while it descended because we weren&#39;t close enough to it to tell, we only drove up right under it&#39;s steam trail. I almost wish we&#39;d had some sort of air sensor on a long pole, because we could&#39;ve sampled the steam trail we were so close to it. If I had to put an approximate size on this ufo, I&#39;d say about 1 and 1/3 as tall as an SUV and as wide as 2 SUV&#39;s are long. It appeared to be round all around, with a flatter top and bottom, but we only saw it from one angle as it was travelling the same direction we were at about the same speed. As to the weather on this night, it was nice out, but getting pretty chilly because I wished I&#39;d had my sweater with me. There were no clouds in the sky and it was probably about 40 degrees F.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/10/08 13:30|Las Vegas|NV|Light|10 minutes|UFO's practicing with the Thunderbirds?|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62202.html|232|ndxe200803| UFO&#39;s practicing with the Thunderbirds?<n> <n><n> <n><n> While eating lunch and watching the Thunderbirds practicing over Nellis AFB, I was at the north end of Hollywood Blvd, which dead ends into Nellis AFB. I watched the Thunderbirds go through practice routines at about the 10:00 position and I noticed small white objects at the 1:30 position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was that these were random pieces of paper caught in the updraft of a while wind (or dust devil). I have witnessed this before. These &#34;papers&#34; were very high in altitude, and hardly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I looked back at the 10:00 position to watch the Thunderbirds do a low altitude pass over.  As I was eating I looked back to the 1:30 position to see these objects slowly moving to the NE, and I noticed that there were 6 of these objects; the thought that these could be geese flying back north, and I wondered if there was any danger that the aircraft could hit them.  I observed the objects for about 20 seconds, and noticed that the were not flying in any formation and there movement was very slow to the NE. My eyes went back to the 10:00 position, the Thunderbird were doing their 4 aircraft going vertical and spreading out at the apex of their climb, and noticed that the objects were in the same area of the apex of the aircraft. I quickly looked back to the 1:30 position and nothing was there. Then as I looked back, the objects were closer together, moving up and down slightly, and then proceeded to travel to the NW until they went out of sight. Immediately the Thunderbirds landed in a rapid procession.<n>

The first boom occurred at 10:00 and the next at 11:04 and sometimes there is a third or fourth sound. It is scary because the entire building structure feels as though it is moving.

Flying through the sky at a very slow rate of speed was what appeared to be a green stream of light that was moving in a manner that made it seem alive and not a craft. It was flying no more than 20-30 feet above me due east for approximately 30-40 seconds when a spark of light materialised at the head of the stream and seemed to reveal a vague ring shape with bright white flamelike sparks of light emanating from inside the outer portion of the ring towards the center and right before the sparks met in the middle the whole thing dissapeared. The object made no sound which was strange to me as it was flying so low. The movement of the object was fluid and slightly undulating which the only way I could make a rational human comparison when I told my wife was that it moved and had a vague physical resemblance to a jellyfish. I have never seen anything like it nor have I ever heard or read of anything like it but since it happened I have found similar sightings reported online.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a firework, or any light abberation or distortion. It was vivid, close and highly visible with more than enough time for me to size it up and find a logical explanation. I would like to know if anyone else saw it that night. I have never seen a ufo and am a rational intelligent person who has never ruled out the possibility of life beyond this world but at the same time never convinced by the limited knowledge of reported sightings and lack of first hand evidence. What I saw changed that for me forever.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I slowed to take a closer look as the sky was beautifully blue and clear and there should have been nothing in that area of sky.  I’ve driven this route for over 10 years and know it well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was an ellipsoidal object lit from beneath by the sun.  It was slowly and noiselessly moving toward the west at, I would estimate, about 10 mph.  It was moving level and in a linear manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was a weather balloon; yea, sure, Uncle.  If so, it would be moving against any prevailing breeze which would be from the west to east.  There was no breeze at ground level that morning.    It did not change shape or direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had it in view for about three to four seconds and watched it move behind an unnamed &#34;hill&#34; which is a small but quite obvious peak from the bottom of the canyon.  On the topographic map the hill is noted at 6897’ in elevation at the top.  I would estimate the object was just below the peak and travelled just south of the peak as the ellipse disappeared &#34;behind&#34; the peak from the canyon bottom and road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Based on the spruce trees on the peak, I would estimate the major axis of the ellipse which was horizontal to be about 25’ to 30’ and the minor axis to be about 1/3 that.  It was clearly lit from below by the early morning sun and appeared the white &#34;color&#34; of the sun, a highly reflective surface which added no spectral modification of its own.  It was totally opaque.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The linear distance from the road, my observation point, to the object was about 0.20 miles.  This is estimated from the topographic map of the area.  If I had been home and looking out the south-facing windows of the house, I would have been looking down on the object and had a much longer sighting Too bad!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just for interest sake, this was by far not my first sighting nor, hopefully, will be my last.

This was in the north Naples, FL area and the whole thing lasted about three seconds.  I don&#39;t scare easily but this really freaked me out!

I started to get the feeling that I was being watched, it creeped me out, and I went and sat down to the side of the parking lot I was in. After a few minutes of sitting down, I began to hear a few dogs barking quite a bit. I eventually got up and left, and started to head home. I live right below the top of a rather large hill, and there is an intersection at the top of the hill. I got to the top of the hill, and non-voluntarily, I looked up to see this bright star-shaped object in the sky. It was the color of a star at first, and it streaked directly across the sky quickly and gracefully. It streaked for a few seconds, and it began to emanate red and green for a second or two, and it disappeared. It almost seemed like it was crashing when the red and green appeared. This was the only object I saw, and it was shaped almost exactly like a star but it seemed too unnatural. I heard the sound of a plane afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, we thought that it was a helium mylar balloon.   Only after watching it for several seconds, were we able to tell, that it wasn&#39;t a balloon.  First, the object was hovering, not moving in any direction; second, the texture was too bright and shiny, like liquid silver, and finally, the shape was too precise to be a balloon.  It was oval in shape, but it seemed to be smaller on top than on the bottom.  From the angle that we were looking at it, the shape was similar to a kidney bean. We looked at each other and then looked back into the sky, and it was gone.  We are convinced, without a doubt, that what we saw was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us are college educated; he works for one of the largest consultant firms in the country and I am attending college pursuing a  2nd degree in Christian Counseling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So I took some shots with my DigiCam at 85x zoom using night settings. The images were astonishing, it was a circular object with lights at the bottom part and a glow..I took many shots, after around 20-25 mintues the magnitude was fading....I dont know what exactly it was..<n>

It did not morph or change colors- it just sailed across and dissapeared. oh and it did have a tail on it, but dissappeared when the orb dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light did not flicker like a plan or helicopter.  From the glow you could see the shape of the craft that almost looked cross shaped.  The craft hovered in the same position for a few minutes and then disappeared into the sky in the SE direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom then informed me the news from what she saw.  When she was in the backyard is when she saw the object appear from the horizon in the SW, soundless she thought this was odd. The craft lifted up she said and then accelerated to the East.  At that point the craft shot through the sky at an unimaginable rate she said, like firework speed, but from a distance.  When we both saw the object from the front yard she thought it was impossible that something could start and stop in mid flight. Again, I only saw the craft hovering, however this was not a star, helicopter, balloon, or airplane.  I have never seen anything like this and I am sure there has to be other reports. At least I would research the FAA logs to determine if a pilot saw the craft.<n>

3/8/08 20:30|Pembroke Pines|FL|Light|8 seconds|2 lights, possibly the front and back of one object, move in the night sky and vanish as if dimming to naught, in 8 seconds|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62110.html|255|ndxe200803| 2 lights, possibly the front and back of one object, move in the night sky and vanish as if dimming to naught, in 8 seconds<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lying on a blanket, outside, star gazing with the naked eye.  I was just staring at Orion, when off to the left, East, I noted a star with 2 very bright companions.  At first I did a double take - there had been no pair of bright stars there all night, as I had been out since 6:30pm and it was now after 8pm EST.  The lights were separated consistently by the same distance, to an observer, it would be about 200 or 300 ft in length, if it were one object, with a light in the &#39;front&#39; and one in the &#39;back&#39;.  These two lights were separated like stairs, one slightly above the other, but they moved very very slowly, and in tandem, making me think it was one object but its edges were not quite visible to complete its form.  The issue for me, that made me sit up and really stare hard, was the fact that at first, I thought it was a constellation.  I wasn&#39;t even sure it was moving, or they were moving.  Then the distance between the two lights moving together away from a near by star made it apparent.  But the distance between the lights did not alter, nor the -----   ___  stair like separation.  There was no sound, but it was not that close, I would say 10,000 ft up and quite a way off.  There was no blinking or other colors other than white, with a very faint hint of blue on the outside of the white lights.  They moved slowly, much too slowly for a plane, and the lights were about double the size of the nearby star, but brighter by a degree or so than any of the stars in the sky or in nearby Orion.  It moved very slowly from North To South for approximately 8 seconds and then seemed to dematerialize, or slowly dim and shut off.  It did NOT travel far enough to dim due to distance.  Not at all.  And for the last two weeks there has been persistent small aircraft, general aviation Cessna, circling and circling West Lake and points right around my house, like never before, and I am a flight sim buff and can recognize most aircraft.  I don&#39;t know if that has any connection to the lights, but o! ne thing did change.  The aircraft for the last two weeks circled DIRECTLY over my lake, in about a 5 sq. mile circle, approximately 5,000 ft of altitude, unusual for my area, because most general aviation aircraft, A.) are lower, ready to land, or having just taken off from North Perry Airport, 2.5 miles to the southeast of the lake, and B.) traffic slows to the airport after sunset, and after 9pm, I believe only has its facility operating with the tower unmanned.  It is unusual to see a Cessna type aircraft circling for so many hours, sometimes up to 4 hours, and ONLY after sunset.  I thought perhaps it was nighttime IFR training for student Pilots, but I am not sure, because tonight, that plane was about 2 miles further west, and cirlcing.  It circles clockwise for about an hour or so, and then reverses for a couple hours.  Tonight, right after the lights I saw, the craft switched its circular pattern, from Clockwise to Counter-Clockwise, AND it shifted directly over my house, and where I was laying, on a blanket, out in the yard, much closer to where the lights I had seen, had appeared.  The plane directly shifted, right after the lights.  And it stayed in this pattern for another hour or so.  It also shifted in the middle of that time, to the opposite heading, clockwise again.  I have no idea what to think of the plane, other than the lessons theory.  Unless it is an observer flight, or something?  I do not know what I saw, but it had no lights like a plane (no wings, nose, rudder shape), and was so slow, no plane could have stayed up in the sky, it would have stalled.  Furthermore there were no flashing lights and no colored lights.  The light was about twice the size of the star near it, but several times more bright.  And it was silent and moved in tandem, or was one body, with 2 lights.  And it evaporated, dimmed rapidly and was no more.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed at it, and told my friends “what the f*** is that… Holy sh*t”. We just gazed at it for about 15 seconds, just perplexed. We tried to make sense of it, saying its birds. But birds don’t glow orange at night. We realized we’ve seen something incredible, unbelievable and eerie at the same time. Gave me chills. There were somewhere between 15 and 20 saucer like objects with bulges in the center and they had a dim orange glow. The objects were south of us when we saw them.  It was very unnatural how they moved. They were staying still, then moving together at the same time, and somehow :swarming.&#34;  I’m not really sure how they left, they just kind of disappeared.

I will email the image to &#34;ufocntr@nwlink.com&#34;  It was a typical spring day in early March 2008. The day started out very pleasant, then just after mid day we had a storm roll through. I remember this storm quite well, because we had a fair amount of Thunder and Lighting, which seemed scared my 2 yr old son. The loud cracking of the thunder prompted him to run over and ask that I hold him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the storm had passed my wife took our Dogs out for some potty time, but when she came back into the house she said &#34;You have to see this rainbow outside&#34;. Much like anyone else this got me curious, so I walked out onto the deck to see this brilliant rainbow. It was the only rainbow I had ever seen that was entirely complete. At that time I decided I should snap some pictures of it, as I thought a complete rainbow was pretty cool to see. I walked around our house just taking random snapshots of the rainbow hoping that I could get an angle that showed the entire thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days had passed and I decided to dump the pictures off of my digital camera onto my computer. After the process was complete I starting trolling through the pictures that I had taken over the past couple of weeks, and then noticed the rainbow pictures in thumbnail view. I opened the first of about 10 or 15 photos I had taken of the rainbow and started looking at them. When I reached the 3rd photo in the sequence I noticed a bright light under the left side of the arch. My initial thought is that it was simply the sun peering through the clouds. So I zoomed in closer to the anomaly on the pic and immediately said WTF is that! I quickly called my wife over to take a look at this and her response was the same. I was a bit perplexed because I did not see this when I was taking the photos. After further review we noticed that there looked like there was another one of the same objects just right of the center under the rainbow, but it was clearly too far away to be sure. At this point we definitely thought what we were looking at was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you can see in the photo there are 3 or 4 individual round objects (lights) that appear to be emitting this bright white light from the UFO, or whatever it actually is. Also, by the length of the light trail, coupled with the fact that they are so large in the middle of a sunny day looks as though this object is moving up and to the left at a pretty impressive speed. Again, I did not see this at the time I was taking the picture, which leads me to think that this &#34;UFO&#34; was moving very fast, faster than the rate of capture by the human eye, and my camera just happened to catch one single frame during its travel. I really do not know... Take a look at the photo yourself and let me know what you think?  Also, for your reference I was facing north east and the sun was behind me, as it was late in the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had my binoculars with me (if it weren’t for the binoculars, I wouldn’t have seen this object.)  I was viewing a large plane with them that was high in the sky (either a Boeing 767 or 777).  As I was following it, then it happened.  The time was approx. 2:50 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted this weird looking circle craft in the sky (it looked like it was supposed to be a disk) but it was changing because the outline of the craft had wrinkles in it.  It continued to make these weird outlines by wrinkling the outline of the craft.  The craft had no sound (that’s the common thing for all UFOs).  The color looked like a silver color.  The size, well, if it was on the edge of space, then it must have been something pretty massive for me to only see with my binoculars.  I checked the binoculars for debris, but none was present.  It wasn’t a reflection because this “craft” entered my binoculars.  I am familiar with the way weather balloons look in the sky (perfectly circle, white, going up pretty fast).  But this was no weather balloon.  It wasn’t a perfect circle or completely white.  It was what I said up there.  I also know it was not a shopping bag because even a slight bit of wind could not carry it that high or keep it hovering like that.  It was way up there because when the plane passed by it, then the object was behind the plane.  It came from behind the plane (not by itself, but by the plane moving).  I took the binoculars off my eyes, and I couldn’t see the object with my naked eye.  I tried to find it again, but I lost the object.  It wasn’t a balloon because later, for another 10 seconds, I saw it.  A balloon wouldn’t stay for another 15 minutes (I had come outside later).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, at approx. 3:15PM (25 minutes later), I went back outside and looked in the sky with my binoculars at another, smaller airliner.  The smaller airliner was just as high as the other plane was earlier.  The object came into the screen again, only this time, much higher.  It was in the same spot as it was earlier.  It was doing pretty much the same things as it was earlier.  It looked like it was slowly but surely going up.  The sighting ended after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never thought that I would see anything like this.  I have heard many things on the news, but I didn’t believe some of them.  I did, however, see the Stephenville, Texas sightings in January on the news.  I believed it.  The only thing that made it hard to believe was when the object returned, they reported 2 noisy fighter jets chasing the noiseless, triangular craft at high speeds.  I don’t know if that part is true.  I have believed in UFOs ever since I was younger.  What made me believe in them was when I heard about a case on the news or something.  I believe that some of them are either ET, angels, or something like that.  I don’t know why they are here.  If this was a real craft, then this is amazing.  This is all that I have to say about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I began to obseve as I walked and passes a tree that blocked the view of the cream colored one then that one was gone but I felt it was still there, as I looked the other silver one just sat there then it tilted its point downward and took off in a intense speed.  then shortly after that planes started coming from all over. ( regular passanger)  We have a airforce base and airport in between where they were spotted but I feel no craft could go as fast as the silver one was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went with her outdoors. After she finished I picked her up to go inside. As I walked up the back stepped I noticed a large oval object blinking red above the tree line, moving North to South. The red light was toward the front. At first, I thought it was an airplane.  The object was not moving, hovering, above the tree line. As I was watching a green light went on toward the center of the object and started blinking. Two lights were blinking at the same time, a red and green.  I was getting concerned because it was very large and I could not figure out how it stayed in the air and darted so fast and then did a complete stop.  It started to move very slowly, then darted fast toward my direction, now it was moving from West to East, and hovered.  Because I was standing near the back porch light. I thought this object seen me. I backed up in the dark shadows to try and figure it out.. The object seem to hover over the tree line. I got a very concerned, I went in the house Before I went in the object moved again from North to South. I did not hear any noise, it was quiet like it was gliding.  As far as size, it was above the tree line and with New Mexico’s clear skies the stars clearly showed the outline of the object.  Not knowing the exact distance, I thought it was in my neighbors back yard at first above his trees. But it had to be further, 150 to 200 yards, I’m not sure. It just seemed close.<n>

The object then came to a gentle stop at what appeared to be maybe a couple thousand feet up at maybe two or three miles northwest of my house. I instantly grabbed the binoculars and got my wifes attention. Now that the object is stopped it begins to shine red, blue and white but not like a plane. It was changing colors rapidly and it was twice as bright as a plane and the whole object was lit up. As I looked through the binoculars I could clearly see a disk shaped light with very distinct edges. (It looked round to the naked eye.) My wife agreed when she looked at the object. The ufo then began moving gradually to the north and dropped down behind some trees out of our sight. That was the last we saw of the ufo. Our house is in a flight path from dallas so we see planes all night long. My wife and I can assure you this was niether a plane, helicopter or balloon.(blimp) The brightness of this object was such that surly others must have experienced it as well. I hope this is helpful and hope to here other reports.<n>

Since my bed&#39;s headboard is against the wall with a window facing the backyard, and against the opposite wall is my dresser with a mirror on it, I can see out the window by looking into the mirror across from my bed. As I was reading in bed I saw a speck of white light going across the sky through the mirror, so I put my book down and looked out the window to watch it, and sure enough, it wasn&#39;t an airplane like I originally thought it was. As I watched, it flew west at about the speed of an airplane and then it started going in the opposite direction. It didn&#39;t stop or turn, it just all of a sudden started going east instead of west. Then, after it was behind the tree in my neighbor&#39;s backyard it stopped. I was still able to see it through the branches and after it hovered there for a couple minutes I ran and woke my parents up so they could see it, too. The three of us watched it for about twenty minutes, and it was moving very slowly east. Its speed was almost unnoticeable, east. After about twenty minutes the clouds came and covered the UFO so we couldn&#39;t see it anymore. My parents went back to sleep but I stayed up watching to see if the clouds would thin out enough to see it again. After I&#39;d waited ten minutes the UFO turned red and continued on its eastward journey at its original speed. It seemed to have grown about twice its original size, but that might just be because it changed color and became brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.

At first sight the ball of light was traveling at a low speed, then suddenly picked up to an extremely high speed and then dimmed quickly out of sight. The ball appeared strangely low to the ground, approximately 300 - 500 yards high.

3/7/08 15:40|Destin/Madison (between)|FL|Unknown|short|Hello, I know this might be strange or just my imagination, but I think I have a weather radar image of a UFO. I race off road dirt bik|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67863.html|270|ndxe200803| Hello, I know this might be strange or just my imagination, but I think I have a weather radar image of a UFO. I race off road dirt bikes and was checking the weather report for the Madison, Florida area on March 7, 2008, at 4:40 pm ET. I was looking to see if the area was going to get some rain; since we as a whole hate it when a race is dusty. I found this radar image that one can find on www.weather .com.   I put the map &#34;in motion&#34; and there was a section of movement that had this “straight line”, in like two or three frames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It caught my eye and I was like what the heck was that, so I paused the motion and advanced it frame by frame till the image came up. I say a straight line cause it was &#34;more straight than a cloud clearing of sorts,&#34; and low and behold there is this line that looks as if something flew through the cloud and made a trail. The end of the trail is round and looks as if the clouds move away from the end in uniform distance.  I first thought that it must be a jet fighter or something coming out of the military base, that I think is up there, but then I start to think about the scale of which the radar image is covering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is this thought that makes me wonder to myself what I have I have a picture of, I mean the radar image is in the middle of the slider scale which scans in and out from I guess ; city view all the out to multiple counties.  I have the scale in the middle when I printed the image. I have shown it to friends and no one has a clue as to what it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know weather can take on any form and it can take shapes that make us as people go huh, but this image is, in my opinion not a clearing of natural origin, but more of a picture of a wake so to speak. I would be happy to email a picture of it if can get it to scan clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well in conclusion, it could be said that it is an airplane, but some one would have to prove to me the scale of the radar image is that small and show me other weather radar pictures of airplanes that have been imaged and recorded.  I feel for know that this is an unidentifiable flying object that has been picked up on a weather radar loop swing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other questions that cross my mind are 1) how fast does a radar loop move and how many frames does it take to make one loop swing. This entire image lasted for three frames at most, before it was not visible in the radar loop  &#34;in motion.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks and get back to me via my email if you would like to see the printed out color copy of the image<n>

I saw a sphere in the northeast sky hovering in one place.  It looked like a star in the bright blue sky.  I watched as this sphere changed shape and morphed into two spheres.  One moved to the right and then rejoined the original one.  My friend was with me and witnessed this event also.  I grabbed my camera and shot these photos – if you zoom in you can see the sphere (definitely not a star or any other type of aircraft that I know of) and in the last photo you can see the faint outline of the second sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this sighting, I was again in my backyard (in May) with a friend and we saw the same sphere, but, this time it moved at a very rapid speed from south to north and, as it moved, a small strobe-like light shot out from the side and moved away to the east.  As the sphere approached the same location as the last time I had seen it, it stopped abruptly, another sphere appeared and flew off very fast to the north.  The original one hovered there for some minutes and then just faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The feeling I get after having witnessed is frustration at not knowing what the hell I’m looking at.  I hope we all find out something soon.<n>

I was sitting in the backyard of my mothers house, when I looked up, and saw, above the house behind her back fence, what appeared at first to me to be either a plastic shopping bag floating to the south.  As I watched it I began to think realize that it was unlikely something like that could be that high and still in the air.  Then I thought maybe it was a white balloon, but it was glowing white.  I followed it with my eyes as it ascended, still bearing south, up into the clouds, but it never dimmed and maintained the bright glow. Then seemed to change it&#39;s shape as it turned to go west.  It was completely silent.  Once the turn was complete, it regained it&#39;s original, round/oval shape. I ran into the house as it passed my view and told my brother to hurry and come into the front yard with me.  We both ran out into the front yard, and both witnessed it acsend higher and higher into the sky, appearing more like a bright star in midday.  As we continued to watch it, it dissapeared into the atmosphere...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never really believed in UFO&#39;s, although open minded to it.  I have been looking at UFO videos, and many of the UFO&#39;s caught on video are exactly like the one I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They streamed across the sky from the southwest to the northeast, at a very high rate of speed. I thought that they might have been meteors or space junk, but they were so hard to see. If I wasn’t watching an airplane fly over I would have never noticed them. I only saw them for about 5 to 8 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At moments it seemed to move a little but for the most part it stayed in pretty much the same place and was only visible when the spot light passed over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the light moved, you couldn’t see it.  We stood watching for about 10 minutes.  At one point there appeared to be two objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The theater shut the lights off at 10:00 pm.  Show over.<n>

The evening of the 6th, as a promotion the theater had numerous search lights (I would say five to seven) scanning the skies to attract attention of the event.  The weather that evening was probably 1000 foot layer of broken to overcast clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier that evening my girlfriend and I were watching the searchlights scan the clouds and watched the lights dance through the clouds for several minutes, as they lit the undercast.  Later that evening, about 9:45pm we once again went outside before going to bed.  I looked up at the searchlights still scanning the skies, when I noticed as the lights crossed a certain point in the clouds, there was a bright reflection coming from within the clouds.  The reflection was not like anything I had seen before, a very distinct long narrow reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained in the same place, not moving with the clouds, changing shape or intensity as the lights randomly past the same place.  I have been a commercial airline pilot for over 20 years and know the effects lights or lighting can have on the clouds.  This was NOT light reflecting of different layers or shear lines of the overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object for about 15 minutes, until the searchlights were extinguished for the night.  The object appeared to be in the cloud deck itself, and we were only able to see the light refracting off the object.  It would not have been balloons or other promotional material such as a banner, sign, etc for the theater as it would have been tethered almost on the centerline of the Tacoma Industrial Airport (TIW) and in the decent path, less than 1 mile for the runway.  That would have caused serious FAA fines to pull such a stunt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At several times, as the lights passed the object there appeared to be two reflections. I would be hard to estimate the size, due to it being in the clouds, but I would guestimate due to the height of the cloud deck I would say 30 to 40 feet in length, and 10 feet in width. There was no lights on the object.<n>

What is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then asked my husband where he was and he stated, &#34;right down the road from our house.&#34;  I looked out our family room window which faces south and saw 3 bright red lights in a lined formation and some individual red lights. The 3 lights would turn and quickly disappear and reappear in a different location. These lights looked to be lower in the horizon and to the north of the reddish scattered lights, I saw a bunch of twinkling small white lights dancing around the sky almost in sequence. I can’t tell if the white lights were individual or were of a extremely large object, but the white lights consumed a huge part of the northwestern sky and lasted only about 30 seconds then disappeared. The red lights however, would reappear and disappear over the coarse of 30 minutes. We did call the law authorities and they stated that they were jets making maneuvers and dropping flares. I could understand that to some extent with the reddish lights being flares but these lights would come and go as if moving in the horizon and the lights would turn. The white sequenced twinkling lights, would be more difficult to explain.<n>

A few minutes later the light appeared again and split horizontal in two, then faded away. The light appered a third and four time split horizontally into three lights all fading away. Twenty minutes later we arrived very excited at our desination only to see this happen two more times with my boyfriends dad!  We Also saw a jet head toward the objects before they went away.

We were laughing and singing along with the radio. I looked up into the sky and I saw a strange orange light. I felt almost hypnotized by it, then it disappeared. Immediately I told myself that it was only a glare from a passing vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was turning to ask my girlfriend if she saw anything. She was actually turning to ask me the same thing. so was a loud, simultaneous, &#34;Did you see that!!?&#34;  Now skeptical, but still thinking logical, I assumed it was a cloud passing over a bright star. Or even a planet. That&#39;s when I looked and about 3/4 mile northwest of the initial observation. I saw another one and then another right next to it. Each time one appeared... one disappeared in a timed sequence, and in a perfect, counter clockwise circular motion. Like a domino effect. Now intrigued, I frantically rolled down my window despite the cold winter air. Just when I thought it was gone another sequence would appear. Each time it appeared to multiply or pulsate, and always in a perfect sequence. There were never more than three lights in each one. I saw a total of three individual sequences on the way home, (like a 5 minute time period).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back to the house my girlfriend was trying to convince me that it was probably a helicopter or something. It wasn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So now we&#39;re standing in the driveway waiting on these things to show up again. It didn’t take long for them to appear. This time there are 2 sequences in the sky at once about a mile apart from each other, (she no longer thinks its a helicopter), and we can barely see super small twinkling lights in between each pulse. I also noticed that there were suddenly several of the small twinkling lights all over the western sky, moving in random directions. some fast some slow. some times disappearing/appearing. I noticed a low distant rumbling during the sequences. Like an engine, or explosion, or breaking barrier. Every dog in the neighborhood was barking. Just as fast as the show started, it ended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally cant think of a logical explanation. Fireworks? In the winter, with no sound, and in 2 different parts of the western sky... doubt it. Maybe a flare? Why? and how so timed in 2 different areas? Could be a hoax... but someone would have to have a lot of time on there hands because I did some research on this today. I discovered several, damn near, to the &#34;T&#34;, same observation as me. not only that, they were in different years and in different locations. Something else I noticed in my findings is these sightings almost always occur in the western sky.<n>

(All three homes occupy the same land and are only a few hundred yards apart.)  According to their first hand reports, my mother called and told me that she could see a white strobing light in the woods just above and behind their home.  As she was speaking, she told me that the light was changing colors from white to red.  She was actually quite frightened over the situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I next spoke with my brother who is a former deputy sheriff, EMT, and firefighter / rescue squad member.  He thought that it might possibly be the light from an aircraft that had went down in the woods, so he along with their neighbor (the chief of the area fire department) went to see what the situation was.  They could not tell exactly how far the light could actually be into the woods.  Some thought that it was close, while others thought the light might be larger, and farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they went to examine the situation, the light (after changing colors, multiplying, and performing unusual movements) disappeared.  They eventually found an area that they all thought was the location of the lights.  There was an area of approximately four feet around that included broken limbs on trees, and the leaves and ground clutter was cleared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He got pictures of the light anomaly, but not of the possible landing sight.  I asked him to get photos of the possible landing sight for me, but there was a snow storm coming, which has now arrived.  I asked him to still get photos if he possibly could, to see if there was any reaction to the snow from the sight.  Either way, I told him to get photos of the area as quickly as possible.  I also told him to retrieve ground samples and samples from the bark of the affected trees in the area, and any other possible samples for future testing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

That night it was clear and dark. as goofy as it sounds it reminded me of a craft going into warp drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights made a circular shape. So intrigued we turned around and stopped on the road. We pulled out the binoculars that we use for bird watching from our car. Upon closer inspect it had no visable wings but it also made no sound. So we decide to try and go under as we came closer it started to leave. Thats what else made it interesting because it speed away and disapeared in less than 10 seconds. We know that no aircraft can do that or it would have made a sound. I will also mention there we no clouds in the sky,it was a clear night. So it didnt go behind a cloud and it fly off so fast. The other thing though there was a plane near by that was flying to groton. So it defentally was flying faster than the plane. It was something that none of us could explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  Possible hoax??  PD))<n>
3/6/08 18:00|Altoona|IA|Light|hour|Blood-red orb being chased by multiple jets.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62089.html|285|ndxe200803| Blood-red orb being chased by multiple jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thursday, March 6th 2008,  I was sitting on my computer and I kept hearing continuous jet aircrafts flying over my small town of Altoona, Iowa, enough to make my house shake. At first i didn&#39;t take to much care into it but, it was happening about every couple minutes another jet or some kind of fighter aircraft that was very loud would fly over. This lasted for about an hour or so. Finally i got up to let my cat out on my back porch &amp; I saw a blood-red object that was very high in the air and was not pulsating this was around 9pm. It was very bright blood red and moving in 90- degree angels very quickly much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.  Two jets were chasing it, well were trying to keep up with it anyways. I was in awe standing on my deck with my cat. I ran inside and called a close friend who was about 5-10 miles away in a town called Pleasant hill. I explained to him what i was seeing and he didn’t really believe me. I stood on my back porch and there were about 20 to 30 different aircrafts spread out every flashing in the night sky. I thought it was very unusual for that many aircrafts to be flying around our small town because were no where near the Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided to go grab something to eat down the street &amp; drive around and investigate shortly after, there were more and more aircrafts flying around our town and i lost sight of the red orb like object. Shortly after I came inside i got a call from my friend that i called previously. He said that he was outside with two of our friends getting ready to get in there car in Pleasant hill and saw the same blood red object and there were the same jet aircrafts chasing it. But they heard a very silent hovering sound from the red object. They got in there car and turned on the radio but none of the stations would come in on FM they were all static same with the AM, Making odd fuzzy sounds throughout the car ride to my house. They arrived at my house and we all discussed and went over what we all saw.  We all had seen the same object; we concluded that the object was chased by the jet aircrafts from Altoona in the direction of Pleasant hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all were standing on my back porch discussing what happened while Aircrafts were still lingering all over our skies. As we were talking i realized about a month pervious on the night of February 16th i saw a similar blood-red object over Pleasant hill on my way home to Altoona coming home from a friends house. I didn’t think much of it at the time but it was the same solid-color blood red orb like object. I looked around the internet for sightings of UfOs in Altoona Iowa and found an abundance of similar UFO sightings throughout the months of February and January and march.  I was positive that the object I saw racing through the sky was not any sort of friendly air craft, seeing how it was a bright red orb of no familiarity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The jets that were chasing it were pulsating a very very bright white light in some kind of pattern so I’m not exactly sure if they were also ufo&#39;s or jets. They kept flying around in a pattern with the Red orb like object all over my town.  So it is very possible that the white strobe like lights that were following it a bit slower could have been UFO&#39;s as well or some type of military aircrafts. But there were 20-30 aircrafts circling Altoona for about 2 hours after the incident. There was also a very low altitude stealth looking silent aircraft flew over my neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure the exact type of stealth aircraft it was but im positive it was a stealth aircraft by the triangular lights on the bottom of the craft and it was also V-shaped. Im positive what we all saw was a ufo on account of military crafts chasing it and military crafts lingering around for two hours in the area My backyard is also a casino resort called prairie meadows which the Red object was hovering over to begin with. I hope to find as many others who have witnessed this encounter this is no joke or hoax.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are some very similar reports in Altoona Iowa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://unitedstatesufo.blogspot.com/2008/03/altoona-iowa-bright-star-like-object.html 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.ufoinfo.com/sightings/usa/080212.shtml 3.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.ufoinfo.com/sightings/usa/080131.shtml 4.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.myufo.com/2008/02/ufo_sighting_altoona_iowa_febr_1.html 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.hbccufo.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3779&amp; mode=threa d&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0   Daniel J, Wilson.<n>

3/6/08 07:28|Eugene|OR|Disk|2 minutes|Black, round, flat, disc flying twisting spiral pattern over the Eugene, Oregon morning sky.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62075.html|288|ndxe200803| Black, round, flat, disc flying twisting spiral pattern over the Eugene, Oregon morning sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to smoke my morning cigarette this morning (Thursday 3/6/2008, @ 7:28 AM exactly) when I noticed something out-of-the-ordinary flying in the sky to the east of me.  At first I thought it was a bird, but when no wings were moving I focused in on it with my eyes and figured that it had to be a loose &#39;weather&#39; balloon, or any type of balloon for that matter, ascending into the sky with the help of the wind.  Then I realized that there was no way it could be a balloon either.  As it continued to travel toward me (to the west) and further North, I was staring at it as its path advanced very quickly throughout the sky.  I could see it moving like no other &#39;balloon in the wind&#39; would ever move.  It was completely black and its shape was changing as it traveled through the air to the north before disappearing in the light layer of clouds that was layering the sky over the valley this morning.  It was clearly a thin (relative to my perspective), perfectly round disk of some sort, and while it flew, it spiraled and twisted like a flat Frisbee, a CD, or a flat rock would spiral if you were to throw one into the air.  It was twisting on it&#39;s axis while flying through the air (could not tell if it was spinning or not) very gently and softly but moving very fast though the sky.  The sighting lasted for about 2 minutes...from the moment I spotted it directly East of where I was standing, until the time it disappeared due North from my position.  I could see that it had a perfectly round shape when the angle was right, and I could also see its flatness when it shifted just enough on its side in the middle of its flight.  Its flight pattern was just like that of a bent Frisbee when thrown upside down...you know, it spiraled, sort of rotating on its lengthwise axis, as it flew, kind of twisting as its path advanced.  If you&#39;ve ever thrown a CD into the air, it was flying almost exactly like that, but proportionately, probably not as fast as a CD flung in the air.  It had very slow, smooth, ! almost f loating dynamics that made it seems like it was hovering almost...but it seemed like it was moving at a constant rate throughout the sky.  I could see its round profile and its flat profile as it spun/spiraled, depending on its position in flight relative to my point-of-view.  Its color was black, but it may have been that it was being silhouetted or shadowed or the like.  It was a flat, round disk, twisting and spiraling through the sky about as fast as it would take a small airplane to fly across that much airspace.  If one side was the &#34;top&#34; of the disk, and one side &#34;the bottom,” I must have seen the top and the bottom about 6 to 8 times each.  That is about how many rotations it made on its axis.  Its size was not determinable, and the altitude at which it was flying was also not determinable, so I cannot make any postulation as to any of those details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never in my life believed in any sort of inexplicable flying objects of any sort.  I always thought that people that believed they saw UFO either had overactive imaginations or were just ignorant in terms of existing aircraft, or a combination of many other factors.  I do not wear glasses and I have perfect 20/20 eyesight in each eye. This was my first time ever seeing what in my mind, I guess, HAS to be a &#39;UFO&#39;, meaning there is no way I can explain what I saw based on my own first-hand experiences.  I have never believed in &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; simply because I have never witnessed, first-hand, anything that I would qualify as such...there always seems to be an explanation (and there probably is one in my case, with my sighting this morning too!...I just don&#39;t have one right now!).  I always said that unless I see one myself (or a Sasquatch for that matter) I can&#39;t logically claim to believe in them.  This is my first ever &#39;UFO&#39; sighting.  I even caught about 30 seconds of what I thought would be good footage using my cellular phone&#39;s video application...to no avail.  Immediately upon recording the sky, I could tell that there was nothing visible showing up on my phone&#39;s screen.  Nothing showed up during the recording process and there is nothing at all on the footage I have saved on my phone...just the hazy morning sky...no black spot, no nothing!....the object must have been too far away to register on my phone (a 2 Mega-pixel camera-phone).  That is all I have to report.  Conveniently, I am making this report here because I happened to see your website on TV; a History channel special on &#34;the grays&#34; which ran last night, and that is how I knew that this is the place to come if I ever needed to make a report.  Well, wouldn&#39;t you know it...the day after that is the day I have my first UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At this point, I was awake laying in bed hoping to get back to sleep, clock now reading 5:17 am, as I rolled over and stared out the window at two dim white stars in the sky to the left of the Grants Pass Peak, I then noticed that the star to the right of the other one was moving very slowly eastward.  As it moved slowly through the easterly sky the dim light got brighter and it appeared to get larger in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped out of bed to watch it out my window as it continued to move to the east and to my surprise it started zig zagging upward and downward in the sky for a few seconds.   At this point I knew for sure it wasn’t any airplane or helicopter.  It went back to its previous position in the sky and headed east once again.  Still in my view, I continued watching it and then it did something I didn’t expect it to do and that is drop downward in the sky and circle around heading westward back in the direction it came.  The bright light and large size appeared to be getting smaller as it started dimming as it continuing moving westerly and then it disappeared.  I was thinking I had seen the last of it when it appeared further to the west and after a few seconds of watching it once more, it disappeared for the last time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: Our house guest was using our spa roughly nine hours previous to my sighting and seen a strange white light moving around in the sky above the same peak.<n>

3/6/08 00:00|Springfield|VA|Diamond|15 min|I drove right underneath the craft as it crossed over the road right by the Sunoco gas station located on the Gambrill road exit ramp.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62074.html|292|ndxe200803| 12:15 AM March 6, 2008  I was driving back home from my brother’s apartment in Alexandria, VA right around midnight when I saw this object. I was driving west on the Fairfax County Parkway into Springfield where my parents live when I noticed an unusually bright air plane about 35 degrees from the horizon in the west/north-west region of the sky. Living in Springfield I am located between two major airports; Washington International, and Dulles.  Seeing many air planes in the Northern Virginia sky is extremely common, air traffic is quite busy in this area. However, at night air planes have a distinct brightness and have flashing lights on the wings to identify commercial air craft, and are not hard to determine. The craft I saw was about four to five times brighter than the other air planes in the sky and had a golden white light emitting from all sides. I did not see any blinking lights that resembled the lights on regular air planes. There were commercial airplanes flying in other parts of the sky during the sighting so I could tell that this craft appeared quite different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continuing my route home, I noticed that I was getting much closer to the object. It appeared to have been flying close to the Fairfax County Parkway. I also remember that I couldn’t take my eyes off it, it seemed too bright and was moving way to slow and just seemed out of place. It was approximately 5 minutes after initially spotting it that I got close enough to it that I could see that it was not a helicopter. It was also silent; I couldn’t hear any engine sounds of any kind. It seemed to have been flying over the neighborhood near Hunt Valley elementary school before I saw it slowly cross over the Fairfax County Parkway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove right underneath the craft as it crossed over the road right by the Sunoco gas station located on the Gambrill road exit ramp. When I was approaching the craft just before driving directly underneath it I could tell that this object was about 250-300 feet off the ground and was moving at maybe 50-100 mph. I remember stretching my neck out of my window to get a closer look at it when it silently floated across the parkway, and over the neighborhood on the other side. While looking at the craft from underneath, it looked like a diamond shape but with an elongated front point. I could not see any wings, granted it was dark out, but I was able to see that the whole craft had a white-ish yellow glow with two yellow point lights close together that did not blink on the underside. I would estimate from the distance it looked in the air, that the size of this object was anywhere between 70 to 90 feet long and about 20 feet wide. After it crossed over the parkway, I kept turning my head back and saw it fly barely over the tree line bordering that neighborhood. I tried to keep my eye on it as I was just about home. When I turned off the parkway onto the Hooes road exit I could still see it barely above the trees, and still so bright. I lost sight of it as I turned into my neighborhood across the bridge from the fire station. I would say that I lost sight of it as it was somewhere above the Newington Forest area. This object seemed to be flying too low and too slow to be passenger airliner or single passenger plane.<n>

3/5/08 20:00|Woodbridge|VA|Light|45 minutes|Many odd behaving lights hover above trees, then rise in the sky, moving strangly and not making noises.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62080.html|299|ndxe200803| Many odd behaving lights hover above trees, then rise in the sky, moving strangly and not making noises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 5th I was driving with my dad, when I look to the west and there are four or five yellowish white lights hovering low in the skyline, clustered together. They didn&#39;t appear to be moving but then one at a time about 30 seconds after each other, they would move, usually vertically into the sky and start to blink strangely, very unlike the behavior of an airplane or helicopter. We could not hear them at all, they did not go in one straight path like an airplane but moved sporadically. We drove into a parking lot and saw more of the same kind of behavior for about thirty minutes. We would see a few a yellowish lights just above the trees, stagnant and then it would start moving up ward, and then proceed to move about the western part of the sky oddly. At one point there was eight or ten in the sky at once, all in the western part of the sky. None of them crossed the sky like a plane does. I saw one fall straight down extremely fast, appearing almost like a meteor. My dad thinks they must have been near Dulles airport, but we are both absolutely certain these could not have been airplanes, or even helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 6th, after explaining to my friend earlier in the day about my experiences, i continued to see suspicious blinking and hovering lights throughout the night. But around 10:15 we went out on his driveway to smoke a cigarette. And immediately upon looking at the sky we could already see strange blinking lights at different heights in the sky. This time it appeared they were directly above Woodbridge. A few seemed to cross directly above us. The yellow lights would again hover at a distance above the treetops, and then rise, start blinking white, red and blue lights and then move at a very fast speed, all without making any noise at all. One did cross above us particularly low in the sky. When it was above us it appeared to look like a triangle with a light in each corner, but we could not see the outline of the plane. Again, we felt odd that it didn&#39;t make any noise at all. We saw about ten of these, all throughout the sky, and on the drive home we saw one low in the sky, with many more lights then the others. It had white lights all lined up on it&#39;s side on one single craft. We took some pictures of several of these lights, I&#39;m not sure about the quality as I haven&#39;t seen them on a computer yet, but my friend can send then to me and if you want I can send these to you.<n>

However, I&#39;m certian it was on a day between Feb. 10 and Apr 5, 2008.  I will describe the best I can.... I was in Jacksonville, Fl on the campus of Jacsonville U.  I saw a silent, dark, triangular object cruising at an altitude of no more than 1,000 ft and the length of each side appeard to be approx. 160 feet, give or take 20 ft.  I clocked it at bout 75-100 mph and was standing almost directly underneath its flight path (it was about 120 ft off to my left side) and there was a circular white light near each corner of the triangle (8-15 in diameter?). It was also headed North.  I didn&#39;t make a big deal about it to my friends cause theres no point and it&#39;s honestly not that shocking to me.  But it was awesome b/c that technology seemed eithr a good many evolutions ahead of the current stuff on the mass market or it was alien.  Either way ! O SHITson!!  I promise this is the truth, this is the first and only time I&#39;ve seen anything like it 24 years and I was sober and on no meds, know what I mean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> sincerely,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I have been a clinical research professional for the past 14 years.  I manage clinical drug studies for pharmaceutical and biotech firms.  I have a degree in life sciences.  My career involves frequent air travel.  As a frequent flier for twelve years, I have never really seen any strange sights or possible UFOs until yesterday, March 5, 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on an American Airlines 4:50 PM flight from Tucson to Dallas.  The flight left Tucson at 5:00 PM (Mountain Time).  The flight flew approximately in a east-northeasterly route and the skies were generally cloudy and the ground below was not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About thirty minutes into the flight, the skies cleared and the ground became visible.  There was no haze or dust obscuring the view from my seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking out the plane’s window at the ground below, I spotted a (chrome) metallic, saucer-shaped disc hovering above the ground.   As we were flying about 30, 000 feet, the object was below and I got a good view of the top and sides of it.  It appeared to be metallic as I could see the setting sun reflected on it’s surface.  The surface was smooth as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that it was nearly stationary, hovering over the same spot.  It wobbled and pitched a little but remained stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ground below looked like typical desert and was devoid of any trees or grasses.  There was a dry creek bed to the left (east) of the object and the nearest indication of human activity in the area was a circular crop field about a mile or two east of the creek bed. I did not see any buildings or roads anywhere nearby to where the object was hovering.  I estimated that the object must have been about 1000-1500 feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I wondered if I was seeing a water tower but I did not see any type of supporting structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for as long as I could.  I estimate that I watched it for a good four to five minutes.  I looked at my watch after I could not see it any longer and noted the time at 5:35 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also estimated that this area was about 250 miles east-northeast of Tucson, AZ.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was expecting the object to fly off but it appeared not to notice my plane flying above it.  It stayed stationary the whole time I viewed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to view it on three sides- west facing  to top to east facing.  It was perfectly symmetric except the top did seem to have conical shape.  I am not sure of the diameter of the object but I would guess that it might have been around 40-60 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered if other passengers or anyone on the ground saw it?<n>

Above the horizon, I first noticed a small white light which looked like a star, but there were no other stars visible in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a moment I noticed an identical white light above and to the right.  It started to move and left a clear con-trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a half minute the first light also started to move upward with a contrail.  They both stopped and stayed.  A third light was then seen above and to the right of both.  It moved down with a contrail and stopped so all three lights were in a perfect row, diagonal.  They stayed for at least a minute perfectly still with no contrails visible anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time my bus came and I left, but as the bus circled around (about 3 minutes later) for one last view, I still saw two of the lights staying.  I took three pictures with a low res cell phone but I can&#39;t see anything on the images.<n>

She was sitting eating breakfast and happened to notice a strange light out the back window. She said she watched it, got her sister (15), and witnessed three distinct groups of lights hovering over the rooftops in the distance. They said they could see a dark object in the center of one, but two were just hovering as changing colored lights (at different heights),  That&#39;s when they woke me. I ran outside to see and confirmed two of these objects. At an arms length I&#39;d say they were about the size of an aspirin or peanut.  Fairly large and distinct with 4 or 5 lights making up a cross or diamond shape.  The lights were pulsating and changing colors: red, green, blue, white, turquoise.  They were hovering at different heights above the rooftops of the next neighborhood.  One was very low, just barely over the rooftops, the other about twice the height of the homes below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went in to get my astronomical telescope to see if I could zero in on it. While I was trying to sight it, the one I was watching reduced in size, turned orange and began to move to my right. I followed it around to the front of my house and watched it slowly move parallel to the ground just above the rooftops until it disappeared behind homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other light was gone when I looked back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter tried to film it, but could not get it focused due to palm fronds interfering with autofocus. However, you can see the two objects and the colors that they were cycling through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t know, of course, what it was, but the two objects I saw were silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About twenty minutes later I went back outside and saw an aircraft approaching from a different part of the horizon and could clearly hear that it was a helicopter.  So I use that in contrast to the silence of the first sighting. The night sky was clear, but moonless, so it was very dark.<n>

It was moving at a steady pace and it wasn&#39;t loud as if it were a plane or helicopter.  It was a lot smaller than either of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe I had seen a one of those blinking tower lights flashing, but once I focused on the red flashing object and realized it wasnt a blinking light from the electric poles, it vanished into thin air.<n>

When I tried to focus my binoculars on it, it retreated in reverse away from the earth into the cloud cover.  And it moved fast. This probably took about two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted our weather service and our local newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m waiting to hear if there were other sightings.<n>

As it traveled another small white object (sphere) came/fell down verticall down from an old spread out chemtrail overhead and briefly followed the first object.  It begain to do a cork screw maneuver behind the first object then turned back up vertically, keeping it&#39;s corkscrew trajectory back up into the cloud from which it orginally came from.  The first object continued on as nothing had happened.  I waited about 10 minutes to see if anything else might happen.  None did.<n>

I am a registered nurse holding a masters degree in health care administration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just gotten off work and was traveling East on Hwy 64 when I encountered a strange sighting. Around milepost 155 I passed numerous bill boards along both sides of the road, and then there were tall trees on both sides.  All of a sudden around milepost 144,  a single golf ball-sized bright light was centered on my rear view mirror.  It was so bright that it was blinding me, and  I had to put my hand up in front of the mirror.  At first I thought it had to have been a motorcycle, but it was way too close to my window.  Also, it just came out of nowhere very quickly;  one second it wasn’t there, and then the next second it was.  I turned off the radio and rolled down the electric window, but the only sounds were that of my 2001 Buick, and it was a quiet vehicle.  The object stayed right with me without moving for about four minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road was getting ready to turn to the left, and the area opened up on both sides.  An 18-wheeler was coming around the bend, and would be passing me in about 30 seconds.  Right before the truck reached me, the object jetted quickly to the left-hand side of my back window, just out of view of my side view mirror.  As soon as the truck passed me, the object swept toward the truck and then disappeared.  I kept looking back toward the truck, but I never saw the light or a single headlight following the truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then followed the road to the left in the turn, and lost sight of the 18-wheeler.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this happened, about three minutes down the road, East 64 slowed down in preparation of entering the town of Plymouth, North Carolina.<n>

I brought it to my husbands attention and we, along with a car behind us, pulled off the the side of the road. The 4-5 lights were VERY bright and stayed in one place. Then, a 6-7-8 light lit up and all 8 light lit up across a large area of the sky. The &#34;UFO&#34; stayed in the area and lit for about 4 minutes. Then, one by one the lights slowly went out. My husband called the local sheriff&#39;s office and they stated there had been several reports to them over the last 3-4 nights, but quit a bit tonight. I called the local airport (very small one) and was informed that there were no flights in the area. This happened North of Caney Kansas on highway 75 just south of Havana Lake.

My wife and I were laying on a beach just outside Barcelona on a perfectly clear day.  I first noticed (and then her as well) an orb which had a yellowish-red appearance high in the sky.  There was no contrail.  Its movements were erratic and appeared to follow and almost elliptical pattern.  It grew smaller (which I took to be movement away from the observer) and then disappeared.  Approx. 10 min. later, it returned to the same place of initial observation and followed the same pattern.  It again vanished within ten minutes.  Total time of observation approx. 30 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  I was alone and walking to work when I noticed the same object in the sky over the moountains directly west of Barcelona and above the Collserola Communications tower.  I was unable to observe for exceedingly long because it eventually drifted behind the buildings to my west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  Approx. two weeks after the sighting just described, I observed the same object, but this time I was able to follow it for almost 45 minutes.  It behaved in much the same pattern as previously.  Initially, it apeard to be roughly half-oragen and half-red.  It drifted back and forth in what appeared to be arranged patterns.  Eventually, its size changed.  It grew smaller and the color changed to golden, and then almost white with a metallig shine.  I again assumed this to be its rising higher from my observational position.  It eventually disappeared high above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  Approx 4 weeks after initial sighting on beach I was walking to the supermarket where I observed the object MUCH closer approximately 1/2 mile from my position.  It was a clear day in late March.  The object can only be described as a donut lying on its side, spinning much in the same way a coin would spin when rotating to rest flatly.  The center was lighter colored and the &#34;edges&#34; darker colored; almost brown.  Others around me observed this as well, though most eventually continued on with their business.  I followed the object visually for approx.  ten minutes.  It stayed perfectly still in the sky (save its own motion).  It appeared to hover for quite some time before beginning to move slowly northbound.  It speed progressively increased until it had risen higher in the sky, giving it the &#34;traditional&#34; reddish-orange appearance and then subsequently metallic white before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this reported time period, there were other reported sightings in Malaga (a suburb of Barcelona) as well as along a few major highways.  The objects did not exhibit any common aerodynamic characteristics, jut as they did not appear to be affected by air currents.  Their movement patterns ruled out any influences by upper air currents (returning to their initial positions).  These sightings have yet to be explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

3/2/08 23:30|Gretna|LA|Light|a few seconds|Orange/reddish light moving at an incredible speed through the night sky.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62103.html|319|ndxe200803| Orange/reddish light moving at an incredible speed through the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 11:30 pm on March 2, 2008, I observed a orange/reddish light moving in a northeasterly direction over the city of Gretna, Louisiana.  The time and date is memorable because it was my birthday and my wife and I were visiting New Orleans to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and my 65th birthday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light that I observed was unusual because it proceeded across the night sky at a remarkable speed…taking less than a few seconds to pass overhead and disappear in the night glare of downtown New Orleans.  By comparison, moments after the light disappeared, a commercial airliner moved across the sky at a snail’s pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the light was comparable to lights one might see on an airplane, not particularly bright but not flashing or changing in color.  If at the altitude of normal air traffic, the light would have been moving much faster than the speed of sound.  If at a lower altitude, one would have expected a horrendous noise (as from jet fighter plane) but no sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was definitely not a meteor or a satellite.  A meteor would not have moved that slowly and a satellite would not have moved that rapidly.  No sparks, contrail, or trailing illumination was observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have watched the night sky all my life and never witnessed anything similar to this rapidly moving light.<n>

The objects appeared distinct and moved relative to each other but maintained the general shape of the formation taking approximately 10 seonds to move across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was warmer than typical and sky clear;  the brightness of the individual objects equivalent or slightly fainter than average star that evening.<n>

It was odd... aircraft generally have one solid white light with a red and green on each side. There was no noise... just a white light that blinked steadily. It moved steadily across the sky, directly overhead, and moved behind some high, very thin clouds. At this point, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out into the front yard to scan the sky in the direction it was travelling.  It never reappeared! It travelled about the speed of a low-altitude plane, but was as high in the sky as a jetliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was brighter than a jet would be. Strange!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been a field investigator for 18 years. I&#39;ve spent much of this time investigating Bigfoot reports for Oregonbigfoot.com, of which I am the director.  However, I&#39;ve spent many years following up on UFO reports as well. I&#39;m very aware of the appearance of planes and jets at all altitudes.  This did NOT have the appearance of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would add that there have been two occasions in the last few months that my research partner and I have been up near Oakridge, Oregon and have seen steady, bright white, soundless craft moving across the sky.  I captured these on film on one occasion.<n>

I was finishing a smoke outside, looking at the Big Dipper, when I noticed a movement appear out of nowhere near the constellation.  I focussed on it and saw what looked like lights in the form of a triangle.  There were maybe 12-15 lights total.  They appeared to be a purer white color than the yellow hue of the stars.  They almost looked like a flock of birds flying in formation but steadily all together so I assumed that these lights came from one object.  If it were next to the full moon, it would be about 75% of its size.  The UFO flew for 30 seconds at about a 45-degree angle from my view before disappearing into the sky, traveling from South to North ascending at a very smooth and rapid speed without making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near the San Francisco International Airport and have seen numerous airplanes in various stages of flight and also during take-off and landing throughout the day and into the night.  Airplanes are loud, and have different colored lights.  What I saw tonight was nothing like the planes I’ve seen departing or arriving from SFO Airport.  It was faster and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual, and we found him to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD))<n>

My 8-year-old son and I walked my niece back to their house. We were walking back home and talking about going to the back yard to lay down on the trampoline to watch the stars since it was over 61 degrees F...and the sky was clear. As we were walking, I looked towards my house, which is south of my parents house...and I pointed at a bright orange light and said, &#34;what is that?&#34;. I thought it was a really bright planet or something, but I didn&#39;t remember hearing anything about  that...as soon as I had thought that, it disappeared. My son witnessed that as well. As soon as that one had disappeared, another one appeared in the east. Very bright orange-white light. I turned around and told my other niece to run in and tell my parents to come outside and look. I saw it happen in 3 different places about 5 times before I ran inside to grab my camera and drive my car to my parents house. As I got onto their front deck, I saw another one...an! d my brother, Luke, was able to see it just before it faded. He saw another one with me that was a lot dimmer and moved up. My dad, James, came outside and together we saw over 8 occurances in different locations. There were 3-4 times that we saw two lights grouped together. I tried to get a video of the lights, but all it captured was our voices...I will try to find a video editor and see if I can brighten the video. It was very interesting. I&#39;d like to know if there are any other reports of this please. Thank you!

3/2/08 19:30|Portland|OR|Formation|5+ minutes|Dual Clusters of unknown objects in the skies of Portland, Oregon.|3/4/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62039.html|328|ndxe200803| Dual Clusters of unknown objects in the skies of Portland, Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While travelling home from grocery shopping with my girlfriend, I happened to look up into the partly-cloudy sky as something caught my eye.  At first, I thought it was the moon, showing through the clouds, but as you know, when driving, the moon doesn&#39;t appear to &#39;move&#39; noticeably unless you turn your car or the like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then that I looked more closely and saw what appeared to be a tight cluster of objects.  It was dark and while they did not appear to be glowing, they were ever so much lighter than the sky or clouds behind them.  My girlfriend was driving so I asked her to stop the car.  We pulled over and got out of the vehicle. She was the first one to see the second cluster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This second grouping was not so &#39;tight-knit&#39; as the first. I was easy to dismiss the whole event as escaped balloons at first....especially with the first group being so close together. But, with their altitude, it was plain to see these two clusters were much too far apart to be simultaneous balloon releases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed that we could make out individual &#39;units&#39; in the second cluster which moved almost like fish in the water. There appeared to be 30 or more in this cluster alone. Not pushed about on the wind like floating balloons, and certainly not with the flapping motion of a bird, the movement of each unit was fluid with definite acceleration by some to keep the group together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Birds such as geese, flying in a V formation, do not circle for a better position within their group, as we witnessed that night. I&#39;ve never believed in aliens, flying saucers or the like, but I was hoping someone has more information on what these objects could more logically be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think I&#39;d rather live with good confirmation that we are alone in the universe.<n>

My impression was that it was three to 10 feet from tip to tip, 20-50 feet above the ground, moving silently at a steady speed of about 10 mph in a straight line. It was very faint, barely visible, perhaps even transparent. There were no details I could make out. I saw it for about three to five seconds, until I lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not at all certain that this was not an owl or other nocturnal bird, or even a trick of the eyes. I will admit that a few months or so later I saw what I am sure was an owl, and noticing the resemblence concluded that that must have been what I witnessed previously. Upon seeing a very similar phenomena on 09-13-2009 however, I rethought the experience and decided I could not be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

DIMMED OF COURSE, THE COLORS LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE PINK, BLUE, GREEN, WHITE OR CLEAR.  THEY DID BLINK IN A PATTERN. THERE WAS NO SOUND AS IT HOVERED WITH NO MOVEMENT.  I SUDDENLY HAD A FEELING OF FEAR BECAUSE MY SON WAS STILL OUTSIDE WITH ME.  I GRABBED HIS ARM AND WENT INSIDE. AT THIS POINT I WAS PRETTY SHOOK UP AND TOLD MY BOYFRIEND TO LOOK OUTSIDE.

TO THIS DAY HE DENIES SEEING ANYTHING (POTENTIAL WITNESS).<n> <n><n> <n><n> AT THIS POINT I WAS STILL PRETTY SCARED, SO I KEPT LOOKING OUT MY SIDE DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL THERE.  MY GUESS IS IT STAYED FOR PROBABLY ANOTHER 10 MINUTES.  THE STRANGEST PART TO ME IS I DIDNT REACT THE WAY I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE.  THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE SEEMS EERIE.  I WOULD HAVE TAKEN A PICTURE, CALLED SOMEONE, OR STAYED OUTSIDE BY MYSELF TILL IT HAD LEFT BUT, I DIDNT.  I DONT REMEMBER MUCH ELSE FROM THAT NIGHT.  THE NEIGHBORS WERE RETIRED NUNS.  I DIDNT ASK THEM ABOUT ANYTHING OUT OF EMBARRASMENT AND OBVIOUSLY THEIR STRONG RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND.  I DID NOTICE SOME INJURIES RIGHT AFTER.  THAT THEY SAID WAS DUE TO SURGERY ON BOTH (AT THE SAME TIME?).   THEN AFTER LIVING THERE FOR MANY YEARS THEY UPPED AND MOVED TO THEIR OLD PARISH.  I NOW KICK MYSELF FOR NOT ASKING ANYTHING ABOUT THAT NIGHT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> EVEN STRANGER FOR ME, I DIDNT SAY ANYTHING FOR ABOUT 2 DAYS ABOUT WHAT I HAD SEEN.  I HAD COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN OR BLOCKED OUT, I DONT KNOW,  THE WHOLE THING UNTIL MY BOYFRIEND STARTED TO MAKE FUN OF ME ABOUT WHAT I HAD SAW.  I WOULD HAVE AT LEAST CALLED MY DAD AS WE HAVE A MUTUAL INTEREST IN THE MATTER.  I CANT STOP THINKING ABOUT ALL THAT HAPPENED?  HAS ANYONE HAD A SIMILAR SIGHTING OR EXPERIENCE (WEIRD FEELING, CANT EXPLAIN)?  I WAS COMPLETELY FLOORED!  HOW COULD I FORGET ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN SO IMPORTANT TO ME IN MY PAST, AS WELL AS, NOW IN MY PRESENT?  I AM REALLY BOTHERED BY THIS WITH NO ONE TO TALK TO ABOUT IT.

I could not come to a definitive conclusion, fore I have often in my 50 plus years observed birds in flight and never did they appear like this.  I only know that I witnessed glowing lights or orbs in an asymmetrical formation.  To me, they are unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
3/1/08 14:00|Phoenix|AZ|Other|2 weeks|Star-like craft over Phoenix Arizona inthe daytime.|8/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/064/S64840.html|339|ndxe200803| Star-like craft over Phoenix Arizona inthe daytime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date I have provided is approximate only because I witnessed these craft on a daily basis for over two weeks. I already have numerous sighting statements on record at MUFON that I made daily during the sighting period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first sighting of the star-like craft was made in the afternoon here in Phoenix while I was outside on a break. I was looking up at a jetliner that was cruising overhead out of Sky Harbor International airport and I noticed what appeared to be a star shining directly over my head at about 2PM in the afternoon. I was perplexed as to why I would be able to see a star in the middle of the day when suddenly the &#39;star&#39; started to move very slowly and then stop. I watched it make these manuevers for about 6 minutes but my break was almost over and I had to go back inside to work - however, I thought that I just had to figure out what it was I was looking at. It was so far up that I figured it must be at about a 60 thousand foot level or so. It started moving again and then it just &#39;popped&#39; out of existence altogether ! I was freaking out at that point. I began to deliberately look up at the sky for the duration of my breaks and lunches and sure enough, every single day I saw these star-like craft just appear out of nowhere and for the most part they would just move across the sky until they were no longer in my range of sight, but the thing that really got to me was the FACT that they would just suddenly appear out of nowhere. About the 3rd day of my seeing these things, I watched a total of 5 of these things appear from the same part of the sky and then move off into different directions until I could no longer see them. On one occasion I watched two disc shaped craft fly over our building at about a 20 thousand foot level and fly side-by-side from west to east at a very fast rate of speed and disappear off in the horizon over Scottsdale Arizona. I would have to estimate that they were flying at around 2000+ miles per hour because of how quickly they traversed the sky. No sound at all came from any of these craft at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did on 2 different occasions have other employees outside with me that watched the UFO&#39;s with me so I at least had witnesses to verify what I was seeing. I don&#39;t know what I saw other than the fact that these craft made moves and achieved flight speeds that exceed any known aircraft that I have ever witnessed in my lifetime. Phoenix is has a major air force base to the west called LUKE AFB and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me to find out that they have been tracking these craft yet they will never admit it. I have a feeling that the lid is going to be blown off the ET visitors being hee on earth very soon but I for one am anxious to have it happen as soon as possible!<n>
