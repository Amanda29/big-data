In background were one small dot to right side in all pictures.  DID not seem to be due to camera or dust on negative.  My AUNT MOVED IN 1979 AND THRU THE WOODEN SUITCASE AWAY.  I wanted to look at pictures in the 80s again and compare the dots and see if same position on all prints. THIS TOOK PLACE IN VANCOUVER BC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The photos were disposed of, apparently.  The Crater Lake we are familiar with is in Oregon.  Perhaps there is one in California, as well.  PD))<n>
