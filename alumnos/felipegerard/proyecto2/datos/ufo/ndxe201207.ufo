Each had a single bright white pulsing light with what appeared to be red and green smaller strobes circling the brighter white light.  We initially thought the object were planes but then observed erratic zig-zag movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have high powered 1watt blue laser pointer which I aimed at the closest object.  When u did this the object would instantly jump away from the beam in a manor of I have never observed any aircraft move.  We continued to watch the object for nearly 30 minutes until 2 of them disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3rd continued to maintain its general location moving effortlessly in a zig - zag motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us ever heard any sounds from the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2345 hours we stopped watching the object and went in the house.<n>

I attached my camera to the telescope and took several pictures. The object/craft appears as a disc./dome shape white in color with what appears to be a window or possibly an open ramp on one side casting a shadow.  It was 11:30pm July 30 2012.  This object/craft was there until I stopped watching at 1:00am July 31 2012.I came back out the following evening August 1 2012 and set up the scope and camera,took several pictures of the same location and the object craft is not there anylonger.<n>

Appeared to be following each other or had a flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 11 pm my friends and I witnessed what appeared to be orange orbs in the night sky.  We got out of the car an observed more closely.  They were ascending from the ground in the distance and slowly moving upward toward the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about 7-9 at a time.  They would reach a certain point in the sky and slowly vanish away into the darkness.  As some disappeared more followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These waves lasted about 1 minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total number of orbs seen were about 20.<n>

I could not see the shape of what the lights were on, but the tail end red light seemed to change distance from the other two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All were very close together and did not seem to move quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot tell the distance because of the darkness and not being able to see the actual craft shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in my sight on and off for 30 minutes, disappearing out of sight right outside of Burbank off to my right.<n>
7/31/12 22:30|Finley|WA|Unknown|15 minutes|3 lights spaced wide moving slowly east to west then turning north|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91381.html|8|ndxe201207| 3 lights spaced wide moving slowly east to west then turning north<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and myself watched as 3 lights, 2 red, first and middle, and a cluster of white, trailing, lights moved across the sky from east to west then turning north until it was out of view because of the tree line, at the speed of what I would say, blimp speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were spaced widely apart, and holding my arms straight out and pointing at the first and last light, the distance between my fingers was approx. 10 inches. It made no noise and the lights moved together as if they were on one object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was dark it was difficult to judge the distance of how far away it was, but  our sight was at about a 45 degree angle from looking straight out, and straight up.<n>
7/31/12 22:15|Wallula|OR||1 minute|Three lights -- red/red/white -- easily identified as three separate aircraft, as one had flashing navigation strobe lights.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91414.html|9|ndxe201207| Three lights -- red/red/white -- easily identified as three separate aircraft, as one had flashing navigation strobe lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observed three lights in formation -- red/red/white -- while at a new observatory site in Washington.  The site is located at about 1600 feet in elevation in the Wallula Gap hills south of the Columbia River, just north of the Oregon border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were setting a North-South line in the now empty observatory in preparation of setting the large telescope mounting into the observatory.  We were done with our work at about 10:15 PM and came out of the observatory building to notice the ‘lights’ floating along to the north of us:  two bright red lights and one while light with flashing running lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were equally spaced and moving slowly.  I laughed and noted to my friends “look a UFO”.  I commented that any non-astronomer would likely comment that the object(s) were a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for about a minute as the object moved to the west.  They did not keep perfect spacing, so the object was not something solid and made us think they were three separate aircra! ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the lights turned and headed north, and it was easy to see they were likely three aircraft moving in formation, one after the other, as you could see them form a nice ‘arc’ of lights as they moved in their turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The interesting aspect was the front two craft had steady red lights, while the trailing craft had a white light and running strobe lights as normal aircraft do.  So, whatever craft the red lights were, they did not have normal strobe lights, which is maybe why they had a trailing craft to make sure they were not mis-identified by other aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft were at two-three miles away.  They were moving slowly, much like small fixed wing aircraft or helicopters.  Because we were on a hilltop they were at eye level elevation.  We were looking north and they were due north of us.  They were traveling west at first and we saw the port running light in the last aircraft blinking as well as the white light, and then as they turned north, we could see both the port and starboard running lights in the last aircraft.  Both of the advance aircraft just had red lights and no blinking running lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes, all three of us, all astronomers with extensive experience observing celestial objects thought they were aircraft and also mused how others without experience in observing moving objects in the sky could be convinced they were UFO&#39;s and or &#39;baffled&#39; by the formation.  I have seen much more startling formations of lights in the night sky in the form of aerial tankers refueling jet aircraft as well as formations of satellites in orbit around the earth.  I have seen much more &#39;baffling&#39; formations.  These were clearly aircraft moving in formation.  The thing we questioned was why the front two aircraft did not have normal running lights and only bright red lights.  Perhaps you could find that out and let me know.  I like to report these types of events to my students so they can be better observers of celestial objects, moving or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

7/31/12 21:30|Clio|MI|Fireball|1 minute|Phenomenal bright orange light disappears in clear night sky in Clio, MI on July 31, 2012|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91742.html|12|ndxe201207| Phenomenal bright orange light disappears in clear night sky in Clio, MI on July 31, 2012<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, July 31 2012 at approximately 9:30 p.m. a friend and I witnessed something that cannot be explained in a clear sky in Clio, Michigan. I live a short distance from the downtown Clio Amphitheater where there is a concert held every Tuesday, typically between 7-9 pm. We sat on my front porch and listened to the concert which ended at around 9 pm. We remained talking on the porch after it was over and I had just happened to glance up into southern horizon where I witnessed an extremely bright fire-orange light traveling on a 25-30 degree angle from NE to SW at a very low speed. I had never seen anything like this before, and briefly sat in astonishment before cutting off my friend in mid-conversation, stating “Dude… What is that!” He looked up as I pointed out the object, we were both speechless… I turned off the front porch light (without losing sight off the object) to get a better view. This bright orange light had no defined borders (but appeared! to be more sphere-shaped than anything else) continued to travel NE-SW very low to the horizon (25-30 degrees) at a very close distance; first appearing to be about the size of a quarter before suddenly shifting to 45 degrees and dimming slightly and becoming smaller in size (about the size of a dime). The object remained orange in color and continued to fade, brighten, and travel very slow. It completely disappeared for about 5 seconds, then faintly reappeared for about 5 seconds, then slowly vanished into the sky. The entire incident lasted about 1 minute. We remained on the porch until 11:30 pm hoping to see the object again but it never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have looked on the internet since then hoping that someone else had seen it and it turns out that there have been many similar sightings in July, but nobody has posted anything about this particular incident that occurred on 7/31/12 in Clio, MI at approximately 9:30 pm. This is surprising due to the incident occurring shortly after the concert ended downtown; typically at this time locals walk home from the concert or hang out in the park for a while. Surely, somebody else had to of seen this bright orange UFO in the sky other than us – it was so bright that is would be simply impossible to not see if outdoors at the time, even out of ones’ peripheral vision. If anyone else has witnessed this same object that we witnessed, please post and share what you saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/31/12 21:30|Sussex|WI|Unknown|About 3-4 minutes|I was biking with my dog west bound on Ivy Ave. behind Sussex on the main store complex. As I was proceeding I noticed an orange light|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91359.html|13|ndxe201207| I was biking with my dog west bound on Ivy Ave. behind Sussex on the main store complex.  As I was proceeding I noticed an orange light in the sky moving very slow like a helicopter coming out the south.  It was about at 230 degrees from my west bound position. It was not making any noise I could here.  It was moving slow then made a turn to the west and appeared to start climbing and accelerating.  From that moment in a matter of seconds it went out of sight.  Then another object came out the south following the same path as the first object and exited to the west in the same way the first object did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I may add I am a private pilot and notice aircraft all the time when I am outside.  This object that I witnessed was not an aircraft of any kind I have ever seen.  The fact that I could not hear the object was very strange.  Also the acceleration to the west was very unusual.  There were two teenagers on bikes that were passing by going east bound and turned around to see what I was watching.  They noticed the object was unusual and asked me what that was. I said to them, &#34;I don’t know but it is not an airplane.&#34;   I could not see the objects shape or size due to bright orange light.  Also, I could not estimate the altitude or distance either.  But to give a comparison I thought it could be a helicopter at about 2000 feet, but there were no strobe lights and no red and green marker lights flashing, just an orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was sighted at 21:30 cst in Sussex Wi.<n>

It was between nine and ten pm and dark enough that I could not see the body of the object, just its lights against the dark sky.  The object was on the other side of the Columbia River over Franklin County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very slowly and with no well-defined direction.  The shape and color of the light seemed to change but over all the color appeared to be orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was similar to the report included in the Tri-City Herald of August 2 except that I did not see individual lights.  What I thought distinguished it from an aircraft were its 1) very slow speed, 2) very large light, and 3) the color of the light, which was not a well-defined white or red.<n>

I was looking north in between 9- 9:30 pm. I got off my car because it was a full moon Tuesday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main object was in the very back and had two smaller objects in the front all gliding in a single file order.  All three crafts were precise when turning to trail one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The one in the back had three white lights on all used in high beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two smaller crafts were trying to lead the bigger craft that was in the back as if it weren’t trying to get spotted by the airport light tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The middle craft had two lights on both white colored and were low beamed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft in the front had two lights on, one red one white while both were flickering.  Both lights were in low beams for the front craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They must have been 30-40 ft. apart from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They came in from the north maybe Spokane, WA and left going towards Yakima, Wa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photos were taken using a 2.0 mega pixel camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was close enough to the ground (a few hundred feet?) to see what appeared like a clear canopy over a solid, dark-coloured base.  It didn&#39;t seem to be manned but that might have been due to the angle from which we were viewing it, or the canopy might not have been transparent. It was silent and travelling at a steady speed, neither very fast nor slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it disappear into the distance through a gap in the houses.  It followed a straight trajectory and maintained a constant speed.<n>

It was approximately a half-hour after sunset.  As I got to the cross walk, I look up and saw them in the sky above the buildings ahead of me; they were traveling in that direction (easterly). I thought I should record them on my iPhone, and looked down momentarily to pull out my phone and bring up the camera app.  By the time I did (just a few seconds), all but two of the objects had disappeared, and those two were now headed in a northerly direction much closer to the horizon.   They seemed to be moving fast, and I was wondering where the other objects had gone so quickly.  There was not enough time to record them (it was a matter of seconds); I just watched them disappear into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a believer in UFOs, but found this quite unusual. I scoured the papers the next day to see if there was a story of any kind.  I finally found your Web site, which contained two similar sightings to mine that same evening in the same neighborhood.<n>

We were sitting at a round table, I was facing out toward the city, and I could see most of the towers in the city.  I was visiting with my family and looking out at the buildings, when I saw a yellow/gold object kind of glide out from behind the tower I was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way it moved almost looked like it was floating on water or something as it came in and out of view from behind this skyscraper.  Just really smooth hovering, gliding, deliberate motion.  It was coming out from the left side of the building and going back behind it.  It never crossed to the other visible side of the building kept coming out the left side.  It did this over and over for a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance was a mile away I would guess.  It did not look very large.  This object did this for a couple minutes until another object came into view.  Almost looked like it appeared, or went from very small to visible, or like it came from far away into view to look just like the first one my family and I have been watching now for a few  minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Remind you, this rooftop was completely full, but I didn’t see anyone else looking at it, but we were.  The two objects stayed for another 30 seconds or so, kind of hovered around a bit until a 3rd object came down, almost like it was telling the other 2 to come back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw all three there for about 8 seconds, the third a bit smaller because it was further away, until all three took off.  When they took off they got smaller and smaller like they flew away very, very quickly.  They didn’t just disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Universal Studios, CA Back Lot Tour  UFO Photo<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello,  My Family and I( Me, my Wife, and 3 boys ages 17,13, &amp; 10) recently took a Vacation for a week in Southern California. We drove in from Texas and took countless photos of the scenic landscape of New Mexico, Arizona, and California. We visited Magic Mountain, Universal Studios, and many other sights around Southern California. Along the way in New Mexico we were taking several pictures , joking about capturing  UFO’s, of course because of Roswell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were headed back to Texas looking at all our photos from 4 different cameras, my 13 yr old said “Dad look at this”, at first I said how did you do that, that’s a pretty real looking picture.  He took pictures with his Ipod during the trip.  He swore he did nothing to the photo and it is original. I got goosebumps because it was a creepy looking saucer in the upper center of the photo,  I was hoping to get clarity on what it may be.  Could it be an Airplane, bird, or is it an Unidentified Flying object. I won’t let him dele! te the photo until we have some clarity. It was taken during the Back lot tour at Universal Studios Hollywood on 7.31.2012. At approximately  8pm. Thank you for your time.<n>

I looked up in the sky between a section of trees and I saw a very bright object traversing the sky from South to North at an extremely high rate of speed.  It was probably twice the size and brightness that Jupiter is at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between this section of trees the object took less than 3 seconds to move through.  I figure that to go from horizon to horizon this object took about 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen satellites, aircraft and missiles and have never seen anything going this fast.<n>

I looked up and heading North to South over the valley were 15-20 redish orangish lights. I t was a partially cloudy night and they were above the clouds.  They stuck together moving in formation, but were weaving in and out of each other in a pattern that looked like the greek lower case lambda symbol.  It was like watching synchronized swimmers as they changed position so the formation changed shape, all the while maintaining the same speed and direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d say it/they stayed visable for a min as they passed out of sight into the clouds to the south.

It first appeared in the W/SW sky from my position and seemed to be moving in a S/SW heading.  The color and brightness of this object was very soul stirring.  It seemed to hover or move slowly near its position at first, then it appeared to gain elevation and move in an arc trajectory towards the S/SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sighting lasted for about 40 seconds.  After recognizing that what I was seeing was not natural, I took out my phone and started recording video (about 5 seconds after first seeing the orb.)  However, it only took a couple glances at the screen to see that what I was recording would not be very clear/detailed.  I then focused mostly on the object itself and watched it move until I finally lost sight of it behind a large Douglas Fir tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still can&#39;t quite wrap my head around the type of fire-like orange light this object generated.  The movement was also outside the norm of any craft I&#39;ve ever seen.  I&#39;d really love to know what caused this phenomenon...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I saw a flying object that was a bright light and i said to myself that looks like a UFO.  It then came down over the top of the trees and followed me for over an hour. It dropped a flare like lazer bluish-white down in front of my car to get my attention but they didnt know they already had it.  I was not scared because this happened to me going over the 84 bridge in Palo Alto, Ca.  That time they dropped a green laser light in front of my car on a sunday morning at 0745 am.  Anyway I stopped to get gas and to told the station guy what just happened with the laser light dropping in front of my car.  I tried to play it off as a falling a star but told him it dropped from the top of the trees.  He smiled at me and said the same thing happened earlier that evening with him at the station.  He told me they are around there on a daily basis.  So i got in my car and left and within a few hours I was so sleep! y i pulled over and fell asleep sitting stright up in a car for over an hour.  Thats it.  Dont remember anything else that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This locust flew by us as he was buzing the tower several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next evening I was sitting on my back porch smoking and I noticed an flat white orb in front of my garage.  I also noticed two red lights next to it.  I didn&#39;t know if it was a spirit or an ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I decided at that point that I would give it something.  I went inside and got something, but when I came back, it was gone.  I knew it would be back the next day, and it was.

It was a clear day with just a few small clouds in the sky.  I noticed a white dot on the sky that appeared to change brightness from fairly dull to very bright.  The object was floating in the sky and appeared to drift slowly away from my position (I first noticed the object approx. 3 - 5 miles away and it appeared to be at least 2-4000 feet in altitude.)   I initially thought it was a mylar balloon reflecting sunlight except it began to exhibit strange behavior.  The object was moving away from mt location towards the NW.   After about 2 minutes it appeared to stop moving and got very bright.  It then would change brightness from very bright to almost invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing that happened was probably the most interesting.  After about 2 minutes the object changed direction and started to move back towards me.  It continued to vary in brightness but also started to dissapear for about a second and then it would re-appear in a slightly different position, moving across the sky now parallel to my position (moving from North to South).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object got the closest to my position, I could see a silver round shape with what looked like a black shadow on the bottom (only visible as the light dimmed).  The object was still several thousand feet up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it for about another 45 seconds and then it just vanished, not to be seen again.   I walked around my backyard continuing to look for it but was unable to see it again.<n>

With a small digital camera, I recorded photos and video.  Samples of photos and video will, as in previous sightings I have reported, be provided via e-mail/links to NUFORC for review.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the sighting two other witnesses joined me for at least a portion of the time:  (1) another resident of the house (the son of the landlord), and (2) a maintenance person who was returning from an errand to complete a sink repair in my home.  I pointed the object out to them.  We were all perplexed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was not stationary, but moved around in the sky for about 50 minutes, varying in brightness, altitude and relative visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A local UFO reporting / research group (to which I belong) agreed that the object does not appear to be a balloon or star.  I believe the following could also be ruled out:  airplane, helicopter, standard drone, plastic bag, glider, satellite, bird, toy/kite, blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: At the end of the sighting, chemtrail activity was observed to begin.  It is unclear as to whether this could have been related to the observed incident.  A separate 2009 sighting I reported (which included similar activity) resulted in the NUFORC informing me that chemtrail activity appears not to be a real phenomenon.  Again, as in 2009, it is not my intention to debate the topic of chemtrails, but rather to report the details of the crafts / orbs I observe.  These reports sometimes include airplane activity during or after the event that creates visible contrails or &#34;chemtrails.&#34;  SAMPLE PHOTOS AND VIDEO LINK WILL BE SENT TO NUFORC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my fifth UFO sighting report to NUFORC.  The other four were for sightings that took place on: 1.  2/6/97 (Mesa, AZ)---Original report was updated with map.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  4/26/09 (Brooklyn, NY)---Orb 3.  5/14/11 (Brooklyn, NY)---Lights 4.  7/10/11 (Brooklyn, NY)---Brilliant light / orb (NOTE: this is a resubmission of this report.

While we were talking I spotted something to the left of us that I thought was an airplane at first becuase it was flying at a normal ordinary airplane/ aircraft pace. It caught my attention and I observed it some more. Although was flying at a normal type of pace, it was flying very unsually low and started to slow down, until it came to a stop right over what looked like Chatfield Lake.  The object had about 6 horizontal very bright white lights on the bottom of the craft.  As I stare at this before my eyes, the object does not move for a good 5 minutes.  It just stayed hovering there and then disappered. It was such a surreal thing to see. I had even forgot where I was going and drove about 3 miles in the wrong direction just because I could not keep my eyes off of this thing. I had even forgot my friend was in the drivers seat. I look over at her and she has the same astonished loo! k on her face. What we saw was real life.

It was headed in the same direction but did not follow the same path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One minute later a third appeared and did the same thing as the first two.  I tried to record it but as it was night my phone had a hard time capturing it.  When I turned the flash on it only made it blurry, by the time I switched to flash off, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I know there&#39;s a meteor shower the 28-29 of July but these were no stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we thought maybe an asteroid but thought it was weird there was no trail, they moved slow, were cloud height and all came from the same area ! and headed in the same direction.  They were NOT planes, there was no blinking lights and planes aren&#39;t a ball of reddish orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately a half hour later, we were back outside again and my husband saw a bright blue light flash through the sky.  I however, did not because I wasnt looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brain wants to determine what those lights were, but I can&#39;t for the life of me come up with a logical explanation other than a Unidentified Flying Object.  I will never forget what I saw, as this is the first sightings we ever had.<n>

It wasn&#39;t a flourescent colored light but more of a pumking color orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I only noticed one bright light but as it was getting closer I did see a much smaller light on the right side. I was watching it out of curiosity mostly because I hadnt ever seen a orange light from an airplane plus it was moving quite slowly so it struck me as unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My camera was right behind me on a small table so I stepped back about 2 feet to grab my camera. When I turned back towards the sliding glass door, I could barely see the light and it was ALL the way back over to where I originally noticed it, basically on the other side of the lake where I first noticed it. I did snap two shots however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about 2-3 seconds, the light was gone. It took a little more than 2 minutes for it to get as close as it did and within seconds it was where it started from, or atleast from where I first noticed it. I&#39;m wondering if anybody seen anything like this from lastnight?  I did take a picture but couldnt see anything after I went back to review the shot. I zoomed in to 16x and was able to notice a dim blue light in the sky where the object was at.<n>

We were startled. We thought our city was going to become attacked. However, these objects were not planes.  They made no noise.  They were moving slowly but steadily at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flashed red like a ball of fire. They would come together and then break apart.  Then they would fade as they would rise straight up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to walk north down 39th ave, a womn in front of me had also noticed the strange orbs in the sky and was on the phone to her girlfriend to come out and look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began speaking to the women and we watched the sky.  We were at the corner of 39th and Holgate.  The lights continued coming from the west over the city of Portland and moved north up 39th ave.  Traffic had come to a stop and drivers noticed the lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This lasted for 15 minutes.  One orb began to come in closer to us and then it faded and went straight up in the sky and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have some of this on video from my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were lights on this orb.<n>

Was BRIGHT orange (I mean very very orange), yet very distant.  Easily 10x brighter than Venus.  It seemed distant, but was moving VERY fast in what seemed to be a straight line.  Probably moved across about 90 degrees of sky in about 1-2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is about 10 miles south of Buffalo, NY.  It was moving from southwest to northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear, starry, yet in the direction the thing was moving I had seen very strong lightning minutes earlier, possibly heat lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashes illuminated the sky/clouds in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked weather radar and did see a small thunderstorm cell in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know for a fact it was not a passenger jet or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found it incredibly unusual and immediately told my girlfriend about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went back out and watched for a while but saw nothing else unusual.<n>

The streets were being cleared from the Belle Chere Festival.  There were very few pedestrians on the street.  We were planning on going stargazing that evening, so I glanced up at a patch of blue sky to the south of us, when I saw a large cigar/cylindrical shaped object moving across the sky.  It looked like a shiny silver cigar...flying at about the same distance, and speed that a commercial aircraft would be traveling, only there was no com-trail, and no noise.  I was able to point the object out to my other three companions.  Everyone saw it move across the sky, and then disappear into a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as it disappeared, another identical craft came into view, and it followed the same path, eventually disappearing into the same cloud cover.  It was very strange.  If anyone else saw these objects, please post!<n>

It was moving more slowly than the planes that I often see above my suburban estate and was not blinking or flashing the way plane lights do.  It was an hour past sundown so the sky was dark and there were stars out and light cloud here and there.  As I watched it head from the north east towards the south-west I saw two other lights, that were exactly the same as the first, come into my field of view from behind the tall trees two streets away.  The first light stopped and seemed to wait for the other two lights which slid into place behind and either side of the first, forming the three points of a triangle, before all three began to move slowly south-west together.  They emitted no sound that we were able to perceive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my mother out to watch them and she agreed how strange they were.  She said it looked like the head lights and wing lights of a very, very large yet invisible plane, such was the unformity of their movement ( see points below for vague illustration of position).<n> <n><n> <n><n> .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .<n> <n><n> <n><n> .<n> <n><n> <n><n> After continuing south-west for about three minutes the lights seemed to stop dead and I felt like they were watching us.  Mum (who&#39;s in her seventies) went back inside, bewildered and I went in to grab my camera.  When I returned less than a minute later, there was no sign of them.  They may have disappeared into the light cloud but should have eventually come out however they didn&#39;t in the next 20 minutes I watched for them.  I did notice that an aircraft did enter into the zone from which the second and third spheres had first originated in the 20 minutes after our sighting.  This patch of sky is not on any of the flight paths that extend over and around my house.  I have lived here for six years and am regularly in the backyard at night smoking cigarettes so I know the traffic of the sky here very well and these lights were like nothing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am willing to entertain the idea that they may have been Chinese lanterns, as apparently they move with the absolute uniformity possessed by the lights we saw, and the wind was out of the ENE that evening, which would mean they were heading with the wind.  Also no other sightings of these lights have been reported which, given the time, leads me to believe they were local and lends credence to the Chinese lantern theory. However, there was absolutely no flickering or wavering of the lights of any kind.  They were a solid orange with a light pink haze surrounding them.  I&#39;m not sure whether that is how Chinese lanterns are perceived by observers.  If it is, then the mystery is solved, but if not, these lights were indeed UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was driving on county road 19 - a very dark rural stretch of road between New Prague and Lonsdale, MN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can only describe what I witnessed as a huge burst of light, as if an enormous photo flash went off, just behind/over the tree line to my left.  The center of the light burst was obstructed by the tree line, but the edge of the &#34;burst&#34;  had a pinkish hue to it.  (The burst was quite bright.  I literally said out loud to myself, &#34;What was THAT?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then,a moment later, just to the right of the burst and slightly higher than the flash - again- just above the tree line - were two vertical &amp;quot;laser&amp;quot; type beams, seeming to emanate vertically from a center point.  The two beams of light were perfectly vertical, and perfectly crisp...like a laser, but fanned out and dissipated slightly at the furthest most points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flash disappeared almost instantly.  The beams of light appeared immediately following the flash. I was able to look directly at the beams and recognize exactly what I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made 2 cell phone calls immediately after, and noted signal issues during my first call.  Also, my car stereo reception became fuzzy at this time.  (This may or may not be related to the event. I was in a rural area...but have not experienced car stereo static on this route before.)   I&#39;ve researched everything I can find - from northern lights, to &#34;sprites&#34; and &amp;quot;blue lasers.&#34;.  This was NOT accurately depicted in any astronomical phenomenon I&#39;ve read about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still flustered by what I saw.<n>

Specifically Kill Devil Hills, NC.  On Friday July 29th 2012 at about 3am we were outside in the area pool when I looked up and saw 2 round bright lights, which it looked liked initially, headed in our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was it looked like a commercial airliner coming towards us.  I was surprised on how close this object was in the night sky.  After watching for a few moments it was clear they were 2 round balls of orange fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They stayed parallel to each other as they moved across the sky moving from north to south. They weren&#39;t streaking in the sky and there was no apparent tail behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for about 20-25 seconds and as they moved above us, they then faded away at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 seconds later, another single round ball of orange fire followed about the same path, about another 20-25 seconds and faded away in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, about 10-15 seconds later, a larger ball of fire, this time more reddish in color followed and faded away in the same area in the sky.  During the entire event, no sound was emitted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four of us witnessed this event and cannot come to a conclusion to what it was.  I&#39;ve scoured the internet and haven&#39;t been able to find a sighting reported in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I had my phone with me as I&#39;m sure I could of recorded very clear images or video, but unfortunately I did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any information you can provide me with would be greatly appreciated.<n>

7/29/12 00:35|Saskatoon (Canada)|SK|Triangle|30 seconds|V-shaped ufo over Saskatoon.|12/12/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105234.html|64|ndxe201207| V shaped ufo over Saskatoon<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 12:30 Saturday morning.  I went outside to have a cigarette and look at the night sky. It was a clear night with the moon in the south east of the sky.  It was a big, bright moon. There were a few light wispy clouds, but almost completely clear, dark night.  I looked at the sky for while, then let my eyes adjust by staring at a blank area of the black sky.  That&#39;s when I saw a light, it had the intensity of a brighter starlight, moving from the south. In the first instance I saw the moving light I thought it was a satellite or other regular object. I am used to seeing a variety of things in the night sky.  That is when I noticed two more exact same lights behind the first.  The lights were in a dark part of the sky with no clouds at first. I could not figure out what was moving up there. Whatever is was, it was at altitude.  The 3 lights moved in unison.  Then the craft went under a wispy cloud, and with the moon that night, it was just like someone standing up in front of a movie theater screen.  I got a clear look at the shape of the craft.  As the craft went under the cloud I saw that it was a (what I thought) was a delta shaped craft.  And I thought &#34;wow a stealth bomber must be coming in&#34;.  Then, as the craft continued under the cloud and more of it came into clear view, I noticed that it was a V shaped craft. Clearly a V, like a carpenters square.  It was not a B2 or a stealth fighter. It was big, my initial thought was that 2 747&#39;s could land on one wing of the V craft. The span from tip to tip of the rear tips had to be at least 6 or 7 747&#39;s apart. It was huge. It was not a UAV or remote controlled craft. It was at altitude and huge. It had no aviation lights, just the 3 lights that were like stars at each point of the V. When the craft went under the cloud, you could not see the 3 &#34;star lights&#34;, only the outline of the craft. As the craft left the cloud, it was like the craft went invisible again. The cr! aft continued north. As it went away, all I could see 3 glowin! g red ha lf orbs, all side by side. They glowed red, not bright red, but like a low watt red light bulb. The craft made no sound, absolutely silent. I estimate the speed to be approximately 100 to 150 mph due to distance it traveled in that time. It went perfectly straight heading south to north. I know this sounds crazy but when I see some of the images that people drew of the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34;, I see the same thing I saw that night. It was real. It was not a plane, jet, remote UAV, or anything else I have ever seen. If I had not looked at the sky like I did that night, I would have never had known it was going over my head. I have hoped to hear of someone else in Saskatoon that saw the same thing that night but I have not. There is Sept 26/13 report on this site with a drawing by someone in Turlock, California of a V-shaped craft very similar to what I saw, but his drawing has too many lights, I saw only 3, but other that that, it was the same.<n>

7/28/12 23:55|Budapest (Hungary)||Formation|5 minutes|Fixed formation of about one hundred bright spots in the night sky|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91290.html|67|ndxe201207| Fixed formation of about one hundred bright spots in the night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my girlfriend was on vacation in Budapest, Hungary this week.  We had rented an old, pretty nice, apartment very close to the parliament building of Hungary.  We both had trouble sleeping, so we went out on the balcony just before midnight for a smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly I spot what I first believe is a flock of birds flying gently through the night sky.  I keep looking at these strange birds and wonder how come they glow.  The sky is pitch dark, so the only way for them to be seen is if something is shining on them from below.  The flock slowly move through the sky, and they keep the same glow all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a second it suddenly comes to me that this cannot be birds.  There are about a hundred spots in the sky, in a fixed, stretched (not even) formation.  Fortunately there were a lot of sky outside our balcony (there was a park, so no walls hid the sight).  I kept looking at the formation for about 5 minutes, before they no longer were in my visible area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two spots came a little later.  The last of them seemed to consist of two bright spots, rotation very closely to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fixed formation and the quantity of the spots makes me really confused.  I have absolutely NO idea what this might have been.  I remember thinking that it looked like a slice of the night sky was moving (it looked like stars).<n> <n><n> <n><n> They made no sound that I could hear at all.<n>

We saw, to the right of the highway, about 100 feet above tree level, a bright orange/white light hovering, no sound.  As I continued driving, to the left a huge, bright, boulder-like ball of flame appeared out of no where and shot to the earth from the same distance level as the object to the right of the highway, into an area nearest Wolf Creek swamps.   The shining yellowish-white object flew in a decline of about 70 degrees.  I expected to hear a &amp;quot;kaBoom&amp;quot;, but there was absolutely no sound following its crash into wherever.  There was no trail of light behind it.  Suffice to say, the two people I was driving and I were in shock.  After dropping off one of the parties, my daughter and I continued driving on Derby toward Germantown in Jefferson Twnshp.  We noticed a second red glowing object hovering further southwest.  Turning East ! from Derby onto Germantown we spotted yet another, brighter low-hovering object.  This one was slowly gliding toward the west coming right toward our direction.  I opened my sunroof and moments later, my daughter and I was seeing the underbelly of what appeared to be a spheric object inside a diamond-shaped exterior, with lights on each of the 4 corners, the sphere was being held by some type of pole-like shape from each of the interior angles to that of the center object.  Upon driving past it, my daughter screamed that the object broke up into three separate parts and went in different directions!!!!!!<n>

This time we noted that there was absolutely no sound associated with the objects.  The night was completely silent.  At this time we retrieved a pair of high powered binoculars and we&#39;re able to thoroughly observe the next 4 objects that flew by in the same direction (2 at a time approximately 5 min appart).  The objects observed through the binoculars were just a diffuse orange light with no other lights and no sign of a visible shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time we called 911 who patched us through to the coast guard who said there were no training maneuvers or rescues occuring at this time and all of their choppers were on the ground.  We then discussed the possibility of f-15 training flights out of PDX who were lighting their afterburners but due to our close Proximity to the lights and their complete silence this seems unlikely.<n>

He jokingly mentioned ufos. I watched it move west to east moving from tree line to tree line of visibility in a horizontal path.  2 more orbs followed suit after.  There were lightning flashes from a thunderstorm in the general area where they were spotted.  It almost looked like the objects were using the storm to hide, and 1 orb acted as a scout for the other 2 orbs.  They did not have any blinking lights like standard aircraft, or make any noticeable sound.<n>

While I was watering I hear my girlfriend yell &amp;quot;what the bleep is that in the sky?!&amp;quot; When I turned around and looked up there were two balls of pulsating light hovering in the sky. They pulsated from a deep red to a bright orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they were motionless, lined up one on top of the other. Then, the one on top slowly descended to the lower one and they came very close to touching. It was obvious these things were being controlled/maneuvered.  There was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They hovered for what seemed to be about 3-5 minutes and then slowly dimmed and flew off, changing speeds from very slow to rather quick movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked for any reports around this area, something i&#39;ve never done before and I have noticed that more people are seeing similar things around this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know tonight there was a meteor shower, but these objects were not meteors or comet debris. I spend enough time star gazing to know the difference.  These objects descended then ascended, never fully disappearing until they flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this in my life and it was a rather disturbing experience for my girlfriend.<n>

I wish I had the footage I took with my iPhone of the first set of 6 or so as they were more &#34;acrobatic&#34; (accidently deleted during sync), but I did take video from my camcorder too that still captures the essence of what we witnessed that evening.  Hard to explain, but intriguing enough that I thought it was worth reporting. I ended it abruptly after the last one jetted away and the sky went dark again.  Each disappeared the same way - they shook violently then seemed to just disappear.  These balls rose relatively quickly, I&#39;d guess them to reach speeds of 150-200 mph as they ascended.  But then they would just stop, and sit, and hover for a while.  As I zoomed in, I saw that before they disappeared, they shook erratically and became hard to keep a steady view of.   At the end of my clip you&#39;ll see a great illustration of what I mean - a great close up of this illuminated &#34;orb.&#34;.  These balls apeared to pulsate and seemed to almost make patterns, such as triangles and lines.<n>

I noticed two bright red lights moving east about a hand-length apart, one in front of the other.  The first light stopped mid-flight and the second continued to move and disappeared into the clouds.  About 20 seconds later the other did the same, I suppose rising vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued viewing that portion of the sky and another two red lights appeared, one in front of the other, this time further apart.  The red light went out on the first object revealing a circular disk in perspective as if it was 90 degrees to the ground aloft.  It was about the size of thumbtack held at arms length and grey in color.  The latter red light continued to shine red and disappeared into the clouds.  Then I watched the small circular disk until it was obscured by buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I teach design courses in college and live across from Boston&#39;s Logan International airport.  I spent time viewing the stars, satellites and so forth and have never seen such a sequence of objects.  This is my first visit to Berlin, but not Europe, and I am not sure what is expected in the sky here, but the behavior of these objects seemed so puzzling that I thought it might be useful to report them.<n>

They were traveling across the sky, one after the other.   They all seemed to travel the same flight path but were somewhat sporadic in timing and distance.  A couple of times two would be in real close proximity to each other, one a little bit higher than the other.  Each sphere looked like a combination of white, red and yellow, which in turn gave them an overall look of an orange glow as they moved across the sky.  A couple of them were a little more red in color.  Two of the spheres seemed to drop something that looked like a burning ember off the bottom of them which slowly disappeared as they were falling.  Eventually all the spheres would turn more to the south and disappear once they reached the western area of the sighting.<n>

There was cloud cover and as they slowly drifted into the clouds , they went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a very heavy airplane traffic route. Between Newark and Teterboro airport , I see and hear planes and helicopters all the time.  The objects made no sound that I could hear and moved too slow to be planes.  There were no blinking lights, just the red/orange glow. A bit of a scintillation to them, but it&#39;s has been raining and there is clouds and some humidity in the air.  I only observed the objects for about 5 mins, before they moved up into the cloud cover,  This is were the dimmed and I could no longer se the lights.  I went home looked out my window at the same area of sky for some time, but only saw the regular air traffic of planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went online to the weather channel and local airport radar to see what the cloud cover height was, it says &amp;quot;broken clouds at a height of 1400 feet&amp;quot; &amp;quot;winds at 10 mph from the north&amp;quot; I can&#39;t be sure how high in the air they were. but the did move along the horizon for just a bit before the moved upward into the clouds.<n>

We came to a stop sign at approximately 9:15 pm, when a very bright white object caught my attention in the sky.  There had been storms in the area, and a dark cloud behind the object made it stand out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly asked my son if he saw this object, which he acknowledged he did. There were no other vehicles on the road, so we stayed stopped at the intersection and observed the object for a moment. I had never seen anything like this before in person, and reached for my iphone to begin filming. When I fixed the screen into the sky, we noticed a second object appear to the left. It was also white in color. Not a moment later, a much brighter and somewhat larger red object appeared to the right. All of the objects can best be described as fireballs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son quickly pointed out that they were in a triangular formation. They stayed in that formation for a very short period of time, while they began to slowly change color from red, orange, and white. The object on the lower left of the triangle began to disappear, almost as if it was a burning out fire. At this point we pulled over to the side of the road, and got out of our vehicle to continue viewing the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two remaining objects continued to change color, and their brightness would vary. At times, they were very brilliant. They slowly moved closer, while also changing elevations. Once they were at what appeared to be the same elevation, the object to left seemed to disappear in similar fashion to the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to view the object without looking through the iphone screen, so turned the video off at this point. A few seconds later, the final object also simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove up the road in the direction of the objects, trying to see if we could locate them again. We did not have any luck, they had just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In general, these fireballs were much brighter than any star, satellite, or space station. They were also roughly 5 times greater in size than a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound was audible at any point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 39 years old, and my son who was with me is 11.<n>

I know the shape because we graphed these in calculus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First seen by wife.  She was taking the trash out, leaving the front door, which faces north, when she saw the bright lights.  She watched this for about  2 minutes then ran to the back yard, where I was at the time, to tell me to look.  She stood out front for a while before coming to get me because she wanted to see what these weird things are.  She thought we were in danger.  Because of the formation of the flying ships my wife thought that maybe it was some military planes that may be coming to bomb us.  My wife was scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (This drawing, that did not paste, illustrates 3 ships with bright red on the shape of a hypo cycloid of four cusps and bright white light on the inside)    Seen by me and my wife in the back yard.

Note that the red and white illuminations of the ships were very bright, not like a normal airplane or any jets I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (This drawing, that did not paste, illustrates 4 ships with bright red in the shape of a hypo cycloid of four cusps and bright white light on the inside)    Seen by me while my wife is getting the camera. Fourth unit came as soon as my wife went in the house. This flying vehicle came from the atmosphere, not from the horizon like a typical plane would come. The ships were at about a 40 degree angle with a level line at this time. and the lights were getting brighter as if they were coming closer to our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (This drawing, that did not paste, illustrates 5 ships with bright red in the shape of a hypo cycloid of four cusps and bright white light on the inside)    Seen by me and my wife. The fifth ship came from the atmosphere while my wife was getting the camera. Basically, it looked like the flying ship came from space. The ships were at about a 50 degree angle with a level line. The lights were brighter as if they were closer to our location. We watched this for about 20 to 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: My wife was in a hurry to grab her camera, the fourth and fifth flying ship arrived in about 10 to 20 seconds.

Mr. Davenport asked be to briefly explain what I have seen.  He did not want to tell me about other peoples reports and he then told me to write a report.  He said he would talk to me more after sending in a report.  He said he did not want to taint my report by talking about what other people have reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note I took a picture.

It was between 9:00 and 10:00 PM, I was looking at the stars with my husband in our swing as we do often.  This is the 2nd time in my life this has happened, it was as if something was telling me to look at a specific place, deep, deep out in the sky.  It was in the southeast direction, I was looking deep in to the sky, focusing deeper &amp; deeper, and I saw an explosion.  It couldn&#39;t have lasted but between 2 &amp; 3 seconds.  It was a reddish-orange color, exploded outward - similar to that of a huge firework - starting in a center and expanding outward into a flat, round shape, similar to the rings around Saturn. It lit brighter as it went outward, changing from red to orange, then disapated, yet couldn&#39;t have last more than 3 seconds.  Was it a meteor blasted by someone? Thats all I can guess. I can&#39;t forget it, yet haven&#39;t told many people what I witnessed. I had that &amp;quot;calling&amp;quot; one ! other time, I can remember it was in August in the late 1990&#39;s.  It was a little more south, south-east.  It was an explosion but was different, it left like a smoke ring that lasted 2 to 3 seconds also.  Again, I never told many people, and I haven&#39;t forgotten it either.  I could not tell the distance of either, but believe it was further than the distance of the moon.  It certainly wasn&#39;t close.  Both times it was like I was being told to look at a precise place at a precise time, looking deep into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was nothing blinking, and no sound.  I said &amp;quot;What is that&amp;quot; and my husband looked and said he didn;t know. i DO believe in UFO&#39;s, but he does not!  He said, &#34;What happened to it?&#34;  because it blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw 4 more coming from the same direction, in a row.  They moved along the same path, then just faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I had run to get the binoculars, but when we both took turns looking, all we really saw was a lighted round-like orange color shape.

We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert At 8:30 P.M. on the 27th of July, 2012, my husband and I were walking our dogs and saw several UFO’s at the end of our street. We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert in North Phoenix near Cave Creek, AZ. and always enjoy the view. The mountains and horizon looked like a postcard and the horizon was purplish blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I gazed up at the sky, I noticed that there were a lot of trails crossing the sky. In fact, the sky was full of them. And there seemed to be a gigantic X in the sky where two of the largest ones crossed each other. My husband and I thought that this was very odd indeed. On further reflection, it seemed that the X marked a meeting spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed that coming from the north, very high in the horizon, what appeared at first to be a plane was not a plane at all. It was soundless, for one thing and moved erratically.  I could not believe my eyes. It jumped around sporadically in a fashion that no plane is capable of doing. As it jumped, it blinked, and then it hovered, waiting. Why was it waiting?  Then we noticed that an actual plane ( or what seemed at first to be a plane) was some distance from it but seemed to have some connection with this object as well as the other unidentified flying objects. This first one would not continue on its path until the plane- or what appeared to be a plane- turned off its lights. At that point, the object flew in a southernly direction in a slightly more normal path though at no time did any of them have the noise of a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened several times. We saw seven of them, and they did not all appear to be exactly the same though they all did act in an erratic fashion. Some had orangish lights and some had greenish lights. Some were bigger than others and seemed to have lights that blinked as if they were  rotating discs. The smallest of these were more cigar or bullet shaped and the size of a plane, but two seemed to be much larger. One was in the shape of a triangle. We watched fascinated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before we left, one of the very largest ones first hovered and then headed in the opposite direction. It first headed closer to us and then followed us across the street like a low flying plane above the trees which made me feel quite uneasy indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Except for the last one, we lost sight of all objects over the horizon or they seemed to just disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, while this was going on at one point we looked at the moon and it was clear. Five minutes later there was a distinct trail across it- like a long line. There were no lights moving in the area. If it was created by a chemtrail in the area, then the flying object had no lights as we saw nothing saw cross the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is odd that they all came from the same exact place and seemingly from out of nowhere.  We watched them as they appeared. My husband  now suggests it was perhaps from the area of 51 Las Vegas. They all headed in the same direction ( seemed to be Goldwater Preserve SW of Phoenix). We could not identify any landing. One flew back to the point of origin, inexplicably. The rest, five, continued on out of our sight except for the last one which followed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be a convoy mission of some sort ( some escorting others into the area that they were all headed).  The “plane” that shut its lights off and then on from the object waiting to make its flight seemed to be giving it a signal to pass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, not only was their behavior bizarre (hovering and stationary and then deep ascents or descents), soundless, and erratic, but they appeared to have come from a much greater distance than a plane possibly could. When they first appeared, they seemed to be brighter than the brightest star, so perhaps that gives some indication of size and distance. It seems as if they came out of thin air and were at first at a much greater distance. In fact, at first they looked star like, then like several  bright points that jumped around a bit( to get stabilized?) and then, coming closer (it appeared) into our atmosphere, you could detect some type of shape with lights (green or red) at the bottom of the unidentified flying object.  They all moved noiselessly unlike planes and were able to move in a manner unlike any plane. We did not take our eyes off of them, but I had the creepy feeling with some of them that they were trying to approximate the look of a plane once they began to f! ly in the same southwesterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, planes do not shut their lights off or hover and come to a standstill, planes do not come out of nowhere as far away as a star then jump in inexplicable patterns, and planes do not fly noiselessly.  I was not sure whether or not they actually changed their shape or the shape came into focus as it came closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are serious, well-educated, and professional people and have no reason to be making this up.<n>

It appears as if I am not the only one who has seen them, however I see no reports of this in Las Vegas yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way home last night and I made a right turn onto a surface street (facing north) and saw the orange lights flying in the sky.  Others were slamming on their brakes and I assumed a speed trap, but they had seen them as well.  I didn&#39;t get a count of them but I personally saw 10-15 of them.  They were about a football field apart, were orange and flickering like a flame.  It didn&#39;t appear to look like any type of aircraft light to me, and there were no standard red/blue lights on the wings like normal aircraft have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew slowly, but seemed to change direction rather quickly.  They were moving as if they were connected by an invisible string.  Half of them rotated, as if they were pivoting on the center light, and the other half pivoted the other way, pivoting on the center light.  The lights quickly changed from a straight line to almost a letter V, but not perfect like you would expect from military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assumed perhaps it was after-burner light coming from a military plane, so I rolled down the window in my car and sat there.  I heard absolutely nothing.  Everything was completely silent, other than road traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the strangest thing I have seen in a long time.  Las Vegas is the home to Nellis Air Force Base, so I thought maybe it was something coming from there.  But I am thinking that this is unlikely as the circumstances were too odd.<n>

PD))|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91257.html|96|ndxe201207| 2 stars moving in the sky &amp; more<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 2 stars moving high and deep (not so deep but deep) in the sky, the movement were more like in a vertical direction than horizontal (much more vertical, but not totally vertical)  Both stars were moving like one of them wanted to take position where the other one was (Like they were switching positions) But it never looks like they were about to crash or something like that, it looked more like they were switching area or territorial position more than a perfect taking position one over the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of them positioned in the place where the other one was (like i said territorial position not the exact position) The other one that looks it was about to do the same, it didn&#39;t (Both stars were moving at the same time, this part of the event had a duration of 3-4 seconds) Once one of the stars took the territorial position over the other one, stops moving. The other one took territorial position of the other one almost at the same time (Or at the same time, hard to say) didn&#39;t stop moving, this one kept moving and position it self at the other side of the sky (Like if i am with my arms opened this second star moved from one of my hands to my other one over my head, keeping the proportions and it wasn&#39;t exactly a 180 degrees move, thats the best way i can explain it) This star moved extra 9-10 seconds after the other one stops, so in total it moved around 12-14 seconds) I have to say, that the apparent switch it was more like a discovering surprise, when the other star m! oved like that i really freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, this event took like 12-14 seconds. After that both stars stopped moving, i took some seconds (less than a minute probably) to see where these stars where located then  look for another witness and also my camera. I told my friend what i saw, and he told me &amp;quot;i believe you and i don&#39;t want to go outside&amp;quot; so i took the key of my car and looked for my camera that i had inside my car) Then came back to the place i saw the events (All of this probably took me like 90 seconds) I came back, and this is what freaked me out some more:  While looking for the stars in the places i saw them stop from moving when i left, i found them real easy because that was the moment i realized they were not regular stars. They were changing colors from blue to red (being blue the predominant color, sometimes when turning from blue to red i could observe like a regular white bright light, but i didn&#39;t observe this every time so i don&#39;t know if that is an optical illusion or my eyes were tired at some point)  The object that moved for only 3-4 seconds were in the same location when i came back with my camera, but the other one didn&#39;t. I looked around and i didn&#39;t see it, but i saw this really bright star almost in the same location so i guess it was the same star (I am talking about stars because i don&#39;t know, i am trying to give myself my own explanations) This star wasn&#39;t turning colors, it was just a bright star (The most brightest in the sky that night, so bright that my camera got it) I don&#39;t check the video i took in the computer yet, but this bright star was able to appear in the film i took, not the rest of the stars or moving stars my camera was not able to capture them due to the dark and distance (I mean at that time, i think i have video recording of the star that actually change colors in the morning, but let me finish the story)  It was under my perspective at the moment that the brighter star was the star i saw moving from 12-14 seconds. So, i kept focus in that star and the other one (They were in different extreme of my view of the sky, so i couldn&#39;t watch both at the same time)  The other star was still there, not moving but turning from blue to red... Then after about 40 minutes i started to realized that the brighter star in the sky was still the brightest in the sky but not like before so, i started looking in all around the sky, every place, every spot. After 20 minutes i can say with property that they were 5 stars not moving but turning from blue to red. Also (Because i discovered the event around 4.30am) After the sky was a little less dark due to the rise of sun, i could detect that the star that i saw moving for 3-4 seconds was farer than i thought in the first place, and also that this star couldn&#39;t stay easily in the same place, it was like moving (A really hard to detect move) up and ! down, i couldn&#39;t appreciate that in the really dark sky, or maybe at that point my eyes were tired, or it was an optical illusion due to some more light in the sky (I don&#39;t know)  Then in the morning, i was able to film the object that moved from 12-14 seconds, i still don&#39;t see it in my computer but i was able to see it in the screen of my camera when filming.  Also you only will see a point in the sky so i don&#39;t expect to somebody to take that as evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another important thing, during the 2 hours i was there (From about 4.30am and 6.30am) I saw 3 falling stars, i saw falling stars before but always falling stars that born in the sky and die in the sky. These were falling stars that born in the sky and die in the horizon, like they were hitting the ground. I saw this 3 times (The first time was about 12 minutes after i saw the 2 stars moving and closer to the one that only moved for 3-4 seconds (Yes, i freaked out)  Around 6.30am i was able to see in the sky only, the brightest star i saw in the sky the whole night, the second brightest, the 2 stars that moved (There were stars brightest than the ones that moved but i wasn&#39;t able to see them, i don&#39;t know why i was still able to see the star that moved if they were not brighter than other ones that i couldn&#39;t see anymore, at this point i only could see them like a star not blue and red colors anymore) And i was able to see also 1 more of the stars that i didn&#39;t see moving, but i recognized earlier turning blue and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then i decided there is no more reason for being there anymore, and since i was being eaten by mosquitos for 2 hours i went inside the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to say that, i am an industrial engineer, i don&#39;t do drugs, i wasn&#39;t drinking that night or the night before (or the one before that one) And i am not the kind of person who believes stories. I am pretty much a city guy, i have been working in a project in this farm, the sky looks different here as it looks in the city, so maybe what i saw it is normal (I will be looking in the internet more information about what i saw) And maybe by posting here, any of the staff can send me an explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be watching the skies in the following days at the same time to see if i get something again.  Ah yes, i went outside at 4.30am because the restroom that works is in the 2nd floor of the house, and i just went outside to use a tree instead since i was not in the second floor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of planets in the eastern morning sky.

Both had multiple white lights and moved around.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91244.html|99|ndxe201207| Two bright objects seen just below the clouds over southern New Jersey at 3:18am. Both had multiple white lights and moved around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t fall asleep, so I looked out my window and saw what looked like a star.  It moved out of my sight, so I sat up in bed and split my blinds to see.  At that point I realized this object was below the clouds (right at the bottom edge of the clouds because a few times it crossed into them slightly.) I kept watching and thought to myself that it must be a plane or helicopter, but no, then another appeared and I realized they were moving very smoothly in different directions.  The movements were very subtle but I could tell they weren’t moving in a straight line like an airplane would because I compared their position to my blinds. They were kind of just white lights.  I kept eye contact on one and realized it seemed to have one bright light (or big light) in the center and many small lights circling that, like a stereotypical flying saucer I guess.  I think since it was so dark the lights were all I saw, and I really didn’t see a distinct body or shape, but!  because of the placement of the lights I could assume they were somewhat disc shaped and more convex at the top and bottom.  They weren’t flat discs. (more like lemons from the side view.)  By the time I realized one of the two objects was gone, the other was leaving as well.  It became very still, and then the light got smaller rapidly. (Almost as if it zoomed away, but something about it was a little different.  Maybe it was just too fast.) I was the only observer from my point of view, but I hope that other people in my area saw these as well.  For background, I’m a 15 year old girl and I’m going into my sophomore year at high school.  I suppose it might be useful to know that I’m perfectly healthy, physically and mentally.  I also happen to have 20/20 vision, so that’s pretty nice. I also haven’t taken any drugs or medication, and I’m not dehydrated or starved. (I think that might be enough to rule out a hallucination, right?)  I’ve always had an interest in UFO stories but se! eing one right above my home was extremely nerve wracking. At ! this poi nt I’m half-curious and half terrified, but I’m sure these visitors weren’t trying to harm us earthlings. They looked like they were observing us or taking note of something. The way they moved reminded me of the way someone would scan their eyes over their suitcase to make sure they had everything packed. (hopefully you can imagine that.) One last note, thank you to whoever keeps track of this site and thank you to anyone who took the time to read this. I had no idea this sort of service existed and right now I’m glad it does.<n>
7/28/12 03:05|Sault St  Marie (Canada)|ON|Rectangle|10 minutes|Glowing orb with visual view of bottom of craft|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91331.html|100|ndxe201207| Glowing orb with visual view of bottom of craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving west with A 26 foot U-Haul  to Sault St Marie at 3:05 am on July 28th when I  encountered 1 singular large orange orb that was blinking with a strange intensity. It was also moving in a manner unlike any plane with hovering then deep descents and ascents as if it was looking for something. I slowed down my vehicle and went on the shoulder of the road.  I thought it was a helicopter ready to land but there was no sound. The orb seemed to be comming towards my direction (floating, blinking) in a eastern trajectory at approximately 250 feet in the air intersecting above my vehicle. THE FOLLOWING IS WHAT I SAW.  As the Orb passed directly overhead within my upward field of vision,  It continued to blink pulsating Orange bursts.  When it arrived overhead, the Pulsating blink visibly illumated the bottom of the craft for 3 total  blinks before it passed out of view.  The undercarriage was also backlit with darkened contrast due to some bright moonlight ! from the evening sky behind it.  The Blinking seemed to originate from the front section of the vessel only. What it illuminated underneath itself revealed a large rectangular vessel approximately 200 yards long and 150 yards wide.  This was HUGE!.  It is still earie speaking about this because I still have flashbacks about what I saw and my worldview on reality has now changed.  This immense vessel made no sound whatsoever and I noticed from the undercarriage the shimmering effect emanating like heat coming off the dessert sand. It is impossible to suspend such mass in the air with human technology.  I had 3 looks at it and still do not want to beleive what I saw.  Even stranger, after leaving the encounter, I telepathically transmitted to the craft that I knew they were there and that I acknowledged their presence wondering what they are doing here.  As I continued to drive to the Sault, my GPS illogically directed me to go to the US border when the address was for Kenora Ontario which is very west.. Every other set point entered on my GPS! worked fine.  The destination I was heading for however would consistently not offer a logical route and had me heading for the USA border.  This is Bizarre to say the least.  I did feel very strange and disturbed that night and am now connecting the GPS misfiring with the UFO incident.  SInce I telepathically transmitted to them, they may have communicated the final word on their evolutionary capabilities by screwing around with my GPS like child&#39;s play. I always wanted to see a UFO this close up..  It has been a preoccupation steeped in excitement.  Well, I now feel very uneasy and apprehensive about ufo&#39;s and don&#39;t want another encounter after this one. All I know is that they are here. Period.<n>

I was sitting in a swing that is tied to a tree in the front of my house smoking a cigarette.  When out of the corner of my eye I saw a large blue light.  Of course I turned my head quickly and saw a round blue orb going at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw that one for 15-20 seconds there was no sound at all.  I was still sitting in the swing at that time questioning myself on what I saw about 20 seconds later I got up and walked out to the street looking upward at the sky and another blue orb went flying by at a huge rate of speed it as well made no sound.  I only saw the second one for at most 20 seconds as well before it disappeared.  It was the wildest thing I’ve ever seen and I have also never seen anything go that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so enthralled with the 2 sightings I stayed up till 7 am just watching the sky not to see anything else.<n>

After an hour both objects moved slowly, then one object started to go in behind tall trees and lost visual contact.  The other object was moving upwards and east direction, at this point looked more white, but could still see faintly blue and red lights.  Once very high in the sky was moving in zig zag fashion then took off really fast,  about 10 times faster then a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were in a straight vertical line.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91385.html|104|ndxe201207| 3 orangish/reddish round “lights” flying north of us, above the beach.  They were in a straight vertical line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are a group of three women, all age 52.  We were on a “girls” week-end trip to the beach and had a campfire on the beach directly below our hotel.  At approximately 12:00am I noticed 3 orangish/reddish round “lights” flying north of us, above the beach.  What was remarkable was that they were in a straight vertical line, spaced precisely and equally from the other.  They were moving towards us, I thought they were helicopters and thought it was strange that they were flying so perfectly in line and with no sound.  They continued to come closer to us probably a mile out but hard to guess.   They never lost their perfect positioning and continued to get brighter,they seemed to hover a few minutes.   All three of us watched the lights and noticed more random lights to the right and lower of the 3, same size and color but flying in a random pattern.  There were several of these lights.  After a while, the 3 uniform lights started to get smaller until they dis! appeared.  At the time, we all thought it was strange but assumed a logical explanation must exist for the lights.  It was not until the next morning that we continued to talk about the lights and look up such sights on the internet, looking for an explanation, that we discovered that maybe this was a reportable incident.  After reading a news article in our local paper, Tri-Cities, Washington, the following week regarding a similar sighting that we decided we should indeed report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A brief background of the three sighters would be; one accountant, one nuclear medical technician, one business owner, we are mothers and wives.  None of us had  encountered any situation like this before and all three felt there must some reasonable explanation for this other than unidentified flying object, before this, skeptics for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/27/12 22:45|Wamego|KS|Formation|1 minute|Two Blue Lights Escorted by a Helicopter in Night Sky|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91676.html|109|ndxe201207| Two Blue Lights Escorted by a Helicopter in Night Sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I were visiting my sister and her family at their rural home several miles northeast of Wamego, Kansas.  At about 10:45 pm I opened the curtains of the living room in order to use the remote lock on our automobile’s ignition key to lock the vehicle as it sat in the driveway of the home. Momentarily after closing the curtains my 9 year old daughter asked me “Dad, what were those blue lights?”  Thinking that she had simply seen one or more of the yard lights near the storage barn(s) on the property I told her such.  She then replied “No, that’s not what I’m talking about.”  At this point we went back to the window, pulled back the curtains and, sure enough, there were two blue lights that appeared to be located above the barn / equipment shed located northeast of the home.  These lights were distinctly not the above-mentioned yard lights and, I would estimate, were located approximately one-quarter to one-third of a mile from the home and probably around 800 – 1000 feet in the air.  The location of the barn / equipment shed would be approximately 200 feet northeast of the home.  The lights appeared to be moving in a southerly direction that would cause them to pass to the east of the home. The color of the lights is best described simply as blue … no off colors such as sky blue, baby blue, etc. … just blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wanting to get a better look at the lights, my daughter and I immediately stepped out onto the porch of the home and watched two blue lights transit from north to south at a distance of about one quarter of a mile to the east of the home.  It was at this point that we noticed what was likely a helicopter accompanying / following the two blue lights.  The helicopter was distinct from the two blue lights that it was trailing in that we could observe at least two navigation lights (red and green), a flashing / strobe light (white) that would illuminate a portion of the aircraft / helicopter body, and we could easily recognize the characteristic engine and rotor noise of a helicopter.  In contrast to this, the two blue lights did not flicker or flash, were not accompanied by any other lights, did not change colors, did not illuminate any visible structure around them and did issue any noise … or at least any noise that was perceptible above the noise of the helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the group passed to the east of the home, it appeared that we could get a better estimate of the relative positions of the helicopter and the two blue lights as well as their speed(s).  Again, the group was still in the range of one-quarter to one-third of a mile in distance and probably 800 – 1000 feet above the ground.  Viewing the formation from an approximate right angle to the direction of flight, we observed the helicopter trailing or following the two blue lights.  All three were at the same altitude.  One of the blue lights led the formation, the second blue light trailed the first by approximately 500 - 750 feet, and the helicopter trailed the second blue light by another 500 - 750 feet.  All three were moving to the south at the same speed, which I would estimate as the normal speed of a helicopter … perhaps 120 to 150 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the helicopter and two blue lights transited behind the side of the house so that we could not see them, we went back into / through the home to the deck on the south side of the structure.  We then observed the helicopter and two lights continue their flight to the south with the same speed, height, direction, and formation described above until they passed from view behind the trees located a short distance (several hundred feet) to the south of the house.  The helicopter and lights were probably three-quarters of a mile distant when we last observed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were observing the formation from this vantage point, I consciously made an effort to try to discern or distinguish any noise emanating from the two lights as distinct from the noise of the helicopter.  The reason I tried to do this is that I realized that, given the radial separation of the helicopter and the two lights from this observation point, I should have been able to distinguish any noise from the lights as opposed to noise from the helicopter.  I could not do so and the only noise that I heard appeared to be coming from the helicopter alone.  Again, I would note that it simply may have been that any noise that might have been emitted from the two blue lights could not have been heard over the noise of the helicopter … but it was at this point that I should have had the best opportunity to hear any noise from the two blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire observation occurred over a period of approximately 45 seconds to one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In terms of atmospheric conditions, it was overcast at the time of observation with a relatively low ceiling that I would estimate at perhaps 4000 – 5000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although it is difficult to say for sure given that we observed this at night, I don’t believe that the two blue lights were part of the structure of the helicopter nor were they part of a single structure.  My impression is that each blue light was independent of each other and the helicopter.  Also, I wouldn’t characterize the flight formation as a helicopter chasing the two lights but rather it appeared as if the helicopter was escorting the two blue lights.  I also recognize the difficulty of accurately gauging distances / heights / speeds in a night sky but I do feel that the estimates that I cite above are fairly accurate given the close proximity of the observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guess is that there is a conventional explanation for what we observed.  Nonetheless, I find the number of unusual characteristics of our observation sufficient enough to make an effort to submit a detailed report to this database.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no doubt that I observed a helicopter.  But I am a bit puzzled as to the nature of the two blue lights that we observed in front of the helicopter.<n>

7/27/12 22:00|Tacoma (northeast area)|WA|Fireball|90 to 120 seconds|Red-orange slow moving fireball, inconsistent speed, moving north to south, dimming and finally going out.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91274.html|113|ndxe201207| Red-orange slow moving fireball, inconsistent speed, moving north to south, dimming and finally going out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife (educator), daughter (nine years old) and I (technical writer) arrived home at Dash Point, WA between 9:30 and 10:00pm on July 27th, 2012.  The sky was mostly dark already, with just a trace of dusk light near the horizon and the moon (a bit more than half) rising in the south over the top of Indian Hill in Northeast Tacoma.  No house or yard lights were on when we arrived home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got out of the car (all car lights off) I noticed a bright reddish-orange light off to the Northeast, moving roughly from North to South.  We see a lot of air traffic over Seatac from our home in Northeast Tacoma, but what caught my attention was the obvious fact that this was not an airplane.  The light was neither blinking nor steady, but looked most like the fireball flickering of shooting stars I’ve seen in the past.  But there were many aspects of this object that were unlike any shooting star I&#39;ve ever seen.  First, the speed at which the light moved across the sky was MUCH slower than any shooting star I’ve ever seen before.  The speed was also inconsistent.  At times it moved at about the speed of a distant/high aircraft, then it appeared to slow down, then to speed up again, all the while moving in the same direction.  As it moved southward, the brightness of the object was also variable, sometimes getting brighter, sometimes dimmer.  This variation in brightn! ess appeared to be a change in the object itself and not the effect of any clouds between us and the object. The color was also unusual, that being an intense reddish-orange. Most shooting stars I&#39;ve seen in the past were whitish, bluish or greenish in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, the object continued to move to the south, until after a minute or so, it gradually began to grow steadily dimmer and dimmer.  A few seconds after the dimming began, what had looked like a fireball took on the appearance of a bright ruby-red point of light, continuing to grow dimmer until it finally winked out completely, much as you might see when a glowing bit of firework cools and goes dark.  As the object grew dimmer, it also appeared to slow down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The motion of the object the entire time was roughly in a straight line from north to south.  While the speed and brightness of the object varied, the direction didn’t seem to change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen thousands of aircraft at night, I’ve seen dozens of shooting stars, I’ve seen a couple of comets, and I’ve seen reflected sunlight off the passing International Space Station and a couple of orbiting space shuttles.  This didn’t look quite like ANY of those.  In terms of the brightness and nature of the light, this looked most like a fireball shooting star, but most like a distant satellite in terms of its slow speed, except that the speed seemed to vary, sometimes nearly stopping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a theory, but that’s all it is.  It might have been a satellite falling out of orbit and breaking up.  This would seem to explain a) why it moved in a relatively straight line, b) why it moved slower than any shooting star I’d ever seen, and c) why it initially appeared as a fireball in the sky and not the steadier reflection of light off a coherent satellite or spacecraft, but then grew dimmer and dimmer and finally winking out.  But that’s just my best guess.  The whole thing took about 90 to 120 seconds from when we first noticed it the light to when the object went completely dark.<n>

E.D.S.T. seen from Naples  FL looking west southwest out over the Gulf of Mexico, we saw what appeared to be a large orange fireball at about 40 to  60 degrees elevation from horizon.  The sphere was about  one tenth the size of a full moon and was moving very slowly in an East Northeast direction.  It flared out (extinguished) at about 60 degrees where it appeared to have stopped moving forward, or toward us.  A smaller red light, but just as bright, seemed to be at the leading edge of the orange sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night’s sighting was the third that we have seen with this same description, with the previous two having come from the same direction  over the Gulf, but traveling much faster.  The last one was at the end of May  and burned out after going overhead and disappearing in the Northeast at about 25 degrees latitude.  The first one we saw would have been sometime last year.<n>
7/27/12 20:57|Hagerstown|IN|Teardrop|10 minutes|It was a slow-moving, cylindrical-shaped metallic object.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91234.html|118|ndxe201207| It was a slow-moving, cylindrical-shaped metallic object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday, July 27, 2012, at approximately 20:57 EDT (00:57 UTC), I noticed a bright cylindrical object in the southern sky, moving from east to west.  I at first thought it was a low-lying commercial aircraft, however it was moving very slowly and I did not see any structure resembling an airfoil.  I then thought perhaps it was a blimp.  I had access to a pair of 7x50 field glasses.  With magnification, I was not able to see any tail structure, propellers or gondola, therefore I ruled out the notion that it was an airship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was cylindrical in shape, with the forward end wider than the tail end, somewhat resembling an elongated tear drop.  It also somewhat resembled the shape of a helicopter, however I did not see anything resembling a main or tail rotor.  The object was metallic in color, and reflected the orange-pink hues of the setting sun.  It made no sound that I could hear and was not emitting any vapor trail.  I did not observe any type of navigational or warning lights on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By my best estimate, the object when I first observed it was 3 to 5 miles due south of Hagerstown, Indiana (Wayne County).  It appeared to be traveling parallel to Interstate 70.  I estimated its altitude to be between 2000 to 4000 feet, and I estimated its speed to be no more than 25 miles per hour (again supporting my thought that it was an airship).  It appeared to maintain a steady course and altitude.  When I first observed the object, it was at almost 90 degrees on the east-west horizontal plain.  I watched it until it was no longer visible due to tall trees and a near-by building.  My last sight of the object was at 21:07 EDT (01:07 UTC).  I did not see it actually disappear over horizon.  I would estimate its position to be at approximately 160 degrees on the east-west horizontal plain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an avid aviation enthusiast and student of military aviation, as well as a former student pilot.  I have a good familiarity of both civil and military aircraft.  I am 48 years old and have had a keen interest in UFOlogy since childhood.  I have no explanation of what the object was, therefore I felt compelled to report this sighting to NUFORC.<n>

It was about the size of a car and was hovering in a stationary position, not moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was seen just as the sun was going down over the horizon, so it was neither broad daylight nor complete darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiance and I seen the craft somewhere between the North Carolina and Tennessee border... it was in the Harmon Den Wildlife Management Area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling along 40 heading North/North West when we spotted it just above the interstate.<n>

One very, very bright white light shinning toward the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made NO sound, as it just hung in the air over the nearby Kankakee forest across the street from our home.  We watched the object move over a corn field down the street very slowly and seemed to be spinning the way the light constantly flashed in all directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time it was in the area several planes and jets went through the area moving quickly over head, and we realized that this was no plane or helicopter.  I have flown in choppers most of my life in the service and have never seen a chopper lit up like this object.  It slowly left the area at first and then just seem to gain elevation until it disappeared.<n>

We saw what looked like 2 or 3 orange lights in the distance.   At first we thought they were hot air ballon flares as they looked like small fires fading in and out of visibility.  After a few minutes they went away but then they came back.  There were again 2 or 3, but they had changed position and 2 of them were hovering in a straight line parallel to the ground. In the background it looked like a smaller light was flying around very quickly.  These lights faded out as well and again returned but much closer.  The colors were still orange but seemed to take on a little red Coloring as well. one of the lights &#34;split&#34; into 3 smaller lights and seemed to be in a kind of triangular disk shape, almost like the bottom of a craft.  These lights faded out soon after and then we went inside.  Our parents were out on the beach and saw the same lights we did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of us are very rational and level headed, but we all agreed no one knew what the lights were. It was very strange.<n>

My housemate knocked on my door and woke me up, claiming there were strange flashes of light in the sky.  We both went outside.  As soon as we were outside I observed repeatedly flashing bright white light in the night sky.  It looked almost like lightning, however there was no thunder and the light was continuously flashing and lighting up the whole sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 15 minutes of the repeatedly flashing light, a very large cloud quickly covered the entire sky in a matter of a few minutes.  Shortly after the cloud moved in a very large ball of light appeared behind the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it looked like the moon shining through a cloud.  I then noticed the moon was actually very far away from this strange light source.  The light source then began to move around.  It flashed a brilliant green light and then moved around again.  Then it flashed a bright orange light and began to move around again.  Suddenly there was a huge gust of wind and the object disappeared.<n>

First one appeared and seemed to move slowly emitting a reddish glow and floated upwards and disappeared.  A second light appeared in the same area and remained for about 5+mins before moving upwards, changing color to be more white than red and disappeared again.  We do have a photo however it doesn’t do justice to what we saw.<n>

It was hovering over the city near the hospital for some time (2-4 min) at what appeared to be a few hundred feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it was an antenna with lights on top of a building or maybe the Coast Guard helicopter.  That is until after a few minutes,  it darted down at an angle at a high rate of speed as if it had crashed or the antenna fell down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until I learn more I am thinking more on the lines of it being a radio control aircraft of some type with a nice light system.<n>

Using my cell phone I started to take several pictures to share them with friends and family.  I started taking the pictures facing the south and then kept moving until I was facing the east portion of the parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on, while I was showing these images to my friend, we noticed these lights that appeared to be in the clouds, several and on different exposures.  There is no airport adjacent to the area, neither any towers that would explain the normal existence for these lights.<n>

Very high altitude, and moving syncronistically together, exact same speed, exact same distance apart, until one disappeared behind the clouds, then the other. 3-5 minutes later, one returned and we watched for 1-2 minutes.  Heading towards LR on AR Hwy.5, we kept our eyes to the sky.  Between Pinecrest Cemetary and Alexander Rd, there was a 100-500 foot gap in the treeline, we looked towards Interstate 30, and there was a single light orb at lower altitude (less than 5000 ft). I tried to slow down, but the treeline was back so i hurried to Alexander Rd and the I-30 overpass, but when we got there, there was no sign of anything, anywhere.<n>

I really think they are real.  Picture 12 is the best one, if you zoom in you will see 2 lights each with a circle around it and what looks like 2 smaller lights on either side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can you let me know if you think they are real or not?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.

I could only see 3 of them but could see that they were shining all the way around what looked to be a round object.  I couldn&#39;t see what they were attached to but they were just sitting perfectly still in the sky.  It looked to be about 100-200 ft in above Silvia, Missouri, about a quarter of a mile east of hwy  67.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lit up the sky and town all the way around it.  I wasn&#39;t brave enough to stop, but in my mirrors I seen it rise above the trees and then the lights stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove back by after the sun came up and didn&#39;t  see any signs of anything, like radio towers, that high.<n>

I thought it was a star or planet because it was changing colors from white, red, and blue.  Then I noticed many smaller lights would flash around and farther away.  Then it would change direction and do figure 8 like pattern with many lights flashing around it.  I would also notice streaks of light that would fly close to the main light or just fly in any direction.  I saw one small but very bright white streak that was much closer and just over the tree tops.  I have been watching them dance around the sky since 0145 and it’s now 0345.

7/25/12 22:30|Marion|LA|Cigar|3 minutes|Several pulsating lights from a single craft flew at low altidude, traveling from the east horizon to west horizion at high velocity.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91187.html|143|ndxe201207| Several pulsating lights from a single craft flew at low altidude, traveling from the east horizon to west horizion at high velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This evening at approximately 10:30 P.M. central time, I walked out of my residence in northeastern Louisiana. The moon is very bright and intense, and the entire landscape is bathed with a silver aurora of moonlight. The night air is heavy and dense, but the cloudless night sky is similar to the clarity one experiences on a chilly winter night.  I glanced at the sky very briefly to study how the moon has dimmed the stars, making only the brightest ones clear. The radiance of the moon outshines the majority of the stars towards the west, but to the east, a large portion of the stars are left shinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is here in which my gaze was drawn. I was admiring the stars when I noticed two distinct and separate lights moving in the sky.  One was the typical sight of a commercial airliner flying at 30,000 ft.  These are easily distinguished because of their snail-like pace, and how they creep across the night sky, in a steady line, and never change course quickly.  This plane was moving towards the southwest, and was flying at a much higher altitude than the second object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object I thought as being very peculiar.  It seemed to be at a much, much lower altitude than the airliner, and was at approximately 2000-4000 feet in the sky, and emitted no sound, it featured red, white, and green lights, that functioned as follows: the outside lights were red, the middle lights were white, and the center light was green.  The lights pulsed from the outside toward the inside and were arranged in a horizontal fashion, and allowed for me to follow the craft’s trajectory, while the shape was more ambiguous, it could have been either cigar shaped, or disk-like.  It was flying in a southwest direction, coming from the northeast section of my property, traveling southward diagonally. It flew in a line that went from open air to behind the tree line.  It traveled much more quickly than I have ever seen a plane, and this is what sparked my curiosity.  After it disappeared I went inside and told my mother and brother to come quickly.  Thirty more seconds elapsed, and then the craft came from behind the tree line, changing from a southerly course and began traveling westward towards the moon.  This change of direction is what heightened my curiosity, because the craft seemed to be completing some type of circle.  The UFO went from the visible east skyline, to the visible west skyline traveling at an immense speed, and in under a minute it disappeared into the distance and out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am apprehensive to believe this is a craft from another world, because there is an Air Force base in Shreveport within 200 miles of my location.  But this was not a helicopter, commercial air-liner, or weather phenomenon.  I believe in the reality that other beings visit our planet, but there is the doubt that the craft I saw was a form of secret military testing.  I have not to date every seen anything in the sky that resembles this craft.  I am still somewhat shaken from this event, and the shear, silent eeriness that I experienced will not be soon forgotten.<n>

7/25/12 22:25|Cumberland|RI|Circle||Lights flying in the sky|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91153.html|145|ndxe201207| Lights flying in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 10:25 pm my cousin and I went outside for a cigarette. We live off a main road in Cumberland and we sat in our cars in our parking lot.  As my cousin was busy with her iPhone I happened just to look up at the sky.  There were several clear patches through the misty clouds (we had a thunder storm not too long ago) and I saw two tiny dots of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to say they were white/bluish in color but because it&#39;s a busy street with lights on it I am not 100% sure. also the lights never flashed/blink like a plane would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now there two lights, going over my head (southbound).  Both distance from each other. However the one further behind started bearing to the left (east bound). The first one still going over my head disappeared behind the clouds.  Since I lost sight of that one I looked for the second one, it went behind a tiny patch of cloud and stop in a clearing. It just stopped, as if hovering then dimmed out. I thought I was seeing things so I looked for the first one  but it was no longer in the path it was going.  The strange things is I looked at the north bound again where I original saw the lights before and there was one in the same spot, just hovering. I wanted to dismiss it as a star but it started moving in the same direction as the first one.  Then it started getting crazy and I saw several different ones at the time.  One would hide behind a cloud going one straight direction but then come out going a completely different way. If it was a plane it would made a wide turn, this seem to spin on a dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen strange things...but nothing like this.<n>

They appeared in the north sky and were four times the size of a helicopter light in the night sky.  They floated acrossed the sky like an air balloon for approximately 30 to 60 seconds and one by one fizzled out.  Then about 5 minutes later they appeared again near the same location and were more faint this time and last only 20 to 30 seconds and fizzled out again.

So it was no surprise that he would have questions about the lights in the sky that we witnessed together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I myself am a 47 year old male who has experienced some really odd and unexplainable stuff in my life after spending 21 years in the military and serving 13 years as a uniformed police office and 2 years under cover.  I’ve seen just about all the weird stuff, I want to in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 25, 2012, at approximately 21:00 hours, while fishing in a lake on our property, I observed a solid white light crossing the sky from southwest to northeast.  I pointed the light out to my son, who by far has better eye sight than I do.  The light was so far up that if you didn’t track it, you would lose sight of it.  The light appeared to be moving at a fairly rapid speed as that of a jet plane, but with no flashing lights, the altitude was much higher than what an aircraft could travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son &amp; I continued to observe three more lights over the next hour traveling in the same direction at the same speed, matching the same description as the one before it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it’s a UFO, interesting, if it’s plane or satellite great, we are just looking for answer to what it is.  I have seen these same lights in the sky before, but in another location with my old son who was about 13 at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights are not something notice by walking out the door of your house and looking up in the night sky.  I’ve only noticed them when concentrating on the night sky in a very dark area without much interference light from surrounding homes.  I don’t think you would notice them unless you are looking for them.  We just want to know what they are, so when we see them again, we have an explanation.<n>

The moonlight wasn&#39;t seen in the sky that night and there had been some heat lightening on and off prior to the sighting, but no rain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, there were two large round dull-orange lights in the sky.  As if someone had turned on a flashlight, they just appeared, like that.  They were side by side and large, hanging in the sky, perfectly still/stationary.  They were not blinking, there were no other colors, there was no shape - just a round orb of dull-orange light.  They were shocking to see, they were absolutely too high to be from any ship out there and they were not any &#34;flares&#34; or any such thing.  They hung there, side by side - they looked like 2 moons, side by side.  They &#34;turned on&#34; suddenly, hung there perfectly still for about 10-15 seconds, and then, as if someone simply turned out a flashlight, they disappeared.  There were no shapes or any other lights whatsoever around these 2 dull-orange balls of light.  Then, after about about 10 minutes or so, a set of three of the same exact lights, not moving, simply appeared (again - as if someone behind the dark sky turned o! n a flashlight) - and they sat there - stationery, not glittering, just sitting there as if three moons, side by side were in the sky, then turned off - again, they lasted only about 15 seconds or so, then turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, after another 15 minutes or so passed, a set of two appeared again.  All three times these sets of lights (2, then 3, then 2) appeared in separate parts of the area we viewed - if they &amp;quot;moved&amp;quot; there and turned on, we coudln&#39;t see them move whatsoever - they simply &amp;quot;turned on&amp;quot; then &amp;quot;turned out&amp;quot;.  We sat and waited for several hours later - and didn&#39;t return - we then went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen other reports in Kure Beach (some couple saying they saw lights that resembled what I was talking about on 7/23) - but they were talking about movement and different shapes - that is not what we saw.  They were dull-orange orbs that appeared, and disappeared, 3 times within the space of 25-30 minutes time.  They did not &amp;quot;sparkle&amp;quot;, or blink or anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked a man fishing in the surf that night if he saw them (after the last set disappeared) and he said that yes, he&#39;d seen them, had no idea what they were, that &amp;quot;it&#39;s just weird&amp;quot;.  He then told me that he and another person witnessed them 2 weeks prior, in the same spot over the ocean.  He did not elaborate on what time that was (2 weeks prior) or how many sets, etc. - he didn&#39;t seem to want to talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of our family on the porch have been going to Kure Beach to vacation for 30 years - never, ever have we ever witnessed anything like this over the night ocean sky - and it was no ship nor any ship signal, it was not a  &#34;craft&#34; that we could say, it was simply lights like described, and they didn&#39;t &#34;move.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other reports I read over the island (Pleasure Island) over the past several years don&#39;t exactly describe them as we saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are in awe - and are looking for some sort of logical explanation other than &amp;quot;military&amp;quot; or &#34;alien craft.&#34;  We are logical people and feel there must be a natural phenomenom due to a storm or something else - but what we witnessed, as we did, could clearly, if there were alien craft - be exactly that - much to our discomfort.<n>
7/25/12 21:30|Washington|DC|Changing|10-15 minutes|3 objects in 15 minutes, 2 balls of light moving north to south and 1 shape changing white &quot;ball&quot; moving in same direction|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91507.html|152|ndxe201207| 3 objects in 15 minutes, 2 balls of light moving north to south and 1 shape changing white &amp;quot;ball&amp;quot; moving in same direction<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday 7/25/12 I was walking home from a friend’s house at about 9:30pm.  I was passing a school located at Rhode Island Ave. &amp; Q St. NW.  Coming from behind the school, I saw a bright light high up in the sky moving south to north.  At first it looked like an airplane because it was moving in a slow, slight line.  But the more I looked at it the less it looked like an airplane.  The light had an orange color to it and was getting brighter and then dimmer over and over again.  As it passed overhead, it started to dim and then finally disappeared altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right before the light disappeared, another light came from behind the same school.  This second light was completely identical to the first in its flight path, speed and quality of the color.  It also dimmed and then disappeared at the same place in the sky as the first one did.  It’s difficult to estimate how far each one traveled as I watched them.  But they were far up in the sky so they easily could have covered 1,000 feet of distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of these objects made any noise.  For a second I thought they might have been helicopters because I heard a helicopter motor just as the second one was disappearing.  But then I realized that they weren’t because the helicopter noise was coming from behind the school (the south – where the object had just come from).  In fact I briefly saw the lights of the helicopter come from behind the school to confirm what I was thinking.  It didn’t follow the flight path of the lights as far as I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to walk and got to my street within about 10 minutes.  As I was walking down my street, I looked back in the general area in the sky where I had seen the two lights.  To my surprise I saw a third object that was completely different than the first two.  While the first two objects were high up like an airplane, this object was lower, about the height of a low flying helicopter.  It was moving in a straight line from south to north.  It’s difficult to describe its appearance because it had no discernible features.  If you can imagine a large plastic grocery bag (about the size of an SUV) flying through the air and changing shape in the wind, that’s how it looked.  Unlike the first two objects, it didn’t have any kind of light to it.  It was a white object that was visible due to the ambient light of the city.  It made no noise even though it was not too far over the rooftops.  I watched it travel for about 500 feet until the trees of my neighborhood obscured my vi! ew.<n>

The fireball looking object stood out very well against the night sky.  While watching the object come toward us observing it facing west, we watched until object passed over the building.  We ran to the front door approx 25ft away, and tried to resume watching it move.  The object had literally disappeared from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two witnesses have lived near an airport for almost 30 years, each.  This is nothing we have ever seen before....<n> <n><n> <n><n> ..weird<n>

We were 12-13 miles south of Safford, Arizona.  We turned east onto Artesia Rd after traveling south on Hwy 191.   We were traveling east approximately 25-30 mph as Artesia is a dirt road.  There was a half moon with a few clouds in the west sky.  The south sky was clear.  The east sky had rainclouds with lightening, far away, like probably on the Arizona-New Mexico border.   I was looking at the south sky, my window was halfway rolled down.  I said to my child, &#34;That&#39;s a strange light,&#34; and rolled my window down all the way.  I saw what appeared was a fireball and my first thought was a meteor, but the object was not moving.  I noticed that although it reminded me of a fireball there were no &amp;quot;flames&amp;quot; coming out.  It was kind of low in the sky and seemed close,  and I bet that if it was closer it would have been a very large craft, or object.  I saw it for about 10 seconds and then it was gone! , in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then thought that a cloud was obscuring my view but I could see stars and there were no clouds in the south sky.  No sound , no vapor trail, no blinking lights, nothing coming out of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After being home for 15 minutes my husband and I went outside and started looking in all directions, about 9:20 p.m. (21:20).   I saw many commercial airplanes way,way up in the sky.  Then out of nowhere the object appeared in the east sky, farther away, and after about 3-4 seconds it was gone, in the blink of an eye.  My husband was looking south so he did not see it, and since my child was driving my child did not see it.  I know this area is a military MOA and have watched many war games, day and night.  I have seen many types of aircraft flying over, day and night.  I have also seen satellites moving across the sky, and I have seen flairs dropped.  The stars seemed brighter and twinkling more on this night compared to many other nights and the moon was ve! ry bright for being a half moon.<n>

I grabbed my phone and took a picture and video of it (which I will send by email).  Then, all of the sudden it disappeared with a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Total viewing was about 5 seconds before I lost it behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It caught my attention due to how reflective it was.  It looked like a very stiff, very reflective polished piece of sheet metal just sitting in the sky.  Kite or Wasp Drone esque in shape, a triangle with half a rectangle stuck to the end leaving a third of the ‘wing’ overhanging.  I did not see anything tethering it to the ground and there was a plane in the Rochester area heading south and looked like gaining altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A DHL van was about 4 car lengths in back of me, I did not see him looking in the same direction, so no confirmation there.  I pulled into the Walmart off exit 7 and scanned the sky for a few minutes.

It was compltely noiseless. It was lower, much smaller, and much faster than the aircraft that fly over daily for Bradley Airport. It was hard to track as it camoflouged itself so well, but it did not turn which helped me keep it in my sight for about 30 seconds.  Within 5 minutes there was a single military jet flying low in the same vicinity, another thing I have never seen in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I had to shake my head and look hard to realize that I saw birds flying overhead, and there was the plane, moving off to the east, but what was the object that just blew past all of that?  It was not a missile, or a jet, or any other known thing, there was no noise, just movement at a high rate of speed!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Called the National Center for UFO sighting and spoke to the director and thanked him for letting me tell him what I saw, and as cliché as I have heard others say before, I’m not crazy, and I SAW EXACTLY what I have stated!<n>

I thought maybe the marijuana and alcohol would have made me see it. but to my knowledge i was sober enough to tell that the object was very well in the sky and wasn&#39;t just a cloud.  I saw this event over by the coastal trail on the same side as the anchorage port.  So, not facing fire island but over on the right side.<n>
7/25/12 01:00|Leroy|MI|Oval|2 hours|I have photos and video of a two hour long encounter - one pic with at least 100 unknown objects that are flying|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91350.html|167|ndxe201207| I have photos and video of a two hour long encounter - one pic with at least 100 unknown objects that are flying<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a photographer. I wanted to take pictures of the beautiful Michigan night stars.  I went onto a dirt road in front of a cabin I had rented.  I took some pictures and then for some reason I felt compelled to take a photo of the sky that included a bunch of trees.  It was an overwhelming feeling.  I took the picture and did not notice anything out of the ordinary about the pic but did see that after I took the pic an object moved from the trees into the open sky.  I saw the object move approximately 100 yards behind another group of trees.  I moved my camera and tripod across the street and aimed at the object. It was moving in and out, or behind a group of trees but it was clearly moving. It appeared to be a horizontal cylinder that was showing red, blue and white colors. it went from rapid to slow and sometimes looked like it was making a &#34;Z&#34; pattern.  I then saw it shoot a white light to where it had been previously, the first place I saw it.  It seemed as if it were scanning the area for something. As it was scanning the first area the red/blue/white light continued to pulsate and the object continued to float behind/in the trees.  The light then came my direction.  I should mention that during this time I was capturing video and still images with my Nikon D90 digital camera.  I took out my Samsung Galaxy S III and started to shoot video with this as well.  The white light can be seen in the video. It was almost hypnotic and when you see the video it is as if it is pulsating or a modulated oscillation. When the light is directly on me it is clear in the video as it is difficult to see any details.  The light them moves away. In the video you can see two or three objects that move about that have blinking lights. One  seems to be shining a light directly below it to either pull up the object below or help guide it. The object on the far right - and this is purely speculation though I have watched this clip for 3 hours in a l! oop - *possibly* has a figure or several enter and then ascend! . One th is is clear - the ascension is absolute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of the videos (The Samsung phone) I did not think had anything at all but I did not delete them.  Two of the videos have odd noises.  The odder of the two show a very bright light that is neon yellow and long and something indescribable (like a very bright book or corner of a picture frame). It is only visible for a fraction of a second but it makes a branch snapping sound first, then the flash of the object passing incredibly fast, then an electronic blip type noise.  Almost like in the old days when an MP3 didn&#39;t have a proper codec and had a glitch type sound.  I expect that I will transfer the sound into soundforge to try to slow down to see what I can make of it, if anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most absolutely astonishing thing - and one that is absolutely beyond question, even from my most skeptical friends - is that the first picture that I took (the one I felt compelled to take) - when lightened and exposure corrected - shows easily 100+ objects above, in back and in front of the tree line. There are at least 5 different types of object.  One that seems to be about 100 yards wide that has a row of red and blue lights on its edge. There is one more that looks like this to the far right, in front of the trees, below the tree line. It was this object that I saw fly to the right and watched the most.  The other objects look to be miniature flying objects that have two &amp;quot;head lights&amp;quot; that are either both blue or both red. These are small, maybe the size of a car or smaller.  There are other that are teapot shaped. Most have lights apparent. There is one more that is either attached or directly under the &#34;mother ship&#34; that I call the topmost one th! at has the ring of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be happy to send the one I am describing directly above this sentence if you would like to have a look. The videos are very large but I can store on DropBox or a place of your choosing.<n>

It was like 20 times larger than the Concord that used to fly commercially in the U.S. (Maybe larger since I was looking from a distance.)  I was going east on the north side of 270 close to Worthington.  Then I saw this thing swoop across the sky like in 2 seconds and it was gone.  It was cloudy so the object was kind of blended in a haze but I did see 3 lights on the bottom of it.  It could not have been an airplane because it was too big and way too fast. I mean 2 seconds and it had flashed across the sky.It was going the same direction I was.  I know what I saw.  I have nothing to gain from this.  Just reporting what I saw.<n>

I knew it was not a plane because it had a constant amber colored glow to it that did not blink.  It was moving at a constant pace, not fast but not slow, it was sort of a curious type of movement.  It was shaped like an egg, and was very dark, as it was 11:40 p.m.  It gradually seemed to pick up speed and with the blink of an eye, the strange looking craft disappeared completely.  I looked hard to try to see if I could find it again, but there was nothing.  It was just very strange how it was so low in the sky and so visible, and then it suddenly dissapeared.  I know what I saw was a UFO.<n>

From where I was; right at the toll bridge (40° 36.1823 N  74° 03.3498 W) coming into Staten Island; I saw an object 30 degrees SSW.  It was glowing brighter and dimmer. Eventually it glowed so bright it resembled the shape of a roundish trangular shape.  I saw it move downward to my 25degree angle.  I saw it spin and move West and it glowed brighter as it moved.  Then it just disappeared.  And then I got home and I saw it again and this time I was out of the car and I heard an echoing of wind and the next thing I saw, the light disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew I couldn&#39;t have mistaken it for anything else. It was extremely cloudy I couldn&#39;t even see the stars!  Aircraft don&#39;t fly that low in the sky and their lights blink but this object didn&#39;t have blinking lights.  There wasn&#39;t any visible sight of the moon due to the clouds.  And even if there was the moon, the moon is never that low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 110% positive that it was an UFO.<n>
7/24/12 22:00|Ogden|UT|Light|one hour-ish|A strange, color-changing light, zigzag movements, ejecting three small lights, mimicking airplanes… ((NUFORC Note:  Star??

Soon we noticed a light that wasn&#39;t flying in any particular direction. It was zigzagging back and forth, and changing colors - red, blue, and white/yellow. I noticed when airplanes were near, it would change it&#39;s light patterns to mimic an airplane.  Eventually it ejected three small white glittery lights that fell slowly to the ground. A few minutes later and further in the distance another one did the same thing, but we didn&#39;t pay much attention to it after that.  When the original one began flying away toward the south, we decided to walk back to our cars so we could keep watching it.  It eventually flew out of view behind some mountains.  Almost to our cars, we turned around and saw a large bright light hovering in the air.  It was getting closer and closer until an airplane flew by. The bright light then switched into blinking airplane lights and began flying away in the same direction.  It even sounded like an airplane as it flew over us, but I could make out its faint disc-shaped body, and I am convinced it was not just a helicopter or an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always been a very skeptical, critical person.  There is a military base 20 miles-ish away, so it could have been some secret machinery. Who knows?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD))<n>

It was a little higher than the telephone poles and seemed as wide as the road.  I had seen a similar object several months ago, but this time it was closer to my house.  I quickly turned off my house lights and when I did that, the bright light gradually turned away from me as a searchlight might.  It began to slowly drift toward the northeast, all the while moving the white beam over the foothills.  I could easily see oak trees illuminated by this process.  Occasionally the beam was directed into the sky.  I could not discern the shape of the object (although in my first sighting I saw, dimly, a classic saucer shape).  There were some red lights on the object which in the first sighting were! clearly arranged in a circle near the top of the object.  This time I couldn’t see their position as clearly.  The craft eventually drifted around a distant hill and out of sight.<n>

I went back to continue to monter the CCTV camera for that part of the parking lot and the white lights/puple lights were still moving in and out and up and down out of the tree lines.

Exited vehicle and saw object travelling higher than conventional crafts in area, and moving faster. Noticed object covered distance much faster across sky than the civilian and military craft seen nightly in area.  Light came almost to where I was parked, then suddenly made hairpin U-turn back into the direction from which it came. Noticed object maintain same speed during turn and not any slow, laborious wider turns I&#39;ve seen displayed by military fighter jets at various times and areas in recent and distant past. I served four tours on aircraft carrier and witnessed numerous flight-ops both on land and at sea during normal operations and air shows, but never saw any conventional craft move along in this fashion and as easily and as fast as the lighted object last night. Also became aware that object displayed no blinking lights always displayed by other conventional craft. Sometimes cannot see blinking lights on our crafts until looking very attentively. I watched this thing carefully but saw none. Compared conventional crafts high in the sky with the object,and they moved quite slow in comparison. I realize UFOs can change directions without turning, perhaps like a zigzag fashion, however, the one I saw appeared to make sharp, quick turn; like a U-turn. The sky was clear and starry. The weather a bit cool. Last lighted UFO I saw was on warm Labor Day in 1995 at about twilight travelling North to South over Santee, CA just south of Lakeside.

It appeared to be approaching the horizon and moving to the north very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about five minutes of watching it disappeared behind the New York skyline.  It appeared to large and too slow to be an airplane, blimp, or weather balloon.  It appeared very bright because it was raining and overcast and yet the object was visible what must have been four or five miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If other people noticed this and report it, please let me know what it was.

7/23/12 22:02|Overland Park|KS|Fireball||Flying orange lights in no formation|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91140.html|188|ndxe201207| Flying orange lights in no formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> At exactly 10:02 on July 23, 2012 my husband and I were driving  east on I-435 in Overland Park, KS when we both saw 6 or 7 flying orange lights in the sky...they were coming from the south, then lowered in elivation and headed west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were not in any type of formation, these &#34;lights&#34; all differed.  Some sped up faster than others, some were lower and higher up, and they would fly closer and farther apart.  I even got a video of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In NO way could this be some kind of plane or weather ballon or any kind of US aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This HAD to be an UFO.<n>
7/23/12 22:00|Duck|NC|Light|5-7 minutes|Two distinct red lights observed NNE of Duck within 3 - 4 minutes of one another with dramatic speed and direction changes.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91344.html|189|ndxe201207| Two distinct red lights observed NNE of Duck within 3 - 4 minutes of one another with dramatic speed and direction changes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observations were made on a clear night on a deck on top of a house approximately 2 miles north of the Town of Duck, NC.  Observers were stargazing given the clear night, and all happened to be looking the same general direction as one was pointing out Polaris, the North Star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two distinct objects were observed within 10 minutes of one another.  Both appeared in the same approximate area of the sky, NNE of Duck, NC, approximately 60 degrees above the horizon.  Both appeared as distinct, continuous red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First moved slowly from east to west below Polaris, slowed down to a hover and held for 30 – 45 seconds.  Two observers reported the object simply blinked off while the other two reported the object suddenly flew straight up and disappeared.  (I was in the latter group and cannot comment on the direction, it simply seemed to blink off to me.)  Several minutes later, a bright red light appeared moving directly towards us as it got noticeably brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, the light was distinct, very noticeable, and unwavering.  It appeared to approach for several minutes getting continuously brighter.  The object then suddenly changed direction and moved at a very high rate of speed immediately off to the east and appeared to travel from approximately 340 degrees (slightly west of direct north of us) to 40 degrees within a second before disappearing in a blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Military aircraft are common in the area and have been observed both during the day and night.  All observers were very familiar with the movement and light patterns exhibited by military aircraft – these objects moved in both speed and change of direction uncharacteristic of any aircraft known to the observers.<n>
7/23/12 21:47|Berthoud area|CO|Unknown|4-5 minutes|Two stationary lights, one orange and one blue, were seen emitting an orangish beam connecting them.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91165.html|190|ndxe201207| Two stationary lights, one orange and one blue, were seen emitting an orangish beam connecting them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving North on Highway 287 approaching the Berthoud exit, my wife and I saw two, stationary lights in the sky in the direction of Berthoud, Co.  Due to the darkness, we had no reference for distance or size of the two objects.  Because of this we can only say that they were in a line from our moving vehicle as we moved from south of the bridge before the Berthoud Exit to the Bridge, it&#39;self.  I would guess that the objects were well East of Berthoud as their position in the sky did not change much as we travelled approximately 1 mile before pulling over to observe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One object was blue, the second was orange and from our perspective were approximately 3 finger&#39;s-widths apart.  When we first noticed them, both appeared to be stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While watching them, and driving North, I had to split my attention between the road and the objects.  I saw the lights first but didn&#39;t say anything to my wife as they didn&#39;t necessarily seem odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, sometime between when I looked at the road and back, again, a beam of orange-gold light appeared between the two lights, connecting them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately, I pointed this out to my wife and we pulled over and stopped less than 200 feet before the bridge before the Berthoud exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I did not see the initiation of the light beam, I cannot tell from which light it originated and, presumably, would not be able to do so if it was, in fact, a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, it appeared that there was some &amp;quot;dripping&amp;quot; of orangish beam where it was close to the orange light.  I would describe this phenomena as being similar to a high-pressure hose spraying a stream of water.  As it gets farther away from the nozzle, the stream widens and gravity overcomes the water pressure, causing some of the water to fall away from the stream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In this case, the &#34;falling&#34; portion of the orange beam did not seem to make it to the ground.  Rather, it faded out the farther away from the beam it got.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the orange light (not the beam) seemed to grow noticeably brighter as the beam continued.   We continued watching for maybe 2-3 minutes and tried to take a photo with our camera-phones, but couldn&#39;t get a decent image (low-quality phones. . .we didn&#39;t get them to take pictures).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the 2-3 minutes, the beam disappeared. Upon termination of the beam, the orange light seemed to dim.  It&#39;s just a guess, but I felt that the orange light was a bit brighter after the beam turned off than it was before the beam started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to watch, both lights seemed to &amp;quot;retreat&#39; into themselves, getting smaller and disappearing.  This took less than approximately 5-7 seconds.  Again, from a personal perspective, neither light seemed to move, just wink out.  I say this because neither light seemed to get dimmer, just smaller and smaller until they disappeared.  I would presume that any light would get smaller and dim if it were moving directly away from us.<n>

It brightened and dimmed at about a 0.5hz rate, but staying white at all times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I thought it might just be a grocery bag that caught a thermal updraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved toward zenith very slowly until becoming stationary at about 60 degrees above the western horizon.  The intensity became constant for about 30 seconds, after which it disappeared entirely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately afterwards, a Grand Canyon tour helicopter flew past the courthouse at about 200 foot altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds after the helicopter passed by, the object reappeared, exhibiting its highest observed brightness, being roughly equivalent to Venus in intensity (when observed at dusk) and just large enough to clearly make out its sharply defined spherical shape with the naked eye.  It remained motionless and consistently bright for about two minutes before winking out entirely.<n>

We are up on a hill so we can see for miles. Suddenely just above the horizon we see a orange/red orb but not in a complete circle. My son thought it was an asteroid but it just stayed there changing from light color to bright colors and then fizzeled out. It was like a firework where it starts off not very clear and then it became very clear and then it slowing dissapeared.  This took about 3 minutes so we knew it was not a firework.  The next day around 10:00 a.m. I see what I believe to be a  military helicopter circleing around the area we seen the light. This was way off in the west so I could not make out the helicopter but it sounded like a military one with the heavy blade sound. We do not have military in our area.  So for now I&#39;ll just keep checking the net to see if anyone else saw what we say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The second craft glided NNW, then ultimatedly disappeared into the western skies.  As seemless and smooth as the flight pattern was, the second one did appear to struggle to level the craft momentarily.

7/23/12 09:02|Vienna (Austria)||Unknown|8-10 minutes|Strongly reflecting object, during daylight, slowly moving, high, and abruptly changing direction at one point.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91313.html|198|ndxe201207| Strongly reflecting object, during daylight, slowly moving, high, and abruptly changing direction at one point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is video was shot in Vienna, 23 of July 2012.  What’s your opinion….<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdQVIGdLxqw&amp;feature=player_embedded<n> <n><n> <n><n> Monday morning, in bright daylight, 9.00 am, 23 July 2012, this object was filmed above the City Center of Vienna.  The quality of my mobile phone (Samsung Galaxy SIII) was not appropriate enough to zoom further in, but with the eye it could be seen as a rotating and at some points very very bright object (i guess due to strong reflection of sunlight). I had the impression it was chrome like metallic, but this could be too much judgement here. It was not emitting light, it seemed to be reflecting it. It seemed to have a high altitude. Rotating across several axis.  Nothing below a a couple of hundred meters. More in the region of low flying passenger planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved relatively slowly (south-east), at the start of the observation, then at 01.01 minutes (of the video) it shifts its direction rapidly (!!!!!) and then continued flying at this point in a rather more constant speed in a straight line south. You can nicely see it compared to the balcony of the building in the video. The more i watch that move to the side on video, the more it freaks me out. I could see it with my eye, the move was very sudden and swift, and rather not common to what i would expect from an object I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it with my eye walking down the street in southern direction. I could follow it for at least 5 more minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not hear any sound.  It was very surely no plane.  No helicopter noise. It was not a balloon or kite. It was rotating, around several axis.  If it was a satellite crashing, it would not have made a turn at 1.01 minutes of the video and gone south-west... satellites crash rather with speeds in the range of several thousand km.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was...i am not sure...but it had me at &#34;owkayyy&#34;. What was striking me the most, it was very very bright at points, so it must have a strong reflecting side and the rest must be also reflecting but not as strong, as it was always was visible but at some points very very much. I could see people on the street looking at it too and seeing it... You can actually see right at the start of the video, that when the camera is not in focus, that the object was pretty bright, when i started filming. It was really a bright blue sky with a lot of sun, and the object was extremely bright at some points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe this footage can be used to be analyzed some more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In making the video thermal colors (youtube function), you can see a plane crossing right at the start of the video, and  I just saw another (maybe 2) object(s) when the camera goes down to show the pedestrians, above the houses in the distance next to the pole.<n>

PD))|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91147.html|200|ndxe201207| Three orbs flashing red and green over the Mission Mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving south on Hwy 93 and entering the outskirts of Ronan, Montana, at approximately 4:15am on July 23, 2012, I noticed a large bright orb in the eastern sky.  After stopping and taking a closer look I noticed that the light was not moving, but hovering over the ridgeline of the Mission Mountain range.  The air was calm and quiet and I could not hear any noise coming from the orb.  Looking carefully I could make out red lights, but from far away, the bright light overpowered and masked the red lights.  After viewing this object for about 5-10 minutes, an air-raid siren sounded in the town of Ronan.  I noticed all types of emergency and police vehicles driving in various directions in the town.  I then got into my vehicle to see if I could find out more information about the siren.  I stopped by the nearest gas station and asked the attendant if he had any information in regards to the air-raid siren, or the strange orb I had seen in the sky.  He said no, but guessed that maybe a fire had started in the area, and that was why the siren was sounded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, I got back into my car and continued to head south on Hwy 93, and at this time I could now see three orbs in the sky at various heights.  I stopped and got out my cell phone to take footage of the orbs.   Zooming in on the original orb that I had spotted, I could see that it was spherical in shape and it was flashing red and green lights from the outside of the orb and also from underneath the orb shape.  At that point I hit record on my camera, but at that same moment, the original orb I had seen was now gone.  It just vanished.  The other two orbs I continued to record, while still trying to locate the original orb that I had spotted first.  The two orbs continued to hover in the sky at different altitudes flashing red and green lights without making any noise from what I could detect.  After watching again for a while, I returned to my vehicle and drove a little furthe! r south down the highway.  At this time, the orbs also moved s! lowly south along the ridgeline maintaining their altitude.  I then pulled over and stopped and continue to observe.  At that time the orb shapes also stopped and again began to hover at the same altitude that they maintained which was around 10,000-20,000 feet.  I continued to watch the orbs as they hovered over the mountains and the valley floor below when sometime between 6:30 and 7 (I can’t be sure on this time) an airplane flew due east directly towards the orb shapes, but at a much lower elevation.  The plane appeared to be a bomber and kept its coarse east over the mountain range until I could no longer see it.  Within another 15 minutes of the plane passing the orbs literally faded away.<n>

We heard the distinct sound of a large military helicopter to the east of us and casually discussed the fact that it was strange that it was doing what looked to be training manuvers at 4:00 in the morning.  We live over the flight path to the airport and see them many times a day.  I was raised by a dad in the Air Force and was in myself so I am fascinated with aircraft and enjoy watching them when they do training excercises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to watch as it came closer going from the east to the west and were also wondering why it was flying so low.  As it approached the corner of our yard the tree was moving back and forth violently from the down draft of the rotors.  That&#39;s when we noticed the street light reflecting off the bottom of a craft flying directly above the helicopter.  It was shaped like an arrowhead and completely blocked out the stars for about 2 city blocks.  The bottom of it looked like a snakes scales made of a metal we have never seen before. It had one red light at the front and was completely silent.  Once out from under the light it was invisible again except for blocking out the stars and they just slowly continued west until out of sight.  We then realized it was not 2 helicopters doing training it was the one helicopter moving to get below the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date to July 23, 2012, during telephone conversation with NUFORC.

The height or level of flight appears to be well over what commercial and fighter planes fly.  My guess is whenever I see them they are well into 100,000 plus feet into what I would consider outer space, the level of the stars!   My first sighting was in P.R. while on vacation ( spinning wheel like fire approached where I was staying and then made a fast 90 degree turn and thrusted away extremely fast) that was Nov. 2011.  Between late June 2012 through 7-24-12 I have seen many things in the sky on a nightly basis which I firmly believe with witnesses to be UFO&#39;s meaning objects that I cannot identify.  I have over 8 other eywitnesses who have seen them with me and without me being present. What I seen between 7-4 through 7-24-12 are starlike objects, silent while traveling and at times pulse activity with the object. On 7-24-12 after leaving a store I pointed! out to my friend in Springfield, Ma North of an area near a town called Ludlow, Ma, a long shaped cigar shape with lights all across.  The object floated silently, dropped and then disappeared.   That same evening which was 12:30 a.m. I drove home quickly in an attempt to find the object but it was gone. Then I decided to star gaze as I been doing for the past month.  I invited another friend over my home who had a close encounter on 7-4-12 of orange spheres with over 15 people as witneses.  He now is more interested in the night sky since his experience.   He seen a bright starlike light with me that hovered for over two hours changing colors from white, green, blue, orange. It then switched positions to another location in the sky.  During my observing the bright starlike object changing color I seen high in the sky a light coasting across the night sky extremely high with pulsing light.  A second one appeared doing the samething heading east as the other was heading west.  This h! as been a regular occurance EVERY NIGHT there is a clear sky.

We first believed it was lighting but with the absence of clouds, noise and it appearing in different colors we began getting concerned.  It continued for another 20 min showing in different brightness levels and colors. We tried to show a parent but it wouldn’t show.  It stopped for about five minutes and began once we tried to show another parent who witnessed it.  We did some research and found similar sightings near the area over the years.<n>

Suddenly, looking south to the house across the street I saw a bright orange light. It moved off to the east, seemed to go higher and then disappeared.  As it went to the east towards Baltimore there was suddenly another one approaching us from the south. It also went east and went higher and then disappeared from sight.  I spoke to my husband right away and we both went out to the front yard and stood there entranced.  We could not understand what these were as they were very silent. There was no aircraft noise at all.  The amazing thing was the objects kept coming from the south going east for about 10 minutes in time.  I did not count but I would estimate that there were at least 10 perhaps 12 in all. Midway through the sighting there was a formation of 3 bright orange lights together that seemed to make a triangle shape. After this there were single objects ! again. They moved very deliberately, not very fast, but steadily. As they turned east they seemed to rise and they seemed to be going faster and then they disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At  one point I mentioned my son’s telescope to my husband. There was not tine to get it and set it up so my husband went inside for our binoculars. At that point there was one more orange light coming over the trees. As it turned east I trained the binoculars on it. I could make out what appeared to be a large disc shaped object that had row upon row of lights on it. It was in a vertical position like a satellite dish. I felt the lights were all separate as there seemed to be areas of black between the lights. It was rather hard to be sure of this but it is the impression I got when using the binoculars. This turned out to be the last object we saw.<n>

It approached me at an altitude approximately the same as that of small aircraft, which were flying at the same time.  Its size was about twice that of a small airplane’s red light.  The Torrance airport is 2 miles north, (plus LAX is 15 miles north) and there are frequent landings/takeoffs, so I thought that it might just be another airplane.  Airplanes usually have white lights in addition to red ones, so I remarked that this object only had a red light.  I did not hear any unusual noises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was too bright to be a star or Mars.  It was dusk and there were no stars in the sky yet.  The light did not flash off and on.  It oscillated slightly in brightness in a pulsating fashion.  It did not twinkle like a star.  The light glowed and had a very faint circular haze around it.  It approached my position and flew roughly from east to west slowly, at about the same speed as small aircraft.  This object’s trajectory indicates that it was not a flare.  I saw it fly for about 3-4 minutes and then it stopped.  It remained stationary for about 30 seconds then the light slowly faded out and disappeared.  I did not see a structure in addition to the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most unusual part of my observation was the sudden fading out of the light.  If the light did not fade out I would have dismissed the light as an airplane.   I did not see any other observers near me.  This was the second UFO I have witnessed, both in the Los Angeles area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it stopped on a dime, hovered in place with the first two white lights I saw facing me again before it rotates downwards and head dives to the ground, below the houses!

7/22/12 04:00|Ardmore|OK|Unknown|1 hour 30 minutes|My husband and I went outside at 4am last night to look at this strange star my husband told me he saw the other night. The star wasn't|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91089.html|214|ndxe201207| My husband and I went outside at 4am last night to look at this strange star my husband told me he saw the other night. The star wasn&#39;t out there earlier on in the night, but he told me it would pop up around 4am. I went out with him, and sure enough it was there. It was very bright and low in the sky...looks like a planet. I don&#39;t know if that part is relevant though to our sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked to the north because I saw a flashing light out of my peripheral.  I thought at first it was an airplane form the flashing lights.  I had my husband look, and we noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving. Then I noticed it had more than just blue, red, and white lights, some were green and orange.  It seemed that it was moving towards us after watching and then as it became closer, we noticed that it would move a little bit. It would dart from side to side randomly, in a really fast manner. I  looked back to the west where the star was, and saw another that had popped up.  This one looked like it was about the same distance away, but lower, so I think it was actually closer because my camera wouldn&#39;t pick up the first one and it would this one.  This is when I grabbed my laptop to take a video.  Then after videotaping them for about 12 minutes we went inside to grab our phone and take pictures on their as well, and my husband was looking for his looking glass.  I was also just freaked! out and starting to get really frightened and wanted to go inside.  When we came back out about 2-3 minutes later, a huge, bright, white star-like object had appeared south of the original star and just a bit to the left of it.  The 2nd UFO was flying to the right between both of the them, all of them making a triangle shape. The bright light really scared me because it was so low in the sky and looked so close. It wasn&#39;t blinking, but rather really bright and big and looked like a star. What was the scariest is that it hadn&#39;t been there before. We watched the two UFO&#39;s and the star-like object for another hour and a half. During this time another UFO popped up, coming from far away in the north(just right of the first UFO), looking like it was heading east towards the second UFO and surrounding star and star-like object. Then another popped up below the first sighted UFO, and it was coming from far away as well. It didn&#39;t look like it was heading anywhere to the right or le! ft, but just coming closer towards us. All in all, this experi! ence sca red me really bad. I&#39;ve never believed in stuff like this before, and I don&#39;t want to believe it. Maybe what I saw can be explained, but I don&#39;t know what to believe anymore. This was a wake up call to me I think. If you think about it, you hear this all the time, but you blow it off as a crazy person. It is reported all too often to their not be some truth to the matter, and that is what scares me the most.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also heard a strange noise in the middle of our sighting. It sounded kind of like a gun shot or a crash. Their were many trains going by while it happened and so i couldn&#39;t hear much ohther than that. I thought I heard an aircraft kind of noise, like a whooshing noise at one time,as well(around the time the star-like object appeared. I don&#39;t know if this is relevant, but thought I would add it just in case. Additionally, the objects were far away, maybe miles. The bright star looked very close though, and was very, very low towards the ground. Every once in a while it seemed like it would pulse. I don&#39;t know if that was just a trick of the eye though.<n>

PD))|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91144.html|216|ndxe201207| Four bright lights observed for 3 hours above Boulder/Lafayette, CO with repeated movements as if surveying the land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I were walking back from a friend’s house early Sunday morning around 3:00 am.  The night sky was very visible with only a few scattered clouds.  It was not until we were about two blocks from our apartment when I looked up at the Eastern horizon and notices a star that was extremely bright and much larger than any other star I had ever seen.  It was located beneath the stars, not in any constellation.  Its brightness was about 4 times a bright as all of the other stars as well as 4 times bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought we were witnessing a Super Nova of some kind but soon realized that that was not the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had stopped to watch and admire this possible Super Nova when all of a sudden the object (star) Shifted, moved to the left.  It was at this time that we realized this was NOT a super nova.  We continued to watch the object as we ran back the rest of the two blocks.  When we returned home we woke up the others in the house and all climbed up on the roof of our apartment to watch what was going on.  It was also then that we noticed the other three, slightly less bright, objects moving in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each of the four objects followed the same movement patters:<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object would be completely stationary for a few min. and then move slowly to the left or right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hover there for a few min. and the begin almost bouncing back and forth, Left and right, before it stopped and hovered stationary again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it completed both the movements described above, it would then begin to spin. You could tell this due to the way the light was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of these movements were repeated over and over in the same order for about 3 hours -	They did not stay in any specific formation, almost like they were individually surveying the land  The description of what the objects looked like: -	The brightness of each object was not the same; this was due to them being at different distances from my roof top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One would grow brighter as it moved towards my location, while others would get dimmer -	The objects would go from dim to very bright in only a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took photographs on my phone of the objects and when zoomed in, looks like they are simply white spherical Balls  I continued to watch this phenomenon for the entirety of its performance. After three hours of watching their actions the sun began to rise. As the sun began to peak over the horizon, the objects slowly began to move out of the atmosphere. However, two stayed behind for a very long time. I watched as one took about 15 min. to move up and up out of visible view. The last one followed shortly after the sun had completely come above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire three hours I was not sure whether to be terrified, amazed, or excited. I was trembling the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little background on myself:  Born and Raised in Kansas City, I moved out to Boulder only this past January after finishing by Business Management Degree at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland OH. I am of very sound mind and have steady employment here in Boulder, CO. I am positive that this was not a natural phenomenon.<n>

This was a sound i had NEVER heard before.  I walked out side and looked towards the military base.  there was a blue orb in the sky.  It was the most magnificent color blue i had ever seen, nothing i had ever seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as the color floated above the base and once again i heard the sound womb womb womb,  I could never forget it.  The sound still haunts me. the light just diapered out of the sky without a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked inside and asked the two people in my house if they heard the noise out side, they both had heard it. Tthe next night the same two were outside and saw &#34;something&#34; floating past our house, with military escort, soundless and lightless, flying lower than any plain or jet.  two days after the three of us were out side and saw strobe looking lights coming from the military base.   i have seen the same strobe lights from the base six time since. and since posting this same thing on a UFO sighting sight i have been harassed by constant phone calls from numbers that every time i call back it says its &#34;no longer in service.&#34;<n>

It continued to do these movements with no set pattern. after about an hour the object had very slowly drifted towards the north west. i observed 5 others that had similar lights and moving patterns through out the night in several different locations in the sky. the last one i observed was the exact same as the first (lights, location, movements) and that was at 5:35 am.  i was just outside of the door at the factory on the west side, where there were no lights, no other doors, and in front of me was a field about 60 yards long and then cochran rd (north to south) and then a corn field as far as the eye could see.<n>

After passing our location they vanished and could not be seen in the east.  The objects were sphere or orb-like and were in a pattern of symmetry.  The event lasted a couple of minutes as they continued to appear and then disappear.  There was no sound present for such an event.  We were in such amazement at what we were viewing that we never thought to grab our camera and capture the moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We didn&#39;t want to take our eyes off of the lights.

When I first saw them they seemed to be traveling in formation at a low altitude (lower or the same height as a small plane) then the formation dissipated and the lights scattered, traveling west.<n>

They were obviously not helicopters as they made no sound.  You could clearly make out the rounded shape of the craft on the bottom half.  They were in a straight line formation with the last 4 in a circular pattern.  I pulled over and observed them for about 5 minutes and then drove on.

I build custom cars and motorcycles for a living and work in a private shop on the outer northwest edge of Oklahoma city.  During these hot months I will work late at night and early mornings to beat the heat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, july 21, 2012, at approximatly 10:00 pm I was headed to work.  At about three miles out from the shop I noticed this mass of lights ahead to the west and northwest.  I was coming from the east and noticed more and more of the lights as i progressed toward the west.  I was on W. Memorial ave between N. Rockwell ave. and N. Council Rd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached Council road that is when i saw the most lights at one time. They were a glowing red/orange that did not flash but seemed to appear and disappear according to the angle you were veiwing them.  By then I had my phone out and was attempting to record these lights while trying to get safley off the road.  The large group of lights were in some type of triangular formation headed straight west, there were approximatly 15 to 20 lights in this formation and the angle of view would be 25 to 30 degrees.  As the large group went out of sight there were smaller groups, say 4 or 5 lights and i saw three of these smaller groups.  These are the ones I captured in the first video and were coming from the north headed south then turned to the west and followed the large group that was out of sight by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then proceeded to the shop, off of Memorial rd. and County line rd. where i shot the second video.  In this video i had turned out the outside lights around the shop hoping to have less light interferance. while filming this  video i was facing dihttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFJD6AUgp18rectly to the south . The lights that i captured here were headed straight west. My angle of sight was again 25 to 30 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions that night were clear skys. according to the National Weather Service out of Norman Oklahoma. At 10:00 pm the wind was @ 5 mph out of the east and the loft, which was checked at 6:00 pm was out of the northeast @ 15 mph at 3000 ft. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GVI1yTHUHU     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFJD6AUgp18 Here are the two videos i captured and posted on youtube.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best wishes<n>

They traveled mostly two by two, formation style, very uniformed in shape size and speed with no sound.   There was a cloud that they floated into and disappeared.  With a plane you would see it appear on the other side.   We did see a few flashes of lights, not sure what they were.  One of the witnesses was on his way to work as an air traffic controller.  He called it in and was advised there were no planes in that vicinity and so many of them.  Every witness had the same reaction, nothing they have ever seen and truly a UFO.<n>

I ran back to the house to call for my wife and kids to come out to see it.  It appeared from over a line of trees, moved silently and steadily, and continued for a couple of minutes in a straight line until it completely disappeared in the distance.  We weren&#39;t able to determine its size because there was no point of reference, but if you held a quarter up at arm&#39;s length it would have just covered it.   We then went back in the garage for a minute, but came back out and saw the same thing just hovering in the sky over the house this time, not moving at all for about 30 seconds.  Then this one moved off into the distance and disappeared like the first one.  We don&#39;t know if this one was the same object that we saw the first time and had returned, or if it was a separate one.  Strangest thing we&#39;ve ever seen, and have no idea what this could have been.<n>

Thinking they were stars or planes (the Syracuse airport and NY National Guard base is about 5 miles south) I went to the window and saw two large glowing orange/red orbs heading very slowly north.  After a minute or two they I noticed a very faint orb much higher than the other two.  The orbs then appeared to stop and rise slowly, fading out within the next couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Altitude was hard to judge but a guess would be about 2000-3000 feet with the third much higher. The objects made no noise detectible from our location.  They could have been chinese lanterns or similar however the timing of fading out and differing altitudes and brightness when they we no longer visible didnt seem random.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really dont know what they were but they were observed by my wife, 2 children (10 &amp; 8) and myself and I can saw were the strangest thing Ive seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

These were not in a regular pattern but were coming at different time intervals but fairly close together.

They were all coming from the west heading in a northeast direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four of us on the patio watched this until they were out of site.

If NUFORC wants I can provide the name of the marina and the GPS coordinates of my exact location where I was but I will not put it on the internet report because it may be considered personal info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 2 red flickering lights that at first appeared to be propeller driven plane tilting to it&#39;s right in order to go north. Both red lights which looked at first like they could be at the ends of of fixed wings rotated from being side by side 45 degrees counterclockwise from where I could see (I was facing east) till one was on top and the other light on bottom. Then both lights began moving to my right (south) the top one on a slightly upward angle and the bottom one on a slightly downward angle until both faded off making it appear as if the 2 objects were going southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this may not make the story seem encouraging or credible but although there were 80 to 100 people that saturday night at the picnic no one cared what was out there, they were much too occupied with the partying, the music, and so on.  Therefore me and my aunt are the only real witnesses at the marina.  The night sky conditions were almost 100% clear except for a very faded cloud directly above.  There was one clearly identifiable plane flying north in the opposite direction in between the objects,  The only possible rational explanation could be helicopters but they were both all flickering red, conventional aircraft will have clearly identifiable timed flashes of light with green on one side and red on the other.  Therefore if they were UFO&#39;s somebody else may very well have seen them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as they were gone I looked at the clock on my cell phone it was 9:13 P.M.  Duration of the entire sighting was 2½-3 minutes  I called the Sandy Hook, NJ U.S. Coast Guard, asking if anyone else called them reporting something in that area and time and they say said they couln&#39;t give out such information and forwarded me to their New York installation. USCG New York said they have no reports in that area and time.  There&#39;s no way it could have been celestial bodies.  Meteors or falling space junk would not move independantly like that.  There were other aircraft out there before during and after so chances are if they were UFO&#39;s there may be other witnesses.<n>

It looked like it shot up (or down) from the air force base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also saw a red shooting star right after it, more towards the East though.  Met 3 other witnesses, me and one witness shared a similar even that happened to both of us, we both dropped an electronic device in our pools earlier that day.

The light disappears like a minute later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not think much about it until we saw an actual airplane and then we knew that what we saw was not a plane.  The plane lights were smaller and blinking while the red light were bigger and motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after that we saw another three red lights forming a triangle and moving, but they disappeared again a minute later one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute or two of those lights disappearing we saw another two lights, all of them coming from the same part of the sky.  One of the lights did like the others and disappeared and the other one start to look like it was going down somewhere and we lost track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally a last red light appeared in the sky but it disappeared sooner that the others lasting less than 30 seconds. We did not saw any other red lights but planes that night and there were no clouds around during the sightings.<n>

Some clouds were moving in so I was looking up at the sky wondering if I should get out.  I saw a jet fly over and was watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden I saw a craft, large in size and not as far up as the jet cross over from one cloud cluster to another. I was shocked and said out loud, &#34;What the hell was that?&#34;  My wife asked what. I told her and said to watch the other side of the clouds for this weird looking aircraft.  It never came out. I can not imagine where it could have gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was very large and had a wide long fuselage with very large &#34;skids&#34; on both sides. I only say skids since I am familiar with hueys and cobras and the features protruded down off the craft in the same fashion as the skids did on choppers.  The craft looked like some type of short distance transport or landing vehicle.<n>

I think I know the difference, regardless there was something in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Circular in shape, Initially appearing to be a satellite located directly above the house across the street from mine until quickly it was noticeably traveling as well as hovering.  It descended from high in front of our eyes and we could see it actually hovering in a circular motion with what appeared to be beams of light shining from the object as well as a continuously flashing red light. As it got closer and also traveled in the sky (northbound at this point) after watching it for approx.30 mins as it traveled almost in a triangular-route... a glimpse of it almost made it appear to sparkle/shine as if it was possibly a star or comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However as it then continued to travel as well as stop to hover for several moments at a time we began to rule out possibilities.  A plane or helicopter were the first options to rule out obviously, but as we continued to watch this in awe- we considered every possibility including the sky lanterns that people have been known to illegally ignite despite the fact that we knew this object was CLEARLY way higher than any vehicle flown by a person let alone a simple sky lantern.  It continued to descend at a rapid pace and move northward in the sky until the street lights on the corner near where I live made it impossible to watch and it also was after 2 am at that point and I had been monitoring it steadily. My neighbors witnessed but we all are unsure what this object was. Needless to say I did not sleep and will be watching again tonite. I very much would like some answers towards if this was a flaming mass or a UFO although I feel I clearly know that any flaming mass could not travel in the manor of which this object did regardless of how I attempt to rationalize it. At one point I also noticed two lights when it appeared to be moving closer before it began to continue descending and moving northward.. (as it moved east aka towards my house/lake michigan) for the few moments that it did; I saw be! ams steadily moving coming from two lights as if the vehicle w! as movin g directly this way, however then the hovering continued on adn off and the red light began to appear/disappear as it hovered in a circular motion while also traveling in the sky.<n>

Noticed a little aircraft, high up, thought it was a private jet. Couldn&#39;t see wings but it was very high and  silvery, reflecting the sunlight like a little mirror, so it didn&#39;t seem unusual at the moment.  But within a few seconds I realized how fast it was going--way, way faster than any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.  My eyes fixed on it and I stopped walking. (I was on a sidewalk on a city street--Avenue du Parc--and I didn&#39;t want to walk into another pedestrian or a parking meter.) It was making a gentle arc, almost a straight line, across the sky, the way high-flying passenger planes do, but I realized it was not a normal plane or jet at all.  It was oblong, no wings, and it made no vapor trail and no noise.  (Too high up to be heard, maybe, like the highest passenger planes you can see.  But those always leave contrails, which is why you notice them in the first place.)   Then it dipped--it changed direction like no aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen before.  I&#39;ve been to air shows--I&#39;ve seen F-14&#39;s and all kinds of other military craft--and I tell you there&#39;s no aircraft I know of that can change direction so suddenly.  It almost stopped, dipped down, making a path like the letter &amp;quot;U,&amp;quot; and then sped off to the left, a completely different trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  I quickly looked around to see if anyone else noticed it--there were people sitting nearby at an outdoor cafe--but they were all talking to each other or reading, sipping their coffee.  The flying object would soon disappear behind the building across the street,  I thought, so I wasn&#39;t going to waste time telling some strangers to look at it. (It was so small and moving so fast, it seemed useless to do that.)   Then it flew into a wispy cloud, one of the few in the sky, and I lost sight of it completely.  I continued on my way and kept looking for it, but after passing through the cloud it must have been too far away to see with the naked eye.  As I said, it was going incredibly fast.<n>

Portland, Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10:30 PM, I was sitting on my SE Portland, Oregon patio deck and observed a couple of bright orange- yellowish lights hovering and moving slowly in the South Eastern sky (clear sky, no clouds)-- towards the direction of Mt Scott, Clackamas county. I looked through my binoculars and saw them. They didn&#39;t have any other flashing lights as planes do. Their brightness was about the same as a jet&#39;s flood light. They seemed to be in the same general vicinity, one of them I had in sight of my binoculars either faded down or disappeared. They were fairly slow, but about as high in altitude as a plane. I don&#39;t know how high they were, but they were about level with my neighbor&#39;s chimney, which, from where I sat on my deck would be about a 20-25% rise from atop my deck, which is 10 feet above ground level. I used my Suunto inclinometer for this 20-25 percent inclination estimate*. It would be hard to judge the actual distance the lights were from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 10 minutes of this, or about 10:40 PM I got a call from my father who lives only 800 feet (N/W) from my house. He said he saw about 8 reddish lights in the same south eastern sky, they seemed to be moving upwards, and hovering in place, staying close to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ultimately, I don&#39;t know if these are flares or Chinese lanterns, or what they were, but found them Odd. I only saw 2, but my father says he saw up to 8.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just felt it important to report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n>

This was unlike anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this happened, all of my electronics went haywire.  The batteries in my truck died and would not charge with a jump, my cell phone stopped working and will not turn on and it is fairly new, and my laptop computer will not turn on, nor will it hold a charge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot explain what flew over the front of my truck but whatever it was, has ended up costing me a lot of money to replace all of my electronics.<n>

This was something I have never seen before and could not identify, however, it looked very much like the description of an object reported to this site on June 9, 2012, which that reporter described as a bright rectangular orange light flying silently over Como Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking along the east side of Lake Como in the Como park neighborhood of St. Paul when I saw the object approaching in the sky from the south.  The object seemed to pass right over the lake south to north, not as high as an airplane would be (maybe a few hundred feet high?).  At first I thought it must be a helicopter approaching, but then I did not hear any sound (it was completely silent) and I could not discern the body or outlines of any physical object, just a patch of bright orange light with what looked like flames near the bottom.  When I saw the flames I thought that it must be a hot air balloon traveling at night.  However, as I watched it I realized that it was traveling much too fast to be a balloon. It was a still night (no breeze) and the light traveled across the sky and out of view over the trees in about 15-20 seconds.  The rectangular patch of light was a very bright orange and seemed to partly composed of yellow-orange flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It moved up and down, left and right.  It seemed to be slowly moving to the west yet it would have frequent movements to the east and would linger.  It seemed to stay in one &amp;quot;square&amp;quot; area of the sky for maybe 10-15 mins moving only every few mins.  Its movements weren&#39;t just straight up/down, left/right... at times it would move in a circle, going upwards to start the circle like a clock.  Other times the movements were jerky and it would just jerk quickly one way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also had lights.  You had to sit real still to see the lights, it appeared to be red and blue moving really fast so the colors blurred.  It appeared the lights were on the bottom but couldn&#39;t see it clearly enough.  As I stated before it appeared to just be a very large and bright star.  The colors only happened in beginning, a few occurances later but spaced out much longer apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone asked me how high it was.  I know that a plane came towards it and it lowered quite a bit and the plane went over it.  There were a lot of planes that night that headed that way.  Some flew near it, some changed their paths, not sure if it was coincedence or on purpose.  There was one really low plane that seemed big enough to be commercial but flying lower than I ever seen commercial fly unless you were by an airport.  At one time we heard a loud jet, significantly loud yet couldn&#39;t see it with the trees.  Never seen it near the thing we were looking at.  It seemed to be a busy night, a lot more planes than normal and odd flight patterns but that may just be a coincedence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted for sure 45 mins then when I came back out 1/2 hr later it was gone. I tried to record it on my Iphone and even took pictures but all that I got was darkness.  In one still shot where I&#39;m positive I was taking a pic of it, the pic has this swirly thing in it so I&#39;m assuming the pic took late while I was moving?  My Iphone camera messed up?  I would of seen swirly thing so I have no clue what happened there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the most interesting part was that it just seemed like a bright large star but it would just jut back and forth moving every few minutes that it was one of those things you just don&#39;t believe your eyes.  Then the colors would appear and your thinking to yourself this just can not be happening.  Logic takes over, and as an educated person I applied every probable cause I was taught in school to every creative idea I had and nothing made sense.  I live in town and because of all the trees the 45 mins I viewed it was when it was visible between 2 trees so after that it moved west and I&#39;m not sure if it left for good or just left my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really like to know what it was.  It moved in a circle at times for goodness sake... it was just so weird.<n>

The three light were angled at a 45 degree angle as well diagonally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We initially thought it was a crane or something, and were utterly confused as it was a rural area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer the light began to move horizontally.  We then watched the light from our front porch.  They were hovering over where a small mountain was (with nothing on top).  They would shoot back and forth across the sky and at one point one converged with another and then shot out so fast it made me jump back in reaction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were approx. 6 lights at the most, 3 more than what we originally saw.  If I remember right, after about an hour we had to go to bed so we never saw them disappear.

7/20/12 22:55|Long Beach|CA|Light|30 seconds|2 white star-like objects moving in tandem, synchronized turn, no plane lights|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91075.html|269|ndxe201207| 2 white star-like objects moving in tandem, synchronized turn, no plane lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once in a while I like to sit in the back yard and gaze at the stars.  Tonight was one such night.  To the south I saw what I thought might be the Pleiades, but after my son and I examined it through binoculars, we could see that it was a single star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Remembering that the Pleiades was higher in the sky, we walked around to the front of the house where we had a wider view of the sky, and as soon as I started searching for the star cluster, a bright white light suddenly appeared high in the southern sky.  My son saw it, too. It lasted for about a second or two, and got about as bright as Venus gets when it’s at its brightest before it faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly grabbed my binoculars which were hanging from my neck and focused on the area where we saw the bright light. My son was also searching the area.  Then both of us noticed that there were two star-like objects moving vertically in tandem, pretty much due north, about two thumb widths apart, arms fully extended (my son later told me).  They maintained precisely the same distance apart.  As I was tracking them with my binoculars, I was explaining to my son that they were probably satellites because the lights weren’t blinking and they were moving about the right speed for satellites, although I was thinking that they were moving a tad too fast to be satellites.  But that seemed like the most logical explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then he asked me why there would be two satellites, and while I was thinking of an explanation, the two objects suddenly banked about ten degrees to the east, still moving north.  They started the turn at precisely the same moment.  It wasn’t a sharp-cornered turn, but the radius was fairly tight.  What amazed me was how precisely they maintained their distance apart.  Then we both lost them around the constellation Cygnus.  My son later told me that the trailing object was the one that got bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One explanation is that they were military jets, and the bright light was one of the jets reflecting the sun which had set three hours earlier.  And I suppose that the pilots could have been able to maintain a precise distance apart.  What didn’t seem right, though, is that they didn’t have any blinking or colored lights. They were single white lights, like medium-faint stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m 55, amateur astronomer, been sky-gazing since I was a kid, and besides one strange object I witnessed from a plane a few years ago, which I reported here (it’s possible it may have been a Mylar balloon), I’ve always been able to explain everything I’ve seen.  Although the best explanation might be that they were military jets, the absence of blinking or colored lights or contrails (we couldn’t hear any engines, either, but they seemed to be way up there and we wouldn’t necessarily have heard them) seems to place that theory in question.  And I don’t have any other explanation.<n>

It first appeared stationary but moved away rapidly.  I was the first to notice the craft and photographed it. It is round at times but changes shape and colour.  It was low and passed beneath the moon.  I judge the distance to be between 7000 meters and 5000 meters above the earth. I made this estimation based on the distance between where I was and the Mossel Bay light house.  However I may be wrong.  There is nothing more that I can say about this craft and I don&#39;t believe that it is a UFO but some sort of man made craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

With unaided eye, they appeared as points of orange light, but with binoculars, it appeared to be like meteoroids, roughly round in shape, definitely appeared to be trailing fire from atmospheric friction, or propulsion of some sort.  Fireballs is the best word I can think of for them, but their speed was not right in the traditional sense of that word.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Relatively speaking they were traveling slightly higher velocity as an airliner coming in for approach, about 250 knots, but their altitude must have been near the edge of the earth&#39;s atmosphere, which I would then estimate as 6,000 - 8,000 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We may have missed some prior to going outside, but we stayed out for 2 hours afterwards and saw no more.  Please if you saw this phenomenon, post more details than I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am pressed for time right now with two kids biting at my heels.<n>

The Grosse Ile airport is within a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am on the forth floor facing South.  I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.  At first I thought it was an airplane on fire.  Then one of the same come out of what seemed to me to be the water.  One on top of the first one I saw and one on the bottom.  They hoovered for a minute.  Then they took off toward the west.  I could see the after smoke or whatever aircrafts leave.  They were totally silent.  Before the first three were totally out of sight and additional three came out.  Never in the same line but in patterns of three.  I looked through a star gazer and the things were blinking so fast and vibrating so fast, I couldn&#39;t focus.  I was transfixed.  There were a total of 30.  I posted on facebook.  Has anyone in the Wyandotte area seen anything strange in the sky.  No replies.  I could not have been the only one to witness this.  They were not chinese laterns either.  I know what I saw.  Within 15 minutes there were commercial size airplanes going over the are! a quite a few times.<n>

7/20/12 21:30|Robertsdale|AL|Light|15-20 seconds|Small point of light crossing the heavens changed speed twice and "wobbled" before finally vanishing.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91050.html|275|ndxe201207| Small point of light crossing the heavens changed speed twice and &amp;quot;wobbled&amp;quot; before finally vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shucking oysters in our garage with my nephew when I stepped outside onto the edge of the driveway to take care of some personal business…  While standing there I looked skyward at the stars directly overhead as we have had days and days of rain and the sight of stars was a welcome one. I noticed a very small point of light moving across the heavens and I initially figured it was an airliner.  After viewing it for a few moments I couldn’t spot any red, green, or other marker lights which would be visible from the ground of an airship passing six miles overhead… It was not a bright light, at all.  I continued to watch it and it suddenly slowed its speed to almost half of its previous speed then actually wobbled a bit to the side and then sped up continuing its previous heading.  At that point I yelled for my nephew to rush out and look at this strange light with me.  He immediately spotted it and then the object repeated the same motion of slowing down, jogging a bit off course then speeding back up to its previous speed. And then it vanished. It moved from directly overhead to the ENE.  Total sky travel was from directly overhead to a little less than 45 degrees from that first time I spotted it.  We remarked with a “What the hell was that?” then laughed about the notion of telling anyone about it…    Firstly, I do not drink alcohol since a heart attack earlier this year.  Secondly, I am a retired federal weatherman, namely a “meteorological technician” for 37 years. I spent my professional career staring into the sky at all hours and shifts judging weather phenomena to report in aviation weather observations and forecasts. I have never seen an object I would classify as a UFO, until now. And it’s not because I didn’t try! I have released many high-altitude radiosonde weather balloons with lighting attached and know well what that looks like. I have also seen the International Space Station pass overhead several times and even pointed it out to younger family members as a “Wowee!”  The object I am reporting looked like neither… I’ve seen “burn-ins” of manmade and extraterrestrial objects. This dim, fast-moving light was nothing like that, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had the object simply maintained its speed and heading, I wouldn’t have thought much of it. I still wouldn’t have know what it was… But, when it slowed down and momentarily wobbled and varied its trajectory, TWICE, then sped back up to the original pace it was then that my childlike curiosity took notice. And then it was gone. Had it disappeared behind a thin deck of cirrostratus I would accept that. But, the stars in the background were still visible…  I’ll just scratch my head over this one and wait for a logical answer if one is ever served. This was not a dramatic sighting, by any stretch, but something different than any other point of light I have ever observed in the heavens. If it was indeed manmade, it surely has some of the finest control surfaces ever built. And quiet, too!<n>

I&#39;m in Glendale, CA and it was flying South West of where the 5 and the 135 freeways meet.  Maybe 1,500 feet above the ground.  It looked like A vertical stick, red on the ends, metallic in the middle.  On the middle chrome part it had white and blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It floated in the air for a few mins, then slowly started to travel South West until it was out of sight.  I know it&#39;s too perfect, and creepy, but a black unmarked helicopter flew above us right after the sighting.  This was my first UFO sighting.<n>

Sorry it&#39;s taken so long to report but the more reports I read maybe what my adult son and I saw might be more worthy than I originally thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 20 at 7:pm dark with clear skies my son asked me to come outside. I&#39;m disabled so with much ado I went out and looked up where he was pointing. I saw it and turned to go back inside but then it occurred that I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before so I returned to get a second look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw were two stationary orange discs side by side. My son has much better vision than I said that on the outside edge of each were small red flames all around. We live in the country next to a lake (if that matters) and there was no noise emitting from either of them. It was hard to explain the distance only to say that the size of each was fairly equal to the size of the moon but it seemed they were no more than 5 miles at the maximum away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son said that he really didn&#39;t see them much longer than me but that they were in the same position than when I saw them. When I returned; it was just then that we got to see them leave our area. They moved on very slowly spinning at first in unision with each other then very quickly sped up but it seemed to me they disappeared before actually flying out of sight though they were heading in a southwestern direction when they left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always been a disbeliever in UFO&#39;S but this made me a believer!<n>

I was just east of Poplar Grove, Illinois.  I noticed a triangular shaped object below some clouds.  It was silver and very reflective like a mirror.  It was smooth and shaped like an arrow head.  As it moved very rapidly, it changed positions and the sun reflected off of it like a mirror.  It was flying north and then shifted quickly and flew east.  The end of it was blunt and was somewhat of a diamond shape.  It left no smoke trail or any other signs of propulsion.  As soon as it turned east, it flew away extremely fast and disappeared.  The sighting lasted about 20 seconds or less.<n>

All of us live in the area and have never seen objects like this.  We were in a drift boat on the KLAMATH RIVER.  The view of the sky was very large.  Objects were moving North and South.  They were white and long.  They were moving low and slow.  At least one disappeared behind mountains and reappeared.  They seemed to return or be replaced by other objects.  They were very bright white appearing to be reflecting sunlight not self luminous. There was no sound  We could hear.  There was background noise in the boat so there could have been noise.  Four or five cycles of objects were seen.  During one cycle a northbound object came close to a southbound object.  The southbound object had a contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No contrails were observed on the northbound objects.  A vague estimate of distance would be under 12 miles.  Later in the afternoon around 18:00 hours a southbound object was seen with a contrail.  The contrail disappeared.  A this point I was able to photograph with a digital camera with a 12 power telephoto lens.  It appears like a fuselage with a possible wing near the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not blown up the photo on computer yet. Sightings of black silhouetted birds were also seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In My opinion these objects could have been drones in test mode.  The did not execute any unusual behavior other than they were slow and low. They moved in straight lines The three observers are local and spend a lot of time outside.  Two were Indians. We all agreed these were unusual objects and We have never seen anything similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THANKS for Your interest<n>

We had just pulled out our parking space, my girlfriend drove and as she drove towards the main street we noticed an object brightly lit up rolling up the hillside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Excited, my girlfriend parked the car in order to take a picture, the object stopped right in front of us and hovered for approximately 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was shaped like a pyramid, but the top was flat...there were lights on all four corners. one white, one blue, one red and one amber.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had a large bubble in the center and the object seemed to roll around it...I also noticed what looked like air vents and a couple of access panels of sorts. The object was approximately 2 stories high and it were gold in color or so it seemed to take on the color of the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now we&#39;re both outside the car and she&#39;s trying to take the picture with her cell phone...the objected stopped directly behind some trees that had been trimmed recently and right next to a condo complex on Grand Ave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unable to get a clear picture my girlfriend and I thought the object attempted to avoid us taking a photo...just as she snapped the shutter the object proceeded to roll back down the hill towards Diamond Bar Blvd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in the car and made the right turn down Grand Ave to Diamond Bar Blvd, I kept my eye on the onject as it changed direction and rolled away behind the shopping center. i at first thought to follow and see if i could possibly get a better shot at an picture, but the object began to pull away at an rapid rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We told ourself not to say anything, but I cant seem to stop seeing in my dreams each night. Plus this isnt my first sighting, but lets let that go!!! I&#39;m a man of many skills...i could build my own aircraft and I know what a weather balloon looks like!!!

The night was clear, no moon, no clouds, just stars and a light that was too bright to be a star. It grew brighter, as if coming towards my brother and I. The object was moving. It disappeared after a while, but not completely. It was almost as if the UFO turned into a cloud. A cloud, which was glowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing said cloud for multiple minutes, the bright grew brighter, once again. There seemed to be a bright haze around the craft, making it difficult to describe exactly what it was my brother and I were looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the craft seemed to be shining a beam over the area, almost as if it was looking for something. It wasn&#39;t a helicopter, for there was no noise.  And I know of no crafts which are so bright that you can&#39;t pick out exactly what they are.  The light was so great that as the craft drew closer it was almost blinding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The same events repeated for a couple of hours.  I didn&#39;t stick around to find out what happened to the craft, so I can&#39;t say how it finally vanished. I, however, have never seen anything like it.  The craft was so bright, almost looked like a star which was too close.  However, stars don&#39;t move towards you, turn into clouds, vanish, come back and repeat.  By the time I was home, both my brother and I were shaking and couldn&#39;t wait to tell our mother what had taken place.<n>

(From my perspective it looked to be 10 plus feet in diameter comparing it to the distant tree tops)  The object was moving southeast above the mountain tops approximately 1 or more miles from us.  It descended dropping altitude to the north side of the mountain moving at a steady slow speed.  We observed the object for approximately 5 minutes, it looked as if it descended into the tree line, or the light went out.<n>

The same orbs were seen the night before and seemed to be moving back and forth through the sky.  Sort of like a liquid motion.  Helicopters were noticed on the first night and although it was dark sounded like they were flying over the orbs location.  This didn&#39;t seem to be the case on the 2nd night.

It came on again about 10 minutes later a little to the left(south) of where it was before.  Same shape, same intensity....   again about 4 - 5 seconds not moving at all. Big glowing object which was definitely not a plane.   We sat for hours waiting for it again without seeing it.   During this time we saw many planes,  they where nothing similar to what we saw.   A plane in the air is a point of light(s) and this was huge.   The was nothing underneath it that we could tell in the sound.   All 4 of us have never seen anything like it before.<n>

Within a couple seconds it went from about 1,000 feet up to what looks like about 4-5,000 feet up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walking through the French Quarter at about 6:30 am,  I looked up saw/ heard a passenger jet fly over. I recognized its shape and saw its blinking navigation lights immediately as i have seen many hundreds of air craft before it.  I&#39;ve always been able to identify every single craft i&#39;ve ever witnessed in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an air force brat, born and raised spent my life studying jets, planes and all things in the air. Plus &#39;always known about UFOs, seen pictures, heard stories been a fan of Science Fiction since i was old enough to read &amp; about the universe at large.  What happened yesterday morning was nothing like i&#39;ve ever seen or even thought i would ever see. It was like something out of Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind, accept real and in person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was confused at first because i didn&#39;t recognize the color of the bright lights, heard no sound and couldn&#39;t actually see the shape of the craft.  It&#39;s as tho the lights were deliberately being shined at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like very, very bright, orange headlights at first on a slow moving helicopter that hovered to a stop in the middle of my point of view. It was in the middle of the street about 1 mile away and about 500-1000 feet up.  It came to a stop when i stopped in the middle of the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at it and thought &amp;quot;what is that ?&amp;quot;  The shape of the air craft was obscured  due to the practically blinding brightness of the orange lights.  Now, It reminded me of the feeling of being under a spotlight.  The same light in your eyes a DJ person on stage might feel. It was briefly a blinding light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple seconds of trying to see the shape of the craft, it looked like it was fading and going up into the sky so i grabbed my camera took the photo and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was low enough to look like some kind of big hovering mass i couldn&#39;t even tell what shape it was due to the brightness of the light shining on me as tho i was under an extremely bright spotlight.  I grabbed the camera too the pic and it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry gentleman, something extraordinary and life changing has happened to me. Yesterday i experienced what i&#39;ve explained here.  Something wonderful, unexplainable and ... after some thought, something i was ready for.  I&#39;ve been preparing since i was old enough to read.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You see those three lights in the picture ? I&#39;ve just told you where they came from, what it looked like up close as they shined a laser or spotlight on me and that&#39;s what it looks like as it speeds away into the sky at about 10,000 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m an artist and musician who is creative in many ways, however i&#39;m not creative nor skilled enough to make this up.<n>

I was a junior in high school then but it was a weekend. I lived in Willow View Apartments in Staunton Va.  I had been hanging out around the apts with friends all day as usual and it was starting to get late...prob around midnight or so. Everyone decided to call it a night except for me and one of my friends so we walked up to my apt and sat on the steps talking and joking around. I was getting ready to call it a night myself when I happened to look out in the horizon and I saw it!  Staunton is a very hilly city and where I lived was on a hill so when looking at the horizon you can see very far and notice distinct land features(mountains,ECT...)  With one mountain really more of a really big hill to the SW of my porch that to me always looked to be out of place being an almost perfect pyramid with no other mountains close to it. Back to the story when I looked out there I noticed a very very bright light right above the peak of that oddly shaped mountain.  It looked the same as someone pointing a bright flashlight about 100 yards away from would look.  It did not move and did not make any noise that I could here.  After staring for a moment or two and letting it process in my brain I pointed it out to my friend.  We both agreed that it was way way to big and bright to be a star or planet and could tell it was far off but not very far probably within 10 to 50 miles. We watched it for what seemed like forever but was really about ten minutes and it didn&#39;t move or dim or even flicker the whole time.  Then out of nowhere as we both were watching as fast as you can blink it just simply disappeared like it was somebodies huge lightbulb and they hit the switch.  It never came back and have never seen it again.<n>

We looked at the object for a good 2 minutes.  The weird part is that we could see the blackish outline, it was a perfect triangle.  This is where it gets tricky. for some reason i instantly believed it was an airplane for absolutely no reason, the same happened to my father.  We left and instantly snapped out of the disbelief and realized we had seen something we shouldnt have, after this while we were driving away we looked back to see if it was still there but it was gone.  This encounter has been bothering me all day, so i decided to look up pictures and ended up here.  The craft seemed to have tricked us, which really bothers me.  Also, this object was moving very slowly, made no sound, and was very close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were sitting in a circle at the people facing the ocean saw several bright lights that came on suddenly, stayed on for 5-10 seconds and then faded.  Those of us with our backs to the ocean turned around and watched.  Over the next 30 minutes we saw them repeatedly. Sometimes there was just one and other times 2- 4 at a time.  One time three of them came on in a sequence moving left to right and then faded in the same pattern.  We probably saw 15-20 of them during that 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was reddish yellow and came on intensely, stayed on for several seconds and then faded. There were some low clouds on the horizon and one time one lit up behind the cloud and gave the impression that it was a VERY intense light. These were located due east of the beach at about 25 degrees off the horizon. It was hard to tell how far away they were but probably 5-10 miles would be my guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No aircraft were visible anywhere near the lights.  The nearest air bases are Shaw Air Force Base and Charleston Navel Air Station.  There was a southeasterly wind of about 15 mph. The lights did not appear to move in any direction while they were visible.<n>

I go outside at dusk every night to bring him inside.  Hes an old kitty so I usually hold him for a while and watch the sunset/rising stars before I go in for the night.  So tonight I looked up and about directly above me but a little lower in the sky, to the North, I saw a flickering yellow/golden orb.  It was moving in a sporadic, shifty manner towards the East.  Kind of flickering and bouncing as it went.  It seemed to have an aura to it that caused the flickering effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound and after about one to two minuets, it disappeared slowly, like a candle going out, into the eastern sky.  At arms length, it looked to be about the size of the tip of my thumb, a little smaller than a dime.  It dissipated silently into a pinpoint. Maybe it was a flare?  I just never saw a flare that went up into the eastern sky.  I&#39;m excited, this was my first UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n>

When next we saw it it would be in a different location in the sky.  Each time it would appear it would last a different amount of time.  Several times we saw 2 appear at the same time and then they broke up into smaller spheres in a sparkle pattern and moved across the sky.  We observed these objects for 2 different nights and 8-10 people saw them with us. They always appeared after dark over the ocean in a southern direction.  The first night we probably observed at least 30 times these spheres of amber light and sparkles.  My husband, who is an engineer, observed them with binoculars and stated they appeared to be a line of lights rather than a single orb.<n>

After reappearing, the flash would be in a slightly different location.  It did not move in any one direction.  After a longer pause of about five minutes, the flash or fireball object came again with the same general pattern.  Later we started to see small flashing lights that were white and looked like stars.  They seemed to stay in a group and moved across the sky at a faster rate than any plane could hope to go.  The smaller lights would follow each other around, often flashing more as the got closer together.  All of these events took place over the ocean and were seen from the beach.<n>
7/18/12 21:20|Shawano|WI|Fireball|4-5 minutes|Two huge bright pulsating lights traveling slowly at low altitude from East to West silently in a low ambiant noise area.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91076.html|320|ndxe201207| Two huge bright pulsating lights traveling slowly at low altitude from East to West silently in a low ambiant noise area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:20 PM Central Daylight Time July 18, 2012, I was sitting with my dogs in my driveway enjoying a fire I had built in a metal fire pit.  This location is about 300 feet from the north shore of Shawano Lake, WI, of which I have a basically an unrestricted due south view except for a few trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly to my left or east I saw what I initially considered to be a large fireworks rocket being launched from an area east of me.  I immediately noticed that it did not explode and the trajectory was not like a fireworks rocket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gaining my interest immediately, I advanced about 100 feet toward the lake to get a better view.  As I was advancing it appeared more to be a fireball with pulsating red, yellow and orange lights.  It was quite close relatively speaking and I quickly dismissed the fireball description and thought maybe it was a small plane on fire trying to make it to the local airport on the opposite side of the lake about 2 miles away.  The lighted object made no sound in a virtually silent area geographically and at this point, I realized that this was nothing I could logically identify and realized that this may in fact be a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a second one showed up on the same trajectory about 2 miles behind the first one.  I turned and ran to the front door of my house and yelled to my wife to hurry and come outside and look at these strange lights.  She had the presence of mind to grab a small Canon Power Shot SD 600 camera and began shooting video as we advanced toward the lake shore.  I/we observed these lights travel in a straight line a total distance of about 6 miles before entering some scattered clouds preceding some later light rain.  I could clearly see these clouds against the remaining glow of the sky from the twilight in the West.  The scattered clouds appeared to be about 4000 feet AGL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared as though these craft were traveling 150-200 MPH and clearly climbed into the clouds about 3-4 miles to the west of our position.  The scattered cloud cover was advancing from the Northwest and preceding a light rain which started about an hour later.  These low clouds were above the UFOs and the local surface wind and scattered clouds were blowing lightly from the Northwest.  The low cloud layer moved in the opposite relative direction of the movement of the UFOs.  The size of these craft from our vantage point appeared to be about the size of a quarter held at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our observation and video ended when they entered the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found him to be exceptionally eloquent and objective in describing the sighting that he and his wife had had.  We suspect that both witnesses are exceptionally capable.  PD))<n>
7/18/12 21:20|Port Orange|FL|Triangle|5 minutes|Orange/white glowing lights in night sky, triangle formation, moving from west to east July 18, 2012 - 9 PM|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91098.html|321|ndxe201207| Orange/white glowing lights in night sky, triangle formation, moving from west to east July 18, 2012 - 9 PM<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my evening bicycle ride heading south, I saw a bright orange glowing sphere emerge from above the tree tops.  As I watched it, two more followed forming a triangle shape.  Then, two more came after that.  They were all the same size, shape and color.  They did not flash like the lights of a plane would.  They did not make any noise and traveled at a steady pace from East to West over the river and out towards beachside and the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small airplane (4 seater maybe) followed after them in almost the same direction, which confirmed for me that they were not small airplanes flying together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment, someone a few blocks to the west lit off some fireworks.  Not sure why other than maybe they had some leftover from 4th of July, but it made me wonder if they had sent up some Chinese lanterns.  But, the lights I saw stayed in the exact same formation, did not gain altitude that I could tell, did not flicker or change in any way, and none scattered or floated in different directions.  I thought they’d have to be pretty talented or lucky to send up lanterns in a triangle shape and have them stay that way as they floated over the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regardless, after these lights had gone out of sight, I proceeded a little further with my bike ride but was a shaken by what I had seen.  I have never seen anything like this.  So, I decided to turn around and head home going north on the same road.  When I did, as I approached the same area, two more of the same lights emerged flying parallel to each other and also went from West to East over the river and out towards beach side and the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have three photos from my cell phone camera of the first set of f five as I was heading south and one picture of the two I saw when I was heading north.  The first two pictures have a street light in the photo and the distance from the street light changes, so you can tell that the lights have moved away from the street light.  In the first three, the color of the lights appears white, although they were orange to my naked eye.  The last picture of the final two I saw more accurately reflects the orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Flashing was not consistent and movement was erratic.  Individuals in the beach house next to us were watching the activity also.  A couple of the orbs seemed to change to red at various times.  We were located right on the beach and watched the activity for a solid 45 mins.  At a certain point at the end all orbs turned and seemed to fly off into the distance.<n>

We looked up and saw this big bright yellow/orange light. It flickered, intermittent.  Then a second light lite up bright yellow/orange.  Then they went dim had rapid flickering white lights.  They were moving way too fast for airplanes.  Lights became bright again and moved sideways, fast.  Wasn&#39;t sure what we were looking at.  Lights disappeared, so we went inside.   Moved to the back porch area to look for lights .  Saw lights again. When bright lights came, it appeared the object/the stopped.  Once it went dim, it moved.  Very irrational movement.  Movement didn&#39;t make sense, did not seem to follow a pattern.  Three lights total, traveling in not quite a triangle shape formation.  Not  sure about the distance from us.  Light when it illuminated was very bright and then dimmed as dull as a night star.  You could clearly see the light flashing as fast as strobe lights when dimmed.  I am a little freaked out by what we saw.  Totally unexplainable.  Now tonight has me really thinking.<n>

This occured about 5 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this a formation of about 5 lights then were moving slowly across the sky staying in formation.   After about 30 minutes they were gone.  There was no sound heard at all.<n>

They appeared at first as small twinkles in many spots, then flash white or orange light for approximately 5-10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time my wife, son and two other friends had joined us on the balcony, my friend also works for the airline and he had no explanation for the strange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for about an hour and a half.<n>

It was gone by the time he came out.  I wish I could have got the camera and made a picture but I didn’t have time.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> This story was told to me by my granddaughter’s 12 year old girl friend on the evening of July 19, 2012, around 9:00 P.M:<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;The three of us, me, my granddaughter, and her friend were outside sitting at a patio table watching the stars following my granddaughter’s birthday party.  All the other children were gone.  I was very much interested as my own grandmother told everyone in our family the story of she and her sister around  August of 1904 seeing an orange ball of light in an area a few miles distance from this sighting..&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> She and my granddaughter asked me if I knew what it was and I responded it was probably a meteorite to calm th! eir fears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Preceding this question my granddaughter said she was afraid of space things and her friend said she was a little afraid too.  I cannot give this child’s name and her custody situation makes it impossible for me to get permission to do so.  If you cannot publish this under the circumstances I understand.  In the light of the recent orange fireball phenomenon I decided to report it.  I do believe this girl’s story.   She had no reason to fabricate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

And it was way to fast for an air plain.  Then we got home went in and we herd the fighter jets circling around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And like 2 min after we went back out we saw the same exact thing again one orange light then it went away then another orange light a good distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And like I said before it was to fast to be an air plane.<n>

I guess I’ll give a little context to my story.  My parents, brother and sister-in-law took one of those cruises from Vancouver up the Pacific coast and I flew in from Houston to meet up with them in Anchorage for some sightseeing and fishing.  We spent a couple nights in Talkeetna and Seward before going on to Homer for the last three nights of our trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, we rented a nice House that sat on a little bluff above the Sterling Hwy on the outskirts coming in to the town of Homer.  It had a great view of the town, bay and mountains around Homer.  At approximately 1 am on July 18, 2012 I was relaxing in the hot tub the house had on its ground level deck when I noticed what was at first very faint lights I thought were satellites.  But quickly I realized that they were not satellites, at least not ones of any conventional variety that I know of because the lights increased and decreased in their luminosity significantly while at the same time executing what almost looked like geometric patterns coupled with darting movements in the same general vicinity of sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what satellites look and move like and they sure don’t dart back in forth like these things did.  I know what iridium flares look like as well and I’m almost 100% certain what I saw and photographed was not that.  The lights also seemed to flash in and out in different positions in an instant.  Anyway I continued watching whatever this was for a couple more minutes when the thought finally occurred to me to go in and get my camera to take some pictures so that’s what I did.  It probably took me two or three minutes to towel off a little and run in and get my camera ready.  I took 15 photos between 1:07:09am and 1:10:45am according to the time stamp on the photos.  Some were taken seconds apart and show nothing in the sky and then in the following photos something is streaking across sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vantage point of the photos was from me on my back laying down on the deck and looking up and to a general southwest direction.  In some of the photos part of the roof of the house is present as are a couple of trees.  I took one photo almost all the way zoomed in and the rest were taken at basically the same zoom.  The only thing I did to the photos is to hit the enhance color button in the iPhoto application on my MacBook Pro but I still have the originals on my digital SD card.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I took the photos I took the camera back inside and tried to look at the photos on my little digital screen on the camera but they just looked dark and I didn’t notice that I captured something strange that correlated with what my eyes were seeing until I got back home and pulled them up on my computer.  I did however go back outside after taking the photos and continued to watch the dancing lights for about 10 more minutes until I sort of freaked out upon the sudden realization that the rest of my family is asleep and I’m out here alone watching god knows what.  So I went inside and tried to go sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was very close and was def some kind of craft.  There is a video from one yr ago the exact same date of a very similiar set of lights moving on the coast.

The two orange lights were at the same elevation, several thousand feet by what I could tell.  I wanted to get home to get a camera or chase the object but it disappeared.  Simply as if someone had shut off a switch.  I was wondering if anyone besides me saw anything that night (7-17-12) please inform me if anyone else saw this<n>

The objects at first were very intense in color.  There were 2 orange orbs and one red orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the objects seemed like they were all one massive entity.  They were rotating in a clockwise direction and I would estimate the object to have been somewhere around 500 feet across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object got well about the top of the mountain it started to move in a northerly direction. Not long after it began to move north is when I began to notice the object was actually 3 smaller objects flying in formation because they began to split up and moved from a triangle formation to a straight line. They were about 500 feet apart in a straight line and as this happened the lights started to get dim and for about 30 seconds they would disappear and reappear but only dimly until they finally vanished.<n>

If I have the time I chase them to take pictures and videos.  This specific day was no different than other hot and humid days where storms get predicted.  At 7:15 pm I drove up Corliss Hill in Meredith NH and turned down Lindsey Court which is an empty cul-de-sac.  Facing South I started video taking the storm over the tree tops while speaking to my husband on the speaker phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I did not realize what I had picked up until I viewed all the videos on July 21.  Going frame-by-frame to capture lightning images something caught my eye on the video. It started on the bottom left of the sky on the video; a grayish cylinder shape object flying at an angle towards the top of the video.  Four frames were caught between the video length times of 0:3:17:13 – 0:3:17:16.  Looking at the video at normal speed it went so fast anyone could have missed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried debunking the ob!ject with no luck.  All I can say is that it was no bird, bug, debris or plane. The only explanation I have is that I caught a UFO on my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the video, and see a very vague, out-of-focus object.  We suspect that it may be a bird, or an insect.  PD))<n>

It was a beautiful summer day, blue skies, almost no clouds.  As I sat in a lawnchair, I looked skyward and I noticed a commercial airliner flying over high in the sky, I could see the two exhaust jets that are common behind airliners, being the middle of the day I didn’t think much about it.  However moments later I realized something wasn’t right about what I just saw.  I looked back up and realized I was seeing something I had not seen before.  Trailing the aircraft, at not that great of a distance was a white cylindrical cigar shaped object.  It was not all that spectacular, but I realized I had never seen an object like this before.  There were no wings, just a long white cylindrical cigar shaped object following the airliner through the sky.  There was also no visible exhaust coming from this object, it just appeared to be cruising through the sky.   As I watched the airliner and the object the! y disappeared behind some trees, and I was not able to see the two again.  A couple of days later I was fishing with my brother and I told him what I saw.  He said “no way I just watched a show and they were talking about unidentified flying objects, and your description was almost identical to what was on the show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been almost a year since I saw this object, and I never thought about reporting it until a few days ago.  The reason being I happened to stumble upon your website and noticed the ease of making my report.  I know my encounter isn’t that spectacular, but I thought someone ought to know.  My dates may not be correct but the time and circumstances of my sighting I am fairly confident in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date may be approximate.

Walking back to the house, I looked up and noticed the light had not moved.I stood there approx. 5 minutes to make sure it had not moved and then I walked another few steps and observed it thru&#39; a gap in the tree foliage and it remained absolutely stationery.  It did not seem to be flashing or making any form of movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching it for another 5 minutes or so, I concluded it must be a cell phone or other tower that I had not noticed inspite of it being very high and even though I have lived here for 30 + years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went out later that day, I looked in that direction but there is no such structure where I had seen the lights.  I have looked in that direction several times since and there is nothing there to have caused that light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a very very normal everyday person (retired) and am puzzled and perhaps a tiny bit scared of what I may have seen.  It was not a plane as it was not moving, too large to be a star (at least 10 times bigger than the North star) and way too high up to be a man made structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a little different so I did a double take and walked back out to our front field.  I saw it was heading in my direction so I decided to wait for it to pass me just to verify it was an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached I saw it slightly gain altitude and then descend again.  It was moving back and forth to the right and left, but very slightly.

It looked almost like a cylindrical glow stick.  It moved quite fast along the horizon, made an almost 90 degree upward turn, looped around, aproached the shore, and then zig-zaged out to sea, or into the water.

It did not have white or green lights on it. It was fairly high in the sky for most of the sighting (about 30 mins duration).  Towards the end of the sighting, it seemed to have lowered in altitude and gone slightly more westward.  The night was clear and the object appeared below the big dipper constellation.  It did not have noise to it nor did it have a trail.<n>

7/16/12 23:40|Mt.

Pleasant, IA at the Henry County Fairgrounds.  A friend and I were talking on the corner of where the main road through the grounds and the road to the east of the project building meet.  I was facing north, her to the south. I was listening to her talk and as I was looking at her, all of the sudden, out of nowhere I see a large fireball object in the sky behind her. It was up above the tree line to the north, which if you are looking from the place we were standing, isn’t too terribly far.  It was red/orange in color and started to rise up in the sky slowly. It then stopped moving higher up and appeared to be moving closer to us (or farther south) and east as well and was glowing brighter orange. It continued in a sort of U-shape or a half-loop because it kept getting farther south and east. As it travelled this path, the color appeared to pulsate. It then reached a point where it started to get farther away! from us (or back to the north again). As soon as it hit that point where it started to appear to head back north again, it suddenly began to rapidly glow dimmer and stopped the pulsating effect. It faded to white rather quickly right before our eyes, though still very visible at that point. It wasn’t too much longer that the white object appeared to change course yet again, heading directly north and in less than 5 seconds it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole event was quite perplexing especially since the object was in the sky for no more than 3 minutes. First of all, there was no noise from this object. All day I work around crop dusters and I can hear them from an even farther distance than this object was to us. If it were a helicopter it definitely could have been heard as well. Second of all, if it were a plane or helicopter, why would it be flying in that sort of pattern? If it was a medical helicopter, it certainly wouldn’t be flying that way considering the locations of the hospitals in that part of the state. Third, the duration of this event was crazy. We should have been able to follow this object in the sky a lot longer. It was a crystal clear night! We could see many satellites and other objects in the sky and we noted how slow moving they were, how far away we could see them from, and also how clear and crisp their lights were.  The object we saw had no definite shape, no consistent color, and no consis! tent pattern or flashing of its light. We cannot come up with an explanation of what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One final event that went on about 10 minutes after the sighting: there were a lot of chickens, turkeys, ducks, and other birds in cages in a small open sided building right south in front of the project building (to the west of us). These animals had been quiet all night besides an occasional cluck. But as my friend and I were discussing the event, as I said around 10 minutes afterwards, they just went berserk. All of the livestock were making some sort of noise and it was loud even from where we were! They carried on at the same noise level for close to 4 minutes and all of the sudden just stopped. Absolutely nothing had changed from the time that we had been standing outside other than us seeing that object in the sky, so whatever caused them to get all riled up is a mystery, too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am just blown away. I have always been skeptical of “UFO’s”, always laughing when shows came on the TV about them or writing people off as crazy that had sighted them or shared stories of them. I know I’m not crazy, so there goes my original theory. I’m starting to pay a little more attention to these occurrences now.  My friend has never had any experiences involving UFO’s before either, so she was shocked at what we saw as well. But questions we will likely never answer are why us, why then, and why there? The odds of it happening are unreal and I’m still in shock as to what went on.<n>

Suddenly I saw round blue light flash at 80 degrees like a shooting star, but much bigger and closer and for a very short span of time 2-3 seconds.  No noise, disturbance, or heat was generated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I thought it was a shooting star, but from what I know we used to spot shooting stars in the months of September and October. The strange flash of light was observed in the western skies of Gurgaon city, in Haryana State India. The aeroplanes flying at the hour did not seem to be affected and were at great distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to state that there is a business corridor near our house but all shut down and there were no lasers lights which is pretty common these days in Gurgaon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Gurgaon : latitude 28°27&#39;N longitude 77°01&#39;E.<n>

The light fell predictably (as if it were a shooting star), but it changed colors from white to red to green.  After the light fell below tree line, it reversed its course and came back up into the sky before it fell back to Earth again (it was pink in color).  This reverse pattern is what leads me to believe it wasn&#39;t a meteor or comet.  I drove along airport road looking for people who may have been shooting fireworks, but there is a fire ban in Breckenridge and this light action was seen along the highway where shooting fireworks would be quite risky.  I couldn&#39;t find any people or any action of sorts.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light would pulse to just a bit brighter than a star then fade away to nothing. It was a quick pulse and the time between flashes was roughly 10 seconds; it was a consistent gap of time between flashing intervals.  It remained stationary in the sky and continued this behaviour for about 5 minutes, after which it didn’t appear again.<n>

I noticed a point of light as bright as Venus, halfway between Polaris and the horizon.  As I watched, the light moved very slightly eastward and, while moving, faded from a bright point of light to nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved to the right then to the left, thinking that my view might have been obscured by a couple of spindly palm trees which were there. I never saw the light after it faded.  I saw no airplane lights at any time and there are no stars that bright in that part of the sky.<n>

Like gray sky..  You couldn&#39;t really distinguish one cloud.  There had been airplanes passing above and near us.  We could HEAR them but not SEE them because that&#39;s how cloudy it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So anyway we were sitting there and we saw a BRIGHT green neon light orb looking about hmm a mile away.  It was hovering and then switched to a bright red/white light and then back to green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a constant green light.  It was NOT flashing.  The only time it flashed was when it was red/white for like 4 seconds.  The light was moving really fast towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (South) and then it went back really quickly and then it was moving downwards really fast and then to the sides..  THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN AIRPLANE or a JET or helicopter.. the angles it was moving in were crazy.

Observed from NE corner of Richfield MN, flying in a NW-ly direction from approx 90 degrees of observer viewpoint to approx 350 degrees of observer viewpoint.  No sudden speed changes or direction changes.  Observer opened house window to listen for sound, but no noticeable sound observed.  Observed close to MSP airport, but light would have traveled from the SE to the NW of the airfield with no change in altitude.  Observer transferred from E facing to N facing window of house as it passed over, but lost track momentarily before picking it up as a faint but disappearing light traveling to the NW.  Seemed as if it could have been illuminated by the sun (which had set) perhaps as a result of very high altitude, since the illumination only appeared to emanate from the W facing side.  Brightness similar to sodium vapor streetlights 1! /2 block away.<n>

Our home sits at a higher elevation where one has a view over the neighboring homes from the second story.  As the objects passed over our home, the girls ran downstairs and yelled for me to get out on the back deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran out onto our deck, looked up, and immediately noticed 2 bright red-white glowing objects at about 80 degrees overhead moving silently in a E-SE direction.  They appeared to be at about the same altitude but the object on the right was slightly ahead of the other.  They held the same spacing as they continued to travel over the treetops away from the house (maintaining the same course).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they moved farther away, the one on the right seemed to get smaller faster and then disappeared.  The one on the left continued to be visible for about another 15 seconds and then also disappeared.  Just prior to disappearing, the glow seemed to move slightly in an upward trajectory before vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were not airplanes as there were several planes visible at the same time in the clear night sky (higher altitudes and different locations).  There were no blinking lights, just a constant colored glow.  The objects were also extremely large compared to the planes flying beyond them overhead in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects had a brilliant red/white glow (bright like a flare - but not a flare as there was no trajectory... just a straight steady movement from west of our home, overhead, and then eastward until gone).  The light was not from a jet engine as the brilliant red-white glow was the same when the objects moved towards us from the west, over, and away from us towards the east.  Both wife and daughter said everything was the same in appearance from the window looking out the front of the house as from the deck on the back of the house... other than at some point over our house the third glowing object vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the objects when I first saw them from the back deck were about that of a quarter held at arms length.  As they traversed away from the house towards the horizon, they got smaller to about the size of an an aspirin held at arms length before vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after vanishing, beyond where the glowing objects were last seen, I noticed a lighted object streaking across the sky (right to left) at about a 45 degree angle upwards (horizon towards the atmosphere).  It was just visible to the eye and I lost track of it behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise associated with the objects.  They were definitely closer than any planes but there was complete silence in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after vanishing, beyond where the glowing objects were last seen, I noticed a lighted object streaking across the sky (right to left or SE towards the N) at about a 45 degree angle upwards (horizon towards the atmosphere).  It was just visible to the eye and I lost track of it behind some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surface wind conditions at the time were 0-2mph and temps in the low 80s.  The sky was clear with no moon.  No urban lights behind our home (woods).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

They seemed to appear and disappear without movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked again after 5 mins and saw 4 of these objects in a perfect diagonal line which stayed stationary.  I then called the police dept to see if anyone else had reported the same sightings (no one had), and they put me through to the Coast Guard who took my information.  They seemed to move at this point before disappearing.<n>

I was wheeling the trash out to the end of the driveway for the Friday morning pickup when I looked up and noticed a light in the northern horizon.  At first I thought this was a landing light of a craft coming into Harrisburg, then I realized the bearing of this craft was southerly, and if the craft was moving easterly or northerly to land at Harrisburg I would not see the light. Realizing that Washington was too far south for the landing light to be activated my attention was now focused on this light. The light was queer in that it was not as bright as landing lights which I have witnessed before, and oddly there was no beam projecting from the light and no streaking  emanating about the light which would normally be noticed with a bright light in the sky. It was like a dull light, for lack of a better explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for at least 5 minutes for whatever this light was coming from to pass over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What passed was not expected. It was a “simple delta wing” craft with an estimated length of 300 feet and an estimated width at base of 200 feet travelling at an estimated height of 1000 feet. The course of travel was south by southwest and it was passing over our house and our neighbors house to the right with the better part over our neighbors house, allowing me to get a better perspective on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutely no noise. There were no markings. The color was a very dull sheen. The craft was moving so slowly I could not estimate the speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft passed over the view of the underside was unobstructed. Since it was at dusk, but not dark, I could see what is best described as a half walnut pod on the underside, with an estimated length of 100 feet. On the side of the pod was a horizontal single row of what I first thought appeared like rectangular shaped windows but soon realized were not windows. Emanating from each rectangular shape was a grayish-greenish cast with an undulating darker gray shadow in the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft passed over and the back of the craft was coming into view I realized there were no other lights on the craft and no conventional tail section. I estimate the depth of the pod at maybe 20-30 feet and the depth of the main body also at 20-30 feet. I use the word estimate throughout this explanation as my perspective is based on viewing conventional craft. This craft could have been considerably larger but my senses were it approximated my noted dimensions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not frightened, I was intrigued, almost mesmerized by the craft. As the craft passed I briefly remember thinking if this was the “Aurora” program it was based on no known technology of today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Beyond relating my observations to my wife, in a rather animated manner, I have related very little to very few.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The part which bothers me the most is the clarity of this my observation and the fact that I can’t seem to stop thinking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Watching clouds and tracking I-15 below.  The I-15 was starting to angle to the north towards Las Vegas.   At that time we entered an area with scattered large cumulonimbus clouds about 1 to 1.5 miles to our north and a solid cloud cover below us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was lookng out I saw a dull red type rust colored object the size of a large semi truck cab, It was the shape of a jelly bean with no wings, windows, or any other identifying markers as it flew by.  It was about a mile away at the same level we were flying.   It was traveling at least twice the speed we were flying.  Then it made a sharp left turn as it flew ahead of us and dissapeared into the cloud mass heading north.<n>

The &#34;ball of fire&#34; then ferried toward my location.  As it was approaching I realized it was an egg shaped object with flames around the bottom.  I ran in and got my wife.  As we watched the object got closer to us then turned toward the North and was gone.  We waited and watched the sky and pretty soon(within 5 minutes) the object appeared again in the East and traveled west towards us, turned north and then was gone again and it did not return.  I was wondering if it was a drone or something like that it looked like it was following the same pattern, maybe marking a grid or something.  I would just like to know if you have heard of anything in the area that could have been perceived as what I described, I would appreciate any feedback.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

It was approximately 1:45AM.  I looked up and through my windshield I saw at first one, and then a second, bright oval object.  They sort of flitted as a kite would in a straight upward trajectory with one higher up than the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of my car and stared stunned, as I’d never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both were an oval shape and both were flashes of what one could describe as a ball of fire.  It was a foggy night.  When I say they flitted as a kite, it was as if they were flapping their wings and swaying as they headed straight upwards.  And then first one, and then the other, disappeared into the sky.  I heard no sounds.<n>

I noticed an orange light to the northeast of us moving fairly quickly in a diagonal direction from right to left, from about 30 degrees to 60 degrees above the horizon.  It then stopped fairly abruptly and just hovered there for some time.  It then started to move slowly in a random pattern, kind of like a doodleart drawing, but not too far from a stationary position.  I used a street sign and a nearby object as a reference to see if it was just the illusion of movement or was actually moving, which it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While generally stationary the light grew in intensity, and was quite bright, and seemed quite big.  It was slowly pulsing/shimmering, and was kind of fuzzy at the edges, kind of like the sun&#39;s corona but not as intense as the light itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbours work at Pearson Intl. Airport, and all four of us were quite certain it wasn&#39;t a plane, or a flare, due to its strange movement, seeming close proximity, the lack of landing lights, and no noise.  Airplanes do often track over our neighbourhood, so we are very familiar as to what they look/sound like, and they tend to follow the same track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we studied it for a few minutes, it started to move again left to right, and then stopped again for a short time.  After stopping for a bit, it slowly diminished in intensity and winked out, but not before very briefly (1-2 sec) getting a bit brighter.<n>

I have a habit of observing the skies at night, ironically enough looking for UFO events.  I looked to the southeast at about a 35 degree angle, when I noticed a star that was slightly bigger then the others.  As I was observing it, it slowly drifted lazily down and to the left.  I called my friend over and for around 15 to 25 minutes we watched it.  It would stop moving about every five minutes.  It would just drift more and more to the horizon. It moved VERY slowly.  When it was about 20 degrees above the horizon, we saw a plane fly in it’s direction.  It then moved at a very quick speed down, before it disappeared on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked just like a star, just bigger. And a golden-yellow color, almost as if it was engulfed in a golden light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

At first I thought helicopters, but they had no sound, were too big, orange in color and moving at the same pace and direction too steadily.  One was obscured by clouds momentarily then appeared to be moving higher until it disappeared.  The other continued overhead on it&#39;s course until it was out of view.  They&#39;re size was of that similar to a small moon.  They&#39;re speed was very slow and consistent.  They definitely weren&#39;t meteors, they had no fire trails, they weren&#39;t flickering, and were moving far too slowly. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen.  Although I have searched the web for explanations I can fin! d non.  However I have found many similar sightings and videos recorded from around the world since 2009, again with no explanations.<n>

Every time the light seemed to stop the light went from pure white, mint green, and finally dark green and grew intensely bright. We lost sight of the light for a few seconds then suddenly we all saw the light again.  The only way we could explain its light going completely out.<n>

The flight pattern was erratic but the object was traveling at about the speed of a small airplane. The object was over the Atlantic Ocean and moving towards land. We were able to observe it for approximately 30 to 45 seconds before its flight pattern took ti behind a hotel and we never saw it appear again.  It was nearly 11:00 PM EST when we first saw the object and we even discussed it with the group of people who were playing ahead of us.   They asked us if we knew what it was but none of us had any idea.  There was no sound associated with he object nor was there any sign of exhaust or heat trail.<n>

Its orientation was at about a 45 degree angle from dead staight on.  It was just over the horizion to the right of me apparently about 5 miles away. Its was aprox. the size of my fist held out at arms length.  It was over the Atlantic Ocean as the bay and the ocean are about 100-150 yards away from this highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer the 10-14 lights retained a circular shape, and appeared to get bigger.  As it moved closer following the shoreline the object tilted from its top towards me while retaining its general 45 degree orientation to flat on.  At this point I realized that this was a disk shape. It continued to move past on the right until it left my feild of vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The final size was aprox. 20 &amp;quot;fists&amp;quot;.

I then sprinted home as I kept my eyes on the sky.  There were 6 or 7 bright orange lights, they were all moving together at a right angle.  One light did a question mark shape movement from the bottom up to line up in the formation of a back slash.  To the right of those, there was a formation of a triangle.  They all were moving  together at an angle and disappeared into some clouds. I waited for them to pass through the cloud and come out the other side, but they never did.  The cloud was thin and you see the lights get smaller in them.  After that I rang the doorbell to get my parents attention to see the lights, all the lights had disappeared, but my mother managed to see one new orange  light that was moving slower than the o! thers, but then soon disappeared into the same  cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My ten year old daughter saw it first through our large windows on the back of our house. She ran out onto our back deck and yelled for me to come outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a bright, glowing object, mostly orange with some red as well, and the lights were pulsating. The lights would get slightly larger, then smaller as it slowly moved (slower than plane) across a small portion of the sky.  It&#39;s tough to say what its exact shape was, because the object&#39;s glowing lights were so bright...but it seemed to be oblong, with the lights glowing more strongly towards the middle and back of the object.  It didn&#39;t make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was heading in a southwest direction, but after a minute or so, it started gaining elevation at a quick rate, getting smaller, into a pinpoint light into the sky, and then disappeared.  At first, it was lower in the sky than most planes, but by the time it left, it looked as far away as a star.  I was amazed how fast it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called for my husband to see it and he also said that he hadn&#39;t ever seen anything like it and it certainly wasn&#39;t a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then asked my daughter how she first noticed it and she said it was first at the tree line level (near the top of some tall pine trees) and very large.  I asked her how large and she said it was huge.  It it looked like, in her words &#34;a huge, glowing lantern that was floating up over the trees.&#34;<n>

They would go in little circles and curlicues and then dissapear and reapear in another part of the sky, I think there were two of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were way too fast to be a jet or plane, and they flew in patterns/circles like I said, so there&#39;s no way it was a bird either, and they were too far away, not to mention the lights.  It was so crazy we watched them for like almost an hour, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it, they just kept disappearing and reapearing all over the place, it was....phenomenal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just saw one tonight, just for a second then it was gone, which made me decide to ask google if anyone else had seen them, lol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the lights were just white, no red, and it almost looked like the lights were spinning, if you know what I mean, but they were too! far away to really tell.  I&#39;m trying so think of more ways to describe them, but all I know for sure is that I don&#39;t know of anything that moves that way, definitely too fast for a satellite, etc.  Maybe we aren&#39;t alone in the universe after all... :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

7/14/12 21:55|Kenner|LA|Light|a few minutes|Five motionless red lights in a roughly triangular formation sighted in north Kenner, Louisiana.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90964.html|412|ndxe201207| Five motionless red lights in a roughly triangular formation sighted in north Kenner, Louisiana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday night, July 14, 2012, my wife and I were driving west on West Esplanade Ave. in Kenner, Louisiana and turned north northwest onto Driftwood Blvd.  Straight ahead were red lights in the sky in formation.  We turned left onto Emile Ave. and could not see the lights.  We turned right onto Osborne Ave. but the lights were hidden by trees.  I told my wife about them and we drove down Osborne and could see them to the north when we passed by houses without trees.  We turned right (due north) on Gelpi Ave. and could see five red lights in the sky in a roughly triangular formation.  They did not appear to be moving.  They seemed to be suspended and motionless in the sky. They were relatively high in the sky.  From our vantage point, I would estimate that they were between 30° to 45° up into the sky. We assumed that they were over Lake Pontchartrain.  As we continued driving north trying to find an unobscured viewing area, the lights suddenly faded and di! sappeared.  Disappointed, we turned around and headed home.  At this point, I looked at the clock on my dashboard and mentally noted that it was at exactly 10:00 PM CDT.  What was unusual about these lights is that they were above the normal flight path of planes landing or taking off from New Orleans International Airport.  We see jet lights all the time.  These were not jet lights.  I don’t know what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/14/12 21:50|Culver|IN|Circle|~40 minutes|Round orange light/object moved in line, stopped & stayed in place, seemed to quiver, then left abrubtly.

Repeated this several tiimes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of us were on a pier by a large lake watching fireworks that were at one end of the lake to the west. It was very dark out, about 9:50 pm, and we noticed a perfectly round, very orange light or object moving slowly and steadily high above the treeline at the southeast side of the lake.  The object appeared to stop, then it &amp;quot;quivered&amp;quot; a little then went quickly in a direction somewhat up and away from where we were watching.  Several minutes later, it (or another one) appeared again in virtually the same area, moved along what seemed to be a similar path as the other one, stopped, then went directly east rather than in a more upward trajectory as the first one did.  We saw three more of these do virtually the same thing, all several minutes apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five friends came by boat after watching the fireworks from the water and they asked if we had seen that odd round orange object -- they had seen it from across the lake.  One of us is in aviation and said that it was definitely not an airplane. Nor was it a flare.  Additionally, some of the people who had been in the boat were out looking at the stars about a half hour after we had gone in and reported seeing the object higher in the night sky on the other side of the lake from where we all had originally seen it.  It looked just like a round tail light of an older truck, only it was the same color as an orange popsicle.<n>
7/14/12 21:45|St. Pete Beach|FL|Fireball|5-10 minutes|20-40 ORANGE/RED FIREBALLS TRAVELING NORTH OVER ST PETE BEACH-DISAPPEARING OVER GULF|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90907.html|414|ndxe201207| 20-40 ORANGE/RED FIREBALLS TRAVELING NORTH OVER ST PETE BEACH-DISAPPEARING OVER GULF<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 9:45pm 7-14-2012, my son and I where in the backyard of our house, which is located at the northern end in the center of the barrier island.  We were sitting around a campfire facing south when I looked up and noticed a group of 4 or 5 bright orange/red balls of light traveling north along the coastline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance I  thought they were fireworks as they are commonly shot off on the beach, the group was then followed by another group of approximately 6-8 lights traveling in a row at slightly uneven looking altitudes, the groups all veered  west directly toward the Gulf of Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound from them and they did not appear to be at very high altitudes, maybe 1500-2000ft, but quickly climbed higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once they were roughly what appeared to be about a hundred yards south of the house over the coastline, they veered west into the Gulf of Mexico and within a few seconds would disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then thought this may be some maneuvers from! nearby Macdill Air force base.  Then, another group, this one more spread out than the 1st two appeared and followed the same flightpath as the others and disappeared with 5-10 seconds of veering west into the gulf from the coastline.  Then another group appeared and then  another, so I grabbed my camera and began recording them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole episode lasted about I’d say 10 minutes tops with approximately 20-40 orange/red balls of light passing overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then several minutes after the last group disappeared a single ball came up (like a stragler) and followed the same route as the others. I was able to capture about 4 mintues on my video camera.<n>
7/14/12 21:45|Brookville|OH|Light|0:45|Four white lights moving into random formations seen above trees|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90898.html|415|ndxe201207| Four white lights moving into random formations seen above trees<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dusk, and while driving we noticed a large white light in the sky to the Southeast. It was mostly cloudy, and it was hovering well below the clouds, fairly close to the tree horizon in the distance. It was approx. 6-8 times the size of a normal bright star, so it caught our attention very quickly. Shortly thereafter another light appeared below it, then another, and then one more.  They were all moving slowly and together formed a skinny trapezoid shape.  They continued to move around a bit, some much faster than others, and took other formations (perfect square, another trapezoid).  A couple of them slowly disappeared and reappeared as they moved around as well, almost twinkling at times. They eventually all moved below the tree horizon in the distance. It&#39;s hard to say how far away they may have been, but my guess would be ~3-5 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three observers are all between the ages of 28-32, upper middle class, two males and one female. No one was under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.  We were coming home from a jog and the grocery - we tried to take a couple pictures but they were too blurry in the low light.<n>
7/14/12 21:45|St. Pete Beach|FL|Fireball|10 minutes|20-30 ORANGE/RED FIREBALLS TRAVEL NORTH OVER ST PETE BEACH AND VANISH OVER GULF|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90939.html|416|ndxe201207| 20-30 ORANGE/RED FIREBALLS TRAVEL NORTH OVER ST PETE BEACH AND VANISH OVER GULF<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is being added as an addition to the one filed on 07-15-2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As mentioned earlier, while my son and I were sitting in our backyard at 9:45pm facing south on the barrier island of St Pete Beach, FL, we observed several groups of orange/red amber balls of  light traveling north along the beach, then going west into the gulf and vanishing. I was able to video a few of the objects as they approached then veered off. Visibility was reported as 10 miles at the time of the occurrence with S/SSW winds of 5-10mph by NOAA during the time frame.  The camera I used to capture the objects was filming at 30 frames per second with approximately 12,000 frames of stills. Upon frame by frame analysis of the objects, they displayed unusual characteristics. The first set of lights were traveling in close pairs, one in front of the other or next to the other. The frames revealed the lights changing colors in fractions of a second randomly from red to blue, green, yellow or white. Also, a ball would randomly disappear in one frame while the ball next to it would not, then reappear in the next frame. The changing of colors  and disappearing then reappearing of the lights occurred throughout the filming and all the objects observed displayed these same characteristics. This was not visible while observing t! hem in the sky or while viewing the footage at a normal rate of speed. Additionally, later frames revealed other balls sporadically appearing and disappearing from frame to frame that were in the background of other light balls. Another set of frames shows 2 light balls. One remains stationary while the other one directly next to it  streaks west at an extreme rate of speed disappearing within fractions of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was falling slowly, leaving a trail behind it.  As it continued its vertical decent it separated--appearing to explode--into 3-4 smaller fragments, then fizzled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds later, it appeared as 3 separate lights and traveled in a triangular formation.  Again these lights, now as individual circular ones, seemed to disappear and seconds later appeared again but now there was a fourth one.  The lights continued their decent into the western sky.  Several of us captured photos on our phones until they were too far away to see.<n>

They appeared like fireworks at first, but continued higher and higher into the sky, very slowly, pulsating as they rose.  I realized they were not fireworks as almost thirty seconds passed and they were still rising.  The night sky was heavily clouded, and first one disappeared and then the second.  I had stopped my car and continued to watch the sky, thinking if they were airplanes, they would come out of the clouds.  They did not.  To my surprise, I saw another ball of fire rise from the woods, then a second, and then a third.  I grabbed my phone and called my friend at the house I had just left, perhaps a quarter of a mile away.  No answer.  The lobes arose as the first two and one after another, disappeared into the sky.  I called my friend back.  No answer.  Still parked along the road, I was amazed to see two more lobes come up from behind the trees.  I called my friend again, and this time s! he picked up.  Hurrying outside, she viewed the final two orbs as they arose into the clouds, pulsating and growing smaller and smaller until they disappeared.  The lobes rose for at least thirty seconds, and the groups were spaced apart approximately thirty seconds as well.  They whole event may have lasted three minutes, perhaps more.  I tried to film the event with my phone camera, but it was too dark out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We noticed it approximately at 1000 feet AGL flying east over Airway Heights, Washington, at approximately 50-70 kts. and turned south and increased altitude to approximate 6000-1000 feet AGL.  Increased speed to approximately 200-500 kts and disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they appeared to look light floating lanterns, and then ascended like helicopters with no sound.  The red one went up thought the clouds and disappeared.  The yellow one appeared to maneuver through the hole in the clouds to get to altitude and then disappeared out of sight to get to altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of us witnessed the sighting together.<n>

Movement was steady and slow enough that I had time to get binoculars.  Through the binoculars I saw a glowing orange light inside a round object, but neither myself, my mom, or step dad could explain what it was.  About ten minutes after the sighting of the first object, a series of three more moved across the sky in a fast succession, also from the southwest to northeast in the northwest area of the sky .  I went up on our finished roof and watched them travel to the northeast for several minutes before they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw one of the exact same objects several weeks ago in the western sky moving from south to north and also had time to view it with binoculars.  A few weeks before that, my friends and I saw about 7 of these objects from different origin points while fishing the beach at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keywords of the sighting: orange ball, fireball, sudden appearance, steady movement, several minutes of sighting time, rapid dissipation, multiple witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It had a light blue light and was about the size of a pea from where we were sitting.  It was stationary for a second or two and then moved in zigzag directions before it descended out of our site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought for sure it was a UFO and called Buckley Air Force Base.  The gentleman that answered the phone stated he did not hear of anything and responded to us as if we were crazy for asking. We knew it was not a plane, jet, or helicopter and before this day I was skeptic of so called UFO sightings. I am not for sure of the date this happened but it was in the summer of this year and was approximately 3 nights prior to the news story of the pilot who called his air traffic control people to state he just witnessed a UFO in flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never heard of this site before until I just read the news story from November 8th, of the UFO sighting in Denver.  Now it really has me curious as to what we saw.  The object was in the South-West sky.  The observers of this UFO were 4 families, including 4 children (ages 5 years old) who were also excited about seeing the object, asking what it was they had just witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I have three college degrees: a BA in History, a BA in Philosophy and a Juris Doctor degree.  I do not drink, do not use drugs and honestly have withheld this information along with my three friends who were with me at the time.  None of us are on medications or have any history of psychosis or psychotic episodes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all working on a construction project at the time of the sighting.  It occurred as follows:<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 14th of 2012 we drove out to the Moore Cut Off road in order to construct a cattle abatement/antelope crossing fence.  I remember the date because I had lived in France in 2002-2003 and was explaining to my coworkers about Bastille Day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started stretching wire and tying it to the t-posts around 8:30 am.  We approached a hill which had very large rocks jutting out of the side.  We all grouped together and a friend asked what time it was,  I checked my phone and saw that it was 10:38.  I remember this because we always guessed what time it was before looking and the closest person to the correct time was paid a dollar by the other coworkers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then glanced up at the full moon which was declining in the western sky.  I am an avid amateur astronomer and was marveling at the moon&#39;s position so late in the morning.  I then saw a shiny metallic shape located under the moon.  I quickly drew attention to it and asked one of my coworkers (who was attending aviation school) what type of plane it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He stated &#34;that&#39;s no plane I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;  Given our relative closeness to Area 51 (it&#39;s all desert from where we were to Area 51, hundreds of miles of nothing) we just chalked it up to some sort of new type of secret air craft that was classified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we sat down to watch it, but it was simply hovering in the same spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, in the blink of an eye, it darted across the sky.  I cannot begin to calculate the distance it covered, but my pilot friend said that there is no plane in existence that could travel that fast from a dead stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then started to realize that this was no ordinary aircraft, not even a secret air craft.  As we looked around the sky, we saw other aircraft flying east and south.  Each craft was moving extremely slowly compared to the object and they all had a trail behind them. There was no trail behind the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object as it hovered in the new location across the sky (to the north) of where the moon was positioned.  I told my friends to expect a sonic boom, but no sound came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then darted right back to the EXACT same position it had been under the moon.  This time it zig-zagged down going first to the right and then to the left, but it seemed to be moving downward away from the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 5 or 6 zig zags it stopped and then blasted straight up into the sky. It went in front of the moon and that&#39;s when I got the best glimpse of the object. It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to my friends &#34;please tell me you guys saw that...  That was the craziest thing I have ever seen.&#34;  They all agreed that they had seen the exact same thing.  I looked down at my phone to call my father (who works for the government) but I didn&#39;t have cell service.  8 minutes had passed and we all sat there for a while, dumbfounded at what we had seen and experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not saying that this was an alien aircraft or extra terrestrial life.  I will not presume to make such an assumption.  However, I do know that this thing moved unlike any aircraft we publicly know about to this day.  The amount of g-forces that this type of maneuvering would create would literally kill those pilots without some sort of advanced technology to mitigate the pressure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw though and all 3 of the other witnesses saw the same exact thing.  We still discuss it to this day when we all get together.<n>

I Seen something bright out of the coner of my eye  therefore I followed it with my eyes till it went out of sight. It seemed to be brighter than any white light I had ever seen, it was circular in shape. I looked over at my friend that was setting next to me, I ask him &amp;quot;did you see that?&amp;quot;.  He said &amp;quot;that ball of light?&amp;quot; I replied &amp;quot;yea, if we had blinked we would of missed it&amp;quot;.  I told him , im just glad you saw it too, I thought I might be loosing my mind for a second. Yet the ball shape of light, It seemed like it jus appeared out of nowhere then disappeared just as quick as it appeared. 7/14/12 roughly around 2:30am to 3am, UFO moved from south to north at an unbelievable amount of speed.

As soon we turned the corner, there was a very bright light, appeared to be just over the tree line in an area that is over a field and just west of Hulman Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both asking one another the question, &#34;What in the heck is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stayed perfectly still like it was sitting on a light post and then about the time we get to the intersection of U.S. 46 and U.S. 42 it takes off south.  In my mind, I thought it was like a firework, it took off quickly, but was way too big for that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also my recollection was that after about 500 feet, I thought it went down, and I was actually waiting for something to explode, it did not.  My wife said she saw it go several miles away turning into a small dot almost instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both in awe at this point and kept driving toward where it was and when we got to that point, there was still a trail of smoke that was about the 500 feet (guessing), then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear night.<n>

7/13/12 22:54|Winnipeg (Canada)|MB|Oval|# 1/2-4 minutes|Orange UFO flying low through south Winnipeg|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90860.html|431|ndxe201207| Orange UFO flying low through south Winnipeg<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  witnessed something really weird in the  St.Norbert area of Winnipeg last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home ( no alcohol) and saw a bright orange oval shaped light travelling very low, approx. 500-600 feet  and only going about  25 mph or so . First thing I thought was this is a plane , it`s got to be a plane , but after I approached  a stop sign , I got out of my vehicle and got a good look at it &amp;  it was  oval shaped and with a bright orange glow  lit from within . It was also WAY too low and going really slow about 25 mph. Now , i`m not delusional by any means , I know what I saw, as a matter 0of fact I ended up following it THROUGH st.norbert until it slowed right down and STOPPED . I got out of my vehicle and shut the engine off,  &amp; this thing was absolutely silent !  I watched it for about 15 seconds and it started flying away at a faster pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed it up to near pembina hwy &amp; the intersection of hwy # 75 and lost it from sight .  I have to tell you , i`m an amatuer  astronomer , and an aviation buff and  i`ve never seen anything like this at all. I noted the time when this happened, it was 10:54pm on the clock in my vehicle. The whole event lasted approx.  3 1/2 -4 minutes total from the time I acquired it  till it flew out of sight .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The hair on the back of my neck was/ is  standing on end , this just wasn`t right.  The way it was moving  around  sort of skipping really got to me. It wasn`t flying in a straight path  ( almost like it was wandering around, quite bizzare)  This was not an R/C  aircraft  or anything else I can think of . ( no noise at all &amp; too big)  I just had to tell someone , it was a really nice night out, so someone else had to see it , it`s just  not the kind of thing you miss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was friday the 13th and everything , but this is not a joke in any way, shape or form . I wish I had a camera with me , I can tell you that I will be keeping one in my vehicle for good after what happened tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It`s important that someone else know what  happened out here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I`m not sure if the Airport in WPG  would have picked anything up on radar or not  , as it was flying really low , again  estimate about 5-600 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This   was just stunning , I could barely keep my vehicle on the road as I drove following it  through the area . I don`t think i`ll ever witness something like that again ...<n>

At first I thought it was an airplane on fire but there was no sound.  It was very large in the sky, and it was moving quite quickly.  I got my parents and a pair of binoculars but it was to far away to see anything by then.  It also seemed like it was not moving in a straight line but rather traveled on a slightly curved path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 3 to 5 minutes it had moved out of sight.  I was not going to mention this but it was a box at the bottom of the report but a truck did stop working right as it passed by but other electroics in the area were unaffected so it may have been coincidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also it was heading east if that is important.<n>

It appeared from behind the tree line, like an orange glowing sphere.  It continued to come closer and appeared to stager but was continuing on a path of some sort.  It then seemed to get farther away and higher up at a steady pace until it flew out of sight behind the tree line.  It appeared to travel across the night sky about the speed and pace of an airliner taking about 2 minutes.  Three of us attempted to photograph this with our phones, but the photos came out black.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had a clear line of sight for miles.  As we where watching a triangular shape began to take shape (lights only), but moving together. They past us right over head..no sound!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all of a sudden one by one the amber colored bright lights began to fade away.  We thought that was it! Nope....9 more came, one by one they followed the large light pattern that we first had noticed...all i can say is having knowledge of aircraft and in the industry for years.... no this isnt ours. the lights also began to change color...hard to discribe, (muti colored) never saw this type of light on any of our aircraft......NEVER!!!!!<n>

It looked like a hot air balloon with a really wide base.  It had a row of red blinking lights that would blink on and off in a rotating motion and would change direction and did not seem to follow any perticular pattern.  What alarmed me was the fact it wasn&#39;t moving and was just hovering in one spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a minute or so and then I went and got my husband.  We watched the object for about another 20 seconds and then it just shot through the air leaving a streak of light like a shooting star does. We bought our house 2 years and this is our second experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several months ago my husband stepped out back which faces north east and saw a very bright light that was so bright it hurt to look at it and that it was a disc shaped object, not sure how to judge its size.  It was right above the tree line several acres back on our property.  It scared him so he went back inside for a few minutes.  He went back outside a few minutes later so try to get a better look at it and it was gone.<n>

And we also saw something pulse 4 times like a electric  haze looking type of light blue-green in color,but dim, then nothing,that was a first of that kind of sighting.  When viewing these in binoculars they appear to be slightly orangeish in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have checked satellite info,and these dont match up,plus some travel in the same path it seems in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, we have noticed an increase in planes in our are lately too,maybe just a coincidence.It seem some are just flying back and forth alot,these are much higher in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There were 3 lights in a kind of a arch in the sky at least 50-100 feet apart.  When I looked I could only see the lights and no other object attached.  There was absolutely no noise.  The lights kept a uniform distance from each other and moved in tandem.  Just as I thought we were getting closer to them they started going north and disappeared or left the sky. REALLY this was so WEIRD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was at least one car pulled over with people looking and pointing at what we were seeing.<n>

Caught out of the corner of my eye a bright object coming over the horizon (I was facing south).  It was bright orange with a red spot behind it.  Very large and bright, moving slow, rising at a 30 degree angle or so.  Seemed to stop and then turn toward us, which is toward the left (eastwardly) then started heading back toward the horizon.  Once it started turning the light started dimming quickly, and completely went out before reaching the horizon.  The lights were solid, no flashing and the red disappeared light disappeared at the turning point.   This lasted for about 1 minute.  Once lights disappeared the neighbor’s horse went silent.  The sky was clear and hadn’t noticed any stars yet.  Probably about 9:30pm.  The horizon is not far from us, about two miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sit out quite often and watch the sky.

Out of my driver-side window,I noticed in the sky above what first appeared to me as a flight of military helicopters with their search lights on and pointing forward.  The light, however, was orange,like from a sodium vapor lamp, not white like a helicopter light, and the light appeared on top of the objects and not to their front, as a search light or a car headlight would be aimed.  The objects that eminated this orange light appeared also to be flying in formation, possibly 1000 feet+ above the ground.  They were travelling in a west-southwesterly direction and crossed over US Route 30 directly above me at a speed similar to a helicopter or small plane.  There apeared to be several objects in a group, and several groups, one coming after another. These objects were flying in formation and their flight path was straight and unwavering.  There had to be at ! least several dozen objects as described herein in this sighting. I turned off my car radio and wound down my window to hear the helicopter rotors but was very surprised to hear absolutely no noise at all.  The objects were flying low enough to observe that they appeared to have an opaque base with a somewhat conical orange light located above the base.  If not helicopters, I thought they could possibly be balloons, but I cannot figure out how they all would have been lighted in exactly the same manner and flying in formations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this and am very confused about what these strange lights could have been.<n>

Stars were becoming visible in much of the sky.  We were turned towards the east and saw a large orange ball rise over the tree lines.   It pulsated.  It had no additional lights.  It was just a large circle, much larger, brighter, more orange than any traditional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We killed the boats engine to listen and it was silent.  It crossed south to north in front of us and every adult on the boat was confused by it&#39;s lack of identifying lights, shapes or sounds.  It went fairly slow for something that seemed lower, like the height of a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared to grow brighter ad then weaker.  Then it disappeared right in the middle of the sky.  Like someone turned the light out.   It flickered out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Entire duration 3 to 4 minutes.

Coming from the south I drive to the city Rapperswil.  On the so called Seedamm I cross the Lake of Zürich.  In Rapperswil the street turns to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the curve, just above the house at the corner, I see something strange.  It is pink and seems to have dark, black shadows on itself.  The object appears fuzzy; I can’t recognize its shape clearly.  In the first moment I think the widget is about 10 meters in size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I pass the curve I turn around and spot the object in front of the corner house; it seems to be much smaller now.  And it seems to follow me on the left side.  Immediately it is vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole observation did not even take a minute and there was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> German:  Schweiz, 13. Juli 2012. Von Süden kommend fahre ich nach Rapperswil; der Seedamm führt über den Zürichsee in die Stadt. In Rapperswil macht die Straße eine scharfe Linkskurve.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dort, unmittelbar über dem Eckhaus in der Luft, sehe ich etwas Seltsames. Es ist rosarot und scheint in sich schwarze Schatten zu haben. Das Objekt ist nur sehr unscharf zu erkennen; seine Konturen sind verschwommen und kaum auszumachen. Zunächst denke ich, das Ding sei zirka 10 auf 10 Meter groß. Als ich mich nach der Kurve umsehe, mache ich es vor der Fassade des Eckhauses aus. Nun erscheint es mir deutlich kleiner. Und es scheint mich zu meiner Linken zu verfolgen. Doch plötzlich ist es verschwunden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meine Beobachtung hat nicht mal eine Minute gedauert und war völlig lautlos.<n>

I noticed an extremely bright light in the sky, illuminating like a star but extremely low on the horizon toward Keesler AFB in Biloxi, MS. The description matches the posting on this sight that occurred on 05/19/12.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I arrived home approximately 10 minutes after I first noticed the light.  It could still be observed in the sky. I watched it for approximately 20 minutes.  It did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife thought it might be a star but it was way too low on the horizon and seemed to generate its own light.  Extremely bright-the brightest thing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my location, with my arm extended I made a crude attempt to measure the object utilizing my thumb and index finger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was approximately a ½ inch from top to bottom. It has not been observed since.<n>

My Golden Retriever approach the area of &amp;quot;fly-up&amp;quot; very slowly, sniffing the aire and walking very slowly.   My German Shepherd at the same time was slowly approaching the area looking upwards and moving in a questioning manner. It was very dark outback, however I had flipped on the back lights, that lit up the yard for me watch the dogs from the porch.   And, I was on the porch frozen and quizzled as to what in the world I had just seen.  I have questioned different people about what this could possibly be.   A large owl, osprey were the answers.  I have bird watched quite a bit and know my silhouettes.   This shape does not match any bird descriptor I have referenced or observed.  There were no flapping wings or wing spread nor was there a tail visible.  I did find however, bird feathers of birds possibly consumed. It&#39;s the triangular shape that has me puzzled.  And, the power this thing had to have to leap to a higher branch or line.  I stayed on the porch frozen while my dogs continued to sniff and look upwards.  They finally gave up did their business and came in.  I could not sleep all thinking about what this thing could be.  When I question or tell other people about this experience I am laughed at or brushed off with a silly look or remark.  I know what I saw.  And, if the dogs could talk they would back me up!<n>

It was out of sight in less then a minute.<n>

Over several minutes it moved closer traveling East over the Gulf towards me, to the point it paused, drifted to the south then back north.   At that time, it paused and the red light seemed to shut down, but the silhouette remained against the evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed the object out to my daughters, a friend&#39;s daughter and a gentleman in the pool.  The silhouette drafted north and lower on the horizon behind the condo out of view.  It was out of sight for approximately 2 minutes, reappeared to the right, northside, of the condo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red light came back on and it quickly flew N-NW back out over the Gulf until I lost sight, another 2 minutes or so.  The red light appeared to be illuminating from the bottom of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the point it was stationary, a commercial jet flew very high behind and above the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was close enough for me to know that it is something I have never seen before.<n>

The three craft were moving from north to south.  They were closer than the next town over, which is about nine miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight path was about 45 degrees above the horizon, and the cylindrical object was about half the size of the full moon.  It looked liked it was being herded by the two craft following it, which looked to be military craft, with one flanking it on the left and another following behind.  It traveled in a straight line from north to south.  However, as it went further south, it started to jog to the south-southwest, and also changed shape to a whitish-red orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted 8 minutes, from 2236 to 2244.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I saw the object I turned around, and pulled off onto a side street, stopped the car and watched.<n>

I had gone out to pick up my son at work, when all of a sudden I was struck by the fact that there were strange lights in the sky which were reddish-orange and spherical in shape; and at approximately 20 meters altitude.  Attempting to count them, I ascertained there were 9.  The spheres were about a meter in diameter.  As I was trying to follow the spheres, gradually one of them disappeared completely.  One suddenly descended and I attempted to approach it in the car, hoping to get all on my cell phone as a short video; but before I could do so, the sphere approached me to within 5 meters at which point I was able to see distinctly that its shape was completely spherical with lights internally which, from up close, I was able to see were white, red, and orange.  My first impression was that they appeared to be little satellites  I was intent on running after it with the car, but after a brief period it disappeared.

The object traveled in a straight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the fireball passed overhead, I could hear the fire it omitted.  It sounded like a blow torch.  I couldn&#39;t hear it very well.

The white one was now in the lead slightly. It passed over in total silence.  Then the orange one passed overhead.  The glowing orange light seems to come from within.

Weather conditions were clear, no moonlight, starts could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking east, I saw a red ball of light with an orange colored center go straight up, to approximately 500 to 700 AGL.  The red and orange colors were blended.  The light did have a pulsing action, about one pulse per every second or two.  At first, I thought it was a firework, but there were no dissipating lights going outward as a firework would go off and dissipate.  This light had come towards me, approximately the same altitude, again 500 to 700 AGL, and was about ½ to 1 mile away.  The light slowed down, and whoever was flying it, had definite control over its course, speed, and altitude.  I thought for a minute, maybe it was an unmanned balloon, but a balloon would drift, and again, this had definite controlled movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued walking my dogs because they were now pulling me to come along, I pointed to my dog,! look up, but of course, they are dogs, whatever, lets go.  As I continued to move forward, this light gained altitude, about a 500 fpm climb, nothing drastic, and headed on its way south to south-westbound.  When I looked over my shoulder, it was on that course, about 3000 feet or so higher, on its merry way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes, I checked my phone for the time, which was 12:38am.  I was not scared, it was quite intriguing to me.  I specifically put in the pilot details, because that is what I am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hold an ATP certificate with 6600 hrs, and am a good judge of how high or fast an aircraft is going, or its direction, just like any other experienced pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found her to be an exceptionally good witness.

We stared at it for about 15 seconds trying to figure out what it was since we have no homes behind our little bit of woods.  All that’s behind them is a field of power lines that run for miles.  We were thinking maybe its an animal of some sort looking at us when all of the sudden we hear a very strange but loud noise coming from that area. We instantly in fear ran in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing I did was run to get my  flash light to shine in the back of my yard. It took me several seconds to grab it and go back outside.  As I shined it to the area where the light and noise was coming from.  We didn’t see anything so I figured what I saw needed no flashlight so I turned it off in hopes we could see the light when all of the sudden right behind the trees we were facing we saw these intense lights radiating through our tops of the tree line coming into a visible view for us to see.  It was a small craft with very bright red a white lights flashing around it in a circular motion.  This object was laying low right along our tree and power lines as it moved off out of our sight. There was no noise at all coming from it.  It just flew away in a sort of slow quiet motion.  It was flying so low that it could stay below the tree tops in the field we were facing where our view was limited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as it was out of our sight we ran down the road to look down the field in hopes we could still see it but it was gone. There was no time at all to even catch it on camera..  We were not expecting to see this since we originally thought it was something else in the woods and couldn’t believe my eyes. I’m 100% confident that I saw a UFO. The next day we went out to the area where we saw this strange light coming from and there is an imprint in the tall grass.  The grass is smashed down as if something was presse! d on it. This confirmed to me that what we saw in the sky was ! first si tting in my yard.  I’m frightened by this  and never in my life experienced anything like this.  I feel I needed to report this bizarre incident in fear this craft could come back.  Why was it in my back yard?  Creepy!<n>

College Educated. Buddhist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer 2: Electrical Engineer. College Educated. Atheist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 12th the &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; was bright just on the east of the horizon above the tree line at 5:10am.  Object was bright-white in the center and radiated a white light much like a LCD bulb -- radiated a brilliance, flickering.  Three smaller lights made an inverted triangle starting from the center of the object, descending. Smaller lights flashed Blue to Red.  The Object did not move for twenty minutes, used tree line, large pine and water tower as sight guides.  Object would waver towards the last 10 minutes, not sure if it was actually moving of eye fatigue.  To the right of the object was a smaller light, flashing red.  This object did move. Shot a 10 minute HD film. Both objects did not show up well on HD film -- propped the camera up on my sill.  Will be getting a tripod for the SLR/HD and trying again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 14th, Same light in the S.W. skies. Pattern of flashing lights very distinct.  Left - Red, Right - White, Bottom - Blue. Stationary for 1 hour.  Did see a satellite pass above/behind it; satellite was obscured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional:  I am just curious as to what I seeing.  I&#39;ve been seeing these my whole life.  They never make a sound, the are not aircraft and I am pretty sure they are not weather balloons, drones, or satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw similar object (though two this time), again, in February 2010 in the North over Stow, Ohio. In the 2010 sighting I saw what seemed to be objects being released from both lights.  As nuts as it sounds it almost looked like it was right out of &#34;Star Wars.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, several times in the 1990&#39;s over Attica, Indiana and Pine Village, Indiana.  And, in the late 1980&#39;s in River Falls, WI.  The RF light was so bright it filled the whole side window. It was May. Are there any astrological events that match that?  Morning star?  omething?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brother (Designer, Educated) also has seen similar from a young age.<n>

It was moving horizontally and appeared to be surrounded by sparks. It had a long tail at the end.  The sky was cloudy, so I&#39;m assuming it was travelling low in the sky beneath the clouds, otherwise I would&#39;nt have seen it.  My wife was talking to me in the backyard while I was looking up at the sky.  She was facing in the opposite direction, by the time she turned to look it was gone.<n>

This craft did not approach or descend toward the airport in any observable fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object turned swiftly to the west.  This object then turned a brilliant flame blue, then appeared to accelerate and ascend in a curve.  This object  was out of sight in three to four seconds upon becoming highly luminous.  It did not go over the horizon, but straight up.  This craft also seemed to leave a glowing trail that quickly disappaited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observer is mid twenties male, amatuer-physicist.

As the object moved it suddenly faded out to one fifteenth its starting brightness and then disappeared slightly right of the constellation Scorpius.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object did almost the exact same thing, appearing around Scorpius, bright and pulsing, then faded out in almost the exact location of the first object.  Both objects seemed very far away from Earth, and also seemed to move very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had very good visibility at the whole sky because there isn&#39;t much in the way of lights out on the back road areas of Stonington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To add even more drama to the whole event we witnessed approximately four shooting stars in the sky at the same time this event was going on and at different interv! als of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event lasted anywhere from two to four minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second night in a row that my friend saw this object, and it was in the same area, he states, that of the Scorpius Constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides little contact information.

In the distance were thunderstorms, which were flashing every 5-10 seconds.  As we were sitting there near the car (which we had turned off the headlights to), what appeared to be a craft came out of nowhere, about a half mile to a mile away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued on a course straight to our right, and made slight movements up and down until at a point, it ceased to move.  The object then turned, shining towards us two D-shaped lights, one D as is typed and the other turned on axis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object turned 270 degrees counterclockwise and commenced towards Pasco.  We were silent and heard no rotors.  There were lights which blinked on the craft, similar to a helicopter, yet no sound was made.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend speculated it to be an Apache helicopter, yet this seemed unlikely because of its movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later discovered that the area we were situated in was close to the area where! materials for and the atom bomb was created and tested.<n>

The Sphere was relatively low in the sky and was moving from East to West at a slow pace, the whole time the Sphere was flickering a little, but, at one point it flickered and got darker and smaller till it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my wife who said well it could be this or it must be that, but it is wierd. Then, we saw a second one approaching the same area we saw the first one disappear...this one did the same exact thing as the first, disappeared in the same spot.  The third one we saw was more to the West, by this time i had my old video camera out and caught the last one....also flying slow then flickering till it was there no longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was really happy to have caught that one on tape!! I have never experienced anything like that before and neither has my wife, we are both really amazed and maybe still in denial?  Though i am convinced what i saw was other worldly.<n>

I did not think of the word fireball until I viewed this website, but that pretty well describes what I saw.) It was moving from east to southwest about the speed of an airplane.  It looked like a commercial jetliner which was engulfed in flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The nighttime sky was cloudy and the object never became hidden by the clouds.  It seemed just inside the clouds and never was hidden by the clouds.  It was a bright orange and flared at the top just like a large object on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got almost out of sight, it seemed to “burn out.”  I saw it for about thirty seconds travel from one side of the sky to the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not noticeably change altitude and when it “burned out,” I could not tell if it burned out, went behind the clouds, or simply went out of view from distance.  It seemed to turn more of a white color for about five seconds before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole time I was watching it from my deck, I believed I was seeing a large airplane on fire.

There were fireworks in the area so initially I wasn&#39;t alarmed until I realized these 4 lights seemed to be moving in a formation, flew slowly, and were too high in the sky to be flares or fireworks.  At this point I ran in my house to grab my 2 girls who were still awake at the time, they are 12 and 14.  They too watched with me and tried to film them with our Iphones but there was too much surrounding light.  They diamond formation changed as this continued so it did not appear to 4 lights connected to 1 craft but rather 4 separate crafts or lights. after about 10 mins 1 fadded into the sky as if it were moving away from us, shortly later the other 3 did the same with 1 reappearing briefly.  There appeared to be a small plane flying directly toward the lights at one point and I would be certain they were seeing what we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the news the following morning and saw no reports until I googled it the following morning and saw this was not the 1st time similar lights like these have been spotted in the area.<n>

At first I thought that it was an airplane, but as it approached from the east I noticed that the lights weren’t blinking and there appeared to be only a very large reddish light. The object seemed to slow  considerably and then to rise straight up, as it did another identical object appeared lower on the horizon following the same general path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the first object fly straight up until it was no longer visible.  At this point I ran inside to get my husband. When we had both returned to the back yard, only about 15-20 seconds later we observed the second object getting closer, and then veering off to the north before it started its assent.  The second object did not go straight up. It had a more gradual assent, yet still at a very steep angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We at no time heard any noise that we thought could be coming from the objects, as you would hear from a helicopter or an airplane. We continued to watch the sky for another 15-20minutes but did not see any further sign of the objects. We did however see two airplanes which appeared farther away, and we could clearly see the blinking lights, and hear their engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are accustomed to air traffic as two major airports are less than 100km from our location, and we have never before seen anything that looks or maneuvers like the objects we just witnessed.<n>

It kept moving so I asked my husband, &#34;What is that?&#34;; and then we grabbed the bincolulars and went outside for a closer look.  I heard someone down the lake say, &#34;Could that be a plane?&#34; so I knew other people saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no moon and lots of clouds so we really couldn&#39;t make out the shape...just lots of red lights close together.  It made absolutely NO noise, and after about a minute, it turned and slowly started rising over the lake and then started moving much faster and then just faded away.<n>

It then went into the clouds and I only saw a blip of it a few minutes later, below where I&#39;d seen it last.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a satellite or the space station because it move as fast as I&#39;ve seen both of those but then I realized it was under the clouds and couldn&#39;t have been either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be above Bozeman but could have been slightly further east.<n>

Naturally my first thought was “that’s neat they are now using orange for the headlights of airplanes”; this was cool enough to alert my friend.  When the lights disappeared I believed the “airplane” to have passed behind some low clouds.  Momentarily the lights came back on, now both of us being witness to the event; we were awe struck by the new orange plane lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly three more sets of lights each identical to the first and parallel to the ocean, separated from the first set.  Now there are four sets of two lights each, each pair moving independently from the rest.  The sets of lights are identical to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly all four sets of lights disappeared at the exact same time leaving the night sky as pitch black as it was previously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon our return to the house to file this report and tell our friends about the siting we experienced some issues with our technological devices.  One of our phones went from a full battery to less than 25% and refused to charge in outlets that were working earlier today.  The other phone was also at full battery until I turned on the laptop at which point it went down to half and then back up to full.<n>

Not a star. The most amazing thing I ever saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning July 11 2012 1:00 am I was getting ready for bed and felt an urge to go out on my back porch for some fresh air. The sky was clear and stars and moon were out, for some reason I was compelled to look at a certain spot of the tree line, that&#39;s where I saw the light. At first I was sure it was a star, whitish in color. then it started to move up over the tree line, now I was sure it was an airplane it turned  a reddish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my amazement this thing what ever it is started moving in a way I have never seen anything in sky move before.  It would make sharp turns left right up down, but would stay in my view. It remind me of some one playing with a yo-yo in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching this thing dance in the sky for five or so minutes.  I ran  into the house got my phone and ran back outside.  I  called and woke up my dad (he lives nearby) watched this light for a few more minutes, dad shows up but the light slowly dipped back behind the tree line.  I&#39;m sure it was still there I just couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad left he didn&#39;t get to see it but I was so excited about what I just saw I couldn&#39;t go to sleep so I pulled up a lawn chair and watched the sky.  Around 1:30 am I thought the show was over.. this object (it could have been a meteor) flew across sky,  I never seen one so bright before. 2:00am another bright meteor or whatever it was flew the same path but backwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another strange thing, day time birds were up and making a lot of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched the web all morning trying to find some answer to what I saw.  To my surprise I saw an article on here from June 2012 south Charleston WV. I believe with all my being we saw the same object, they were  able to describe it better.<n>

I can’t believe what I just saw, I am flabbergasted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the west, over the Pacific, off the North Shore of O’ahu, Hawai’i:  I have skylights in my bedroom, and saw six or seven brilliant shapes of fire heading slowly south in a rough formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran downstairs and outside for a better look.  They made no sound.  One object actually went &#34;up&#34; a little and crossed the path of another.  They did seem to fade away at a fairly high altitude before they disappeared, but they were NOT flares or fireworks.  There was no smoke coming from them. They appeared to be about the distance a helicopter would fly, but it was difficult to determine.  They could have been much higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do have major military installations of all branches on the island, and I can only think it was some activity from them, but WHAT!!!!   They were very bright, orange flame-like and very large.  They do not seem like something meant to &#34;light a battlefield.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m sure many other people saw them.  I just couldn’t take my eyes off them, and did not have my phone handy, so no pictures. BOOOO!  I did write a quick note to one of the TV news websites.  What a mystery!<n>

Clear night and no clouds in site. I noticed a red light heading south from north east sky.  At first I thought a helicopter but not a plane.  The light was pulsating though. Not blinking.  Strange, I thought. I continued watching it head south (towards me) and the pulsating red light was bigger than before as it was getting closer.  After about a minute, it stopped and continued to pulsate and then changed direction slightly and started heading south west.  Now it was on my left side as I was watching it.  It&#39;s speed seemed consistent like it was in cruise control.  Towards the end of my siting, a sort of red pointy tail of light appeared on the main pulsating red light... it suddenly came again to a dead stop, pulsating and just blinked out.  Vanished.  All I could see were stars and dark sky.  It was strange and fascinating, indeed!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We stopped beside some cement granaries beside the railroad tracks.  I was gazing up at the Big Dipper constellation when I noticed apparent an airplane twin lights moving toward the Big Dipper bucket which went for some distance almost beneath the Dipper handle then disappeared.  Wondering what had happened to the plane lights I continued tracking farther toward the Big Dipper bucket when the light reappeared but as a single orange colored light.  I glanced at my wristwatch noting the time as 11:55 pm the resumed watching it.  Then it stopped, moved rapidly vertical a bit, then descended quickly and returned to the first position.  It bobbed about weirdly several times.  I pointed it out to my friend when the lights had disappeared the first time and we both watched it for about 15 minutes looking for possible explanations that might indicate what and how it might occur and decided to get going home.  It was still there when we left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are personally acquainted with the individual who submitted this report, and we consider him to be an exceptionally reliable, and qualified, observer.

The entire time it hovered perfectly still and had an infrequent pulse to accompany the glow.  At one point it appeared to have a light corona circling the very bright core.  It appeared to be far too high to be a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also ruled out a commercial airliner because of the lack of navigation lights as well as movement.  It was far too bright, orange, and far off that it could not be a search light or flare.  My wife thought that she might see something on Google Sky Map, but the light just abruptly disappeared before the app could even be opened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange indeed.<n>

It was traveling very fast at a slight downward slant towards the ground. I am 99.9% sure that it was not a shooting star. I have seen a shooting star before, once as a child and about 8 or 9 years ago as an adult.  They seem to disintegrate shortly after hitting the earths&#39; atmosphere.  This object did not fade at all as it flew behind the trees at a downward slant towards the ground.  I happened to have my windows and doors opened last night because it was exceptionally cool after the rain and happened to be looking at the sky when this object suddenly appeared, dashing across the sky.  This sighting only lasted about 2 or 3 seconds, but I am pretty sure of what it wasn&#39;t and have no idea what it was. It was a very bright white diamond shaped craft with a thick white, vapor trail that looked like a beam of light behind it. Difficult to say! how large it was. I was approximately 200 yards away from the object. I am a business professional, currently unemployed. I do have a degree in Business Administration and am over the age of 40 years old. I can tell you that this is not a hoax and I would not be wasting everyones time reporting this if I did not feel that this was a genuine sighting. I have studied UFOs for many years and this was like nothing I have ever seen before. I am near one of the largest military bases in the world and about 30 miles away from Gulf Breeze, FL. I told my roomate about it and he said that I should report it, so that if anyone else saw it in the general Fort Walton Beach area that would make it more credible. Keep watching the skies!!<n>

We watched this glowing orange ball climb higher in the sky going south for about 4-5 minutes and then it shot out of sight with in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t even begin to describe what it compares to other than a huge flying glowing orange sphere.  We did catch part of it on an IPhone video but there is no point of reference in the sky to gauge the size in the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never witnessed anything like this in my entire life.  It was definitely way larger than a helicopter and made no sound.  The orange glowing color seemed to rotate or orbit around the sphere. I have no words....<n>

For the past few weeks I have seen 3 fireballs in the sky. Every time I would see one it was always between 11:00-11:30pm. Keep in mind I&#39;m looking out my living room window for all these. The first one was a fireball right above our barn ,out the right side of window,and it sat there for about 5 seconds then it zoomed in the sky for about a foot then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second fireball was out the left side of our window. I was watching tv and seen a flickering that caught my eye. So I looked out the window and it went from a small dot to a fire ball for about 3 seconds then it zoomed in the sky ,again for about a foot, then disappeared. Each time these things zoom in the sky the fireball almost sparkles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third fireball was seen out the middle of our window. It was in the middle of the sky and the fireball flashed three times but moved in a downward diagonal for the three flashes then it was gone. It was about a total of ten seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of those sightings happened in about 2-3 weeks time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then last night 07/10/12 out of the right side of the window above the barn like the first fireball. I seen a sideways oval but all I seen was the outline of lights . It went from oval then to a squished oval then back to oval then it was gone. It never moved. It was in one spot then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I forgot to mention that the fireballs were all orange in color and that we live on 40 acres with my parents so I know that what I seen was not anyone&#39;s fault. And the oval thing I seen was not a firework because it had no noise and lasted about 7 seconds. Plus my dad would have had to light it in our driveway if it was a firework. He was sleeping at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope you seriously consider my story considering I have no proof. I&#39;m just concerned for my family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you<n>

Soon as I got off the exit I looked back and it was gone,  I spent the following half hour driving the roads around the area to see if I could see it anywhere, but saw nothing.  The time between me exiting off the interstate and turning around to see the object was about 30 seconds.<n>

It was still light out but not real bright sky. the lights then went out in an orderly fashion from left to right leaving nothing in the sky. no little black spots of aircraft or anything. I witnessed it myself and said &#34;what the hell was that?&#34; my friend eric who was driving the boat said &#34;oh i think thats a boat pretty far torwards shore&#34; i said &#34;no not that, there was some weird lights in the sky that just lit up and went out.&#34; everyone looked and they appeared again in a slightly different order or shape then went out one by one from left to right. we talked about it for a while and continued fishing till well after dark around 11:15! to 11:30 when out of the starry sky appeared a bright orange ball of light then quickly after about 5 more all at once, then going out from left to right and some other weird movements etc. then after about 15 seconds of seeing them the last one went out and a half mile or mile away to the north appeared them all instantly and faded out left to right. I grew up there and never have i seen anything like it. no sound, they appeared to be fairly close within 4 miles first time and later within a mile or so. very weird and startling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At on point my i phone turned off after the strange video interfererance it has on my recording devices.  It&#39;s like a celestial sphere with the light asbits core.

The color of the light changed randomly, including white, red, orange, and yellow.  At times I think I saw fainter lights shoot out from the main light that was bobbing around, but they were so faint that I&#39;m not positive.  Some of my thoughts while observing--&#34;That&#39;s a UFO. I&#39;m actually seeing a UFO.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that if this ever happened I&#39;d be a lot more scared. I&#39;m really glad that thing seems so far away.&amp;quot; I watched until the light dropped behind the trees across the street from my house. I considered getting in the car and driving to where I could get an unobstructed view but was too scared to do so by myself.<n>
7/10/12 00:00|Spring Grove|MN|Circle|5-7 seconds|Bright light over South East Minnesota.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90805.html|513|ndxe201207| Bright light over South East Minnesota.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From about 23:30 to about 1:30 on 7/9/12- 7/10/12, I witnessed a UFO.  The first sighting was around 23:30.  While stargazing, I saw a bright light.  At first I thought it was Venus.  I then realized that it was far too bright to be planet Venus.  As I studied it more closely, the craft got brighter and it accelerated from the northern sky towards the southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting took place around 0:15.  I was toying with my CB radio in my car.  For some reason, my radio could get outstanding reception.  I could listen to people as faraway as South Carolina and Oklahoma.  My car was facing west this time.  I saw the same craft.  As I studied it, the craft accelerated from the South Western sky to the Western sky.  I could only see it for 5-7 seconds.  The craft got brighter and it accelerated getting dimmer until I could only see its green lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could barely see the green lights.  The green lights only lasted for a few seconds.  There were five clusters of lights.  Each cluster had two lights.  There were four on the outside of the craft and one cluster in the center of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last sighting took place around 1:00.  It was the same event, a bright light gaining in intensity and then loosing its brightness as it was accelerating.  This was on the southern horizon.  I could not see any of the green lights that I saw before.  The third was too far on the horizon to witness what was happening beneath of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The times that I have listed in this report may be off.  The clock in my car was not working correctly and I did not think to check my phone.  My sightings took place in far South and East Minnesota.  I plan to write to my local newspaper.  I do not know if anyone else saw this event.<n>

They were certainly not Chinese Lanterns.  This theory has since been checked out via practical tests using Chinese Lanterns at similar time and weather conditions.  This theory was very quickly debunked.  As an example, if held at arm’s length the size of the &#39;fireballs&#39; were approximately the size of a golf ball.  Each object was noiseless, brightly illuminated by an intense orange/yellow glow and had a dark orange and red aura.  There were small black square shapes (assumed to be small windows) equally spaced around the top sections, underside there was a central &#39;slow pulsating&#39; red globe.  They moved steadily (in an unwavering boxed formation) against a South East wind.  Their actual speed and height was difficult to estimate and as an example they seemed to be moving slightly faster than a conventional civilian air! craft and any type of wind carried balloon or kite.  The night sky was cloudless, spotted with identifiable stars. Usual commercial air traffic moving to and from Malta was clearly distinguishable.  To the present similar objects continue to be seen in the night sky by locals and tourists alike.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

He slowed down to take this picture.  The blue lights on the bottom left are from a strip mall and a new led advertisement sign  on the side of the road.  You can see the taillights of a car ahead of him and the head lights of a car in the distance. This is not on a flight path.  This object was silent and low to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The skies were clear. I observed 4-5 (what I assumed to be) civilian aircrafts before the sighting, and 1 helicopter some time after the sighting.  I was on top of an apartment building stargazing when I noticed the object out of the corner of my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was fast moving and tannish-orange in color.  I observed no lights on the object in the short time I had a good view of it.  It&#39;s shape could be compared to a stubby boomerang with short wings. It wasn&#39;t following the flight path of any of the previously viewed aircrafts.  It was difficult to tell the height at which it was flying, but it was flying at a near immaculate pace.  I observed the object until it disappeared into the night sky, which leads me to believe the object could have possibly been reflecting the color/light from the city glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional observation: the object, while it had no visible light emitting portions, appeared to have translucent gem-like fixings.  But I diddnt get a good enough look to say for sure.<n>

A star/planet, I presumed, directly above my head (out of my line of sight) suddenly was very bright and I turned to look at it. It was brighter than any other star/planet I have ever seen after years of sky watching. It appeared to turn in place, and I thought for a second it must be a satellite. After about ten seconds it dimmed and began moving south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it began moving I immediately noticed another light that was about as far away as the width of the moon was moving with it. The two lights remained at the same distance throughout the rest of the sighting. At first they moved south for about twenty seconds, then turned and headed east. They then turned again and were moving to the north east until I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the encounter there was no sound. To the east of my location on the Gulf Coast there are active lightning storms and the flashing can sometimes be seen, but above my area the sky is completely clear and silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The things I saw could not have been stars or planets as they moved across the entire sky within two minutes. They could not have been satellites or other human objects in orbit because they did not maintain a straight course. They could not be planes as they were initially stationary, nor helicopters because they were above jet traffic – which is too high for helicopters to fly. All other ordinary explanations simply fail to account for what was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I know of your work and other Ufologists, I have seen you and others on TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting tonight was something that seemed so strange, I feel like I should share it with others and an expert in Ufology like yourself for I never have seen a UFO sighting.  This evening I was outside with a neighbor whittling wood for this is a hobby of ours and many like us.  I looked over to see my friend in a awe looking in the sky.  I was startled by his facial expression, it was as if he looking on the the destruction of Gomorrah.  I looked in the direction in the sky my friend was looking and there at the crest of the hill a cigar shaped craft, with strange holes (circle windows maybe, or lights?).  It was a few hundred yards in the air to my best guess, and about a half a mile away.  I turn my to see my neighbor was gone, he was sprinting to his home yelling to me he wanted to get his camera phone. I watched the craft as it descended further away and higher! in the sky.  Two minutes or so had passed my neighbor returned to only find that the craft disappeared to the heavens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to share this experience I had with people who will understand and not look upon me as a leper.  Lets face it the government wants us to adopt the idea that UFOs are fiction. We have been ravaged my lies and immorality.  Our government needs to understand that we the people know that UFOs are controlled by intelligent beings like us are more superior.  This craft that I saw was far more advanced than anything I have ever seen or read about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you Mr. Davenport for your work in Ufology, and thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I went into my kitchen thinking it was the old freezer &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; have that my domestic partner refuses to get rid of.  As I approached the kitchen, my sharp eyes caught something quite strange outside my bay window.  It is then I realized that it was not the old freezer making the noise, but rather something from outside.  Out of curiosity,  I went outside to see what was making the noise, and to my amazement, in the airspace above me, was a very large cigar shaped craft, metallic in color, with 5 to six small openings along the side where a dim light could be seen radiating out each individual one.  From estimation, based on the height of my roof top, the craft was anywhere from 500 to 700 ft in the air.  It was moving near the 95 interstate traveling south east. It was traveling at a somewhat slow speed and creating a humming noise which left me shaking in my boots.  I was frozen in shock for ! a couple of minutes just staring at it. It was then that I ran in my house to grab my filming camera we use for other things, but when I returned the craft had moved a great distance southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was left dumbfounded and confused.  I know what I saw and was a skeptic until tonight.  There is no way in this God forsaken place we call Earth, that no one else saw what I saw.  It was too big and traveling in an area (I-95) where thousands of people of all colors travel every minute of the day!  I would be EXTREMELY surprised if more reports about this craft do not start pouring in from the great state of Connecticut over the next few days. I will report this, if necessary to the highest of authorities in the state, not excluding, if need be, the leader of the United Nations. This how confused and disturbed I am about what I saw. Our government is manipulating us about the UFO subject and I will be damned if my domestic partner Harry and I do not speak up about this so people start ! putting pressure on Washington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport, you have a new supporte r and warrior in the fight for disclosure after what I witnessed tonight!  Thank you for your time and consideration of my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
7/9/12 22:15|Allen Park|MI|Sphere|20-30 seconds|I saw a round/spherical object move across the night sky at approximately 10-15000 ft altitude.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90857.html|522|ndxe201207| I saw a round/spherical object move across the night sky at approximately 10-15000 ft altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> July 9, 2012 between 10-10:30pm I was sitting at my patio table in our back yard in Allen Park, MI talking on my cell phone. There were a lot of big thick, white clouds in the sky that night and although I couldn’t see the moon it must have been out because the sky was fairly well illuminated.  I could easily see the well-defined edges of the clouds and the deep blue sky from outer space between them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While talking on the phone, my head was leaned back against the back of the chair and I was looking up at the sky.  All of a sudden movement in the sky caught my eye.  There was no noise to cause me to look for this approaching object, like you would do if you heard an approaching plane.  No noise at all.   It was hard to determine just what altitude it was flying at. My guess would be 10-15000 ft., since clouds range from 6500 to 18000 ft.   It was moving from SW to NW at about the same speed as a commercial jet would across the sky. If I’m remembering rightly, there was a large gap between clouds as it moved past me because it didn’t fly through any clouds except at the end of the 20-30 seconds I watched it.  As it moved across the sky I would guess it to have been a size comparable to if you held a penny out 18 inches from your face up toward the sky and closed one eye while looking up toward the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a perfectly round object.  I don’t believe it was round and flat like the proverbial flying saucer; it appeared to be spherical, like a round ball.  It appeared to have a slightly bluish color and also appeared to be glowing slightly or slightly illumined because when it went into the cloud, just before I lost sight of it, it looked like it was sort of glowing as it moved through the cloud; I was able to see it much longer because of the glow than I would have been able to see a plane that had gone into a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After losing sight of it, I was trying to describe what I had just seen to the person I was talking to on the phone, while at the same time looking around to see if any of my neighbors were out and may have seen it too.  There was no one else outside.  I was still looking all around in the sky, as if I would see something else.  Then about 5 minutes later I saw it again, still in the NW direction it had been moving when I lost sight of it.  This time it was further away than when I had last seen it and looked like it was traveling vertically moving toward the ground still the same speed as before, and still probably 10-15000 ft., just a guess though.  I would guess that it would have been located then somewhere in Dearborn near the Michigan Ave./Telegraph Rd. area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called our local channel 4 news the next day and asked if there were other reports of anyone seeing it.  The guy said no one else had called in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 53 years old and currently work in the telecommunications industry.  I have never seen anything like this before. It was very strange indeed.  I’ve heard about these government drones that supposedly fly around and collect info and/or spy on us.  Maybe it was one of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/9/12 22:00|Tiskilwa|IL|Triangle|~1 minute|My camp counselor, some cabin mates, and I saw a “black triangle UFO ”at night at summer camp in Illinois in 2012.|8/1/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/112/S112054.html|523|ndxe201207| My camp counselor, some cabin mates, and I saw a “black triangle UFO ”at night at summer camp in Illinois in 2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today&#39;s date:  31/7/2014<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date of sighting: around the second week of July, 2012<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: This occurred two years ago, so my memory of the event is a little spotty.  I apologize for the convenience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is ((name deleted)).  I am now fourteen years old and about to start my freshman year of high school, but at the time of the event, I was twelve and about to start seventh grade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was attending summer camp at Camp Menno Haven near Tiskilwa, Illinois, back in 2012.  It was Night Adventure Camp, so we had a slightly later curfew than the standard Trailblazer Camp.  It&#39;s a Mennonite camp, and is very outdoorsy (unlike me).  It&#39;s woody area, with a few clearings.  More information about the camp is available at &lt;mennohaven.com&gt;, but a warning, it&#39;s not the best designed website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I don&#39;t know the exact date, camp took place around the second week of July, and lasted five days. I have no idea which of the five days the event occurred on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My counselor (or maybe assistant counselor), several of my cabin mates, and I were headed back from campfire (it might not have been campfire, but I guess it&#39;s not very important) somewhere from 9–11 o&#39;clock at night. and going to our cabin, Hickory. We were on one of the big main paths that cut through the camp.  If I remember correctly, not all of Hickory Cabin was with us, as some were either still at campfire or already at the cabin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were just talking about something or other when we saw this weird craft we referred to as a plane.  It flew fairly low (significantly higher than a crop duster, but much, much lower than a commercial jet.  Think around twice the altitude of a crop duster, give or take) and was completely silent.  It moved in a straight line across the night sky.  The outline was somewhat difficult to make out in the dim light, but there was a very distinct pattern of lights on the bottom of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were four orange lights on the bottom of the craft, with three forming a triangle and one in the center.  This struck us as odd, and none of us had ever seen anything like it.  The craft moved at a moderate, fairly normal pace, and seemed to glide, as it moved very smoothly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passed out of view, our counselor/assistant counselor/whatever told us how he saw it at the previous camp the week before (I believe it was Trailblazer Camp), and his previous cabin thought it was weird as well.  We exchange various theories, and eventually our conversation turned to whether or not the Bible agrees with the thought of extraterrestrial life. We came to the consensus that surely there must be other life out there, and the Bible  doesn&#39;t seem to explicitly disagree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time passed, and after awhile the encounter faded to a distant memory.  Jump forward two years to about two weeks ago, and a new Matthew Santoro video came out.  I am subscribed to him on YouTube, and I enjoy watching his videos soon after they are posted. The video was “The 10 Most MYSTERIOUS UFO Sightings of All Time!”  Here&#39;s a link to the video:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://youtu.be/2Ifs0bPRIPk<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared on the YouTube widget on my Asus Google Nexus 7.  I taped the icon, and the video started.  At 5:45 in the video, I noticed something: the picture in the corner showing the triangular UFO sighting was eerily identical to the craft I had seen at camp two years before.  This led me to do a little research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reading several articles about these “black triangle UFOs”, I found that my sighting matched up perfectly with the other eyewitness reports and photos.  I decided to post my sighting here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone has any info they&#39;d like to share with me, or need me to try to remember more details, email me at ((e-address deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

My hobby is astronomy and I have watched the space station (ISS) travel across the sky in west to east fashion a number of times with my family but this object was moving from south to north and was not as bright as compared to the space station.  I had a clear view the entire time of about 20 seconds and it was moving about 3 times faster then the ISS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living out in the country, there are no street lights or city lights to mess with ones night vision and there was no moonlight or clouds out on this particular evening.  I could tell it was very high up and I did not notice any flashing lights or sounds from the object other than to say it was circular and a yellowish red in color.  It&#39;s elevation above the horizon was about 85 deg because I was almost looking straight up to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was talking to a co-worker of mine the next day and told him what I saw. I had just started the conversation when he asked me if it was about 10:45 to 11 pm and if was traveling south to north. I told him he was correct and he finished telling me that he and his wife were outside on their patio and saw the same object.  He lives about 12 miles from me and I was glad that I was actually not seeing things.  I was guessing that maybe it was a meteor skimming the atmosphere because it just seemed to disappear all at once.  I did not really notice though any streaks behind it such as a tail or fire coming from it so it is anyone&#39;s guess as to what it was.<n>

It was hovering for a little while and slowly made its way in the direction toward me, headed towards Chalfont.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I passed it slowly and got a really good look because it was moving real slow and was REALLY LOW. It was slowly traveling over CB West Highschool when I got a good look at it.  It was a DARK RECTANGLE, with like 8 white lights under it in two rows to make about 16 lights total.  There was like one red and one green light in the backside of the rectangle (underneath).   All I could keep saying was, &#34;What the fuck is that?  What the fuck is that?!?<n> <n><n> <n><n> AAAnndd of course my phone&#39;s broken so I couldn&#39;t call anyone, so I am just freaking out by myself.  I parked my car and got out to see it again but it was pretty far away at that point, and all I could see was a red light  then (I guess maybe its their brake lights haha).  But yea it was super weird and creepy and I HAD to post this SOMEWHERE because I can&#39;t stop thinking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that&#39;s that. I&#39;m hoping ET is friendly.<n>

The objects were flying very closely together at first and then starting splitting off - one group of two and a group of five.  There was no sound to be heard nor a trail.  At first my coworkers and I thought that it could be gliders, but, not only because of the altitude, the objects changed direction, this seemed unlikely.  They moved very smoothly through the air.  They would stop briefly and continue moving.  We could see them only barely with the naked eye, but through polarized sunglasses they were unmistakeable, white chevron shaped objects.  The hovered around back and forth for nearly five minutes before moving out of view to the east beyond the building we work in.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched it until I could no longer see it, which was about 5 minutes. It had been hovering around in the sky and made no noise. It descended some, moving to right, then left, and afterwards it started to ascend until it was no longer visible. It was a hot and cloudy/sunny day during the siting and in a quiet farm area.  The object seems to have a trim on the bottom and middle/top.<n>

The backyard faces north.  To the northeast I saw a green dot or orb between two trees. It was close to the horizon the sky was clear.  I thought it strange due to its color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was stationary for a bit before it moved erratically.  The movement was zig zagging up and down.  Very unlike any human made aircraft.  I thought maybe it was my contacts messing with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved around my backyard to get different points of view but it stayed up in the sky.  I then noticed an orange light that was stationary northeast of the green light.  The orange light was dimmer then the green light.   It had a beam of light attached to the green light. Both the orange light and beam of light faded out periodically.  Both lights were moving closer to the horizon and fading.  I assumed then that they were heading north.  I thought to call any of my friends that would be up.  My roommate works late and I called her she didn&#39;t answer.  I called my friend  and he was unfortunately drunk or high and didn&#39;t believe me.  During my phone call to my friend my roommate came home.  I hung up on my friend. Then  I ran out front to tell her to hurry the %Y## up and follow me to the backyard.  To which see saw the same thing I saw.  The green light continued to move erratically and fade from view.  I tried to convince my roommate to drive north to get a better view.  Unfortunately when we drove the city lights obscured any pin pointing of light.<n>

The second object then just simply dimmed out as it moved off to the north.  my wife says she saw the same object three days earlier a lot closer and lower.<n>

I went to the top floor (7th) of a near-by parking structure to use my binoculars to get a better look.  I was using low powered binoculars to observe Venus and Jupiter, which were approx. 30 degrees up from the eastern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I trained the binoculars on Venus, a dark colored object &#34;floated&#34; into my field of view.  The object was oblong to egg-shaped and seemed not to hold a steady form.  There were no visible lights emitting from the object.  The object appeared to hover in a stationary position before beginning to &amp;quot;drift&amp;quot; in a southern direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued south for approx. 2 minutes, then made a distinct and sudden turn west.  The object increased it&#39;s speed as it moved west for approx. 10 seconds, then continued to hover.  I lowered the binoculars to attempt to view it with my &amp;qu! ot;naked&amp;quot; eye, with negative results.  I re-engaged the binoculars and again saw the object in about the same position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lowered the binoculars again to try and find something to lean against to steady my view through the binoculars.  Approx. 20 seconds passed before I re-engaged the binoculars, but could not re-located the object.  I spent the next 10 minutes using the binoculars to scan the area in a &amp;quot;strip search&amp;quot; pattern to try and re-locate the object, with negative results.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was cloudless with a hint of marine layer haze, low on the horizon.  The object appeared to be at an altitude greater than 10,000ft., though I can&#39;t validate that without knowing it&#39;s size.  I did not see any light reflecting from the object, despite the approaching sunrise (it should have been high enough to have been above the earth&#39;s shadow).  It was dark colored, close to black, and seemed to absorb light.  I did not hear any sound I could associate with the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I pulled off to the road to observe these lights and i noticed they were not pulsating or blinking. they were just staying in place. it was during this time that i noticed they were in place directly below the 7 sisters consteleation.  After a short time i continued my drive home, observing these lights the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After arriving at home, my friend and i were still able to see the lights clearly and it was at this time, around 0300, that we both observed a pulsating red orb appear and it stayed in place to the bottom right of the lower white light. upon continued observation the red light started to change from red, to white, to blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to observe these lights for a couple more hours and they never moved, although occasionaly dimming out then getting bright again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived out in this area for 6 years, and am always aware of the sky, due to how clear a view we have. my friend has been here for 20 years.

July 09th))  @ 12am in West Olympia, WA, Washington had a lightning storm this evening.  The storm was in the north sky.   People were outside watching and socializing.  I took a moment to gaze myself in the front of my apartment.  I was doing laundry, and walked through the building to the back side to change the it over.  As I was walking, to the east a red light in the trees about 100ft away caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped in mid stride. I muttered, &#34;What the?&#34;  and within 3 to 5 seconds found myself running towards it.  It was about 200 ft in the air, slowly descending above a thicket of Evergreens, behind a row of houses, and next to a church.  It was luminous red, orb like and very bright.  I am having trouble gauging the diameter of the object.  It wasn&#39;t huge, but it wasn&#39;t small either. Maybe 10ft x 10ft? The center of the object shone very bright.  So bright I squinted my eyes.  This made me think it was a helicopter.  But the closer I got, it was apparent this was no helicopter.  Associated with this red glowing orb was no sound, no wind, no smoke, no sulfur smell. Just a bright glowing red orb in a slow controlled decent into the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not the only witness. When I ran out to the street, there were two cars parked and idling in the middle of the road. Their passengers, teenagers. They had spilled out onto the sidewalk and were staring in awe just as I was, &#34;Did you just see that?&#34;   I said, &#34;The red glowing light, yeah!  What was that?&#34;  said one of the males.  Neither of us knew.  But we agreed that there was no sound associated with the mysterious red orb in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had my phone in hand ready to capture video, but it had disappeared into the trees before I could film.  One of the teenagers said he captured it with his video camera.  I was so focused on it returning, that I failed to exchange information with him so I could see the video he took.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of minutes they all drove away, and I continued to stand there for another 15.  I stared at the trees hoping it would reappear.  I also listened for something to indicate a hoax; people partying in their back yards, laughter, music.  Anything to give logic to what we had seen.  There was nothing except quiet dark houses, white lightning and me alone in the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have knocked on the houses that the red orb descended behind, asking people if they were aware of what happened in the early hours of that morning.  One of the teenagers that was witness to the event lives in one of the houses and answered the door.  He says that it was a friend of a friend who took the video.  I left my name, email address and phone number hoping he will pass my information along.<n>

There were no clouds in the sky,  no wind blowing, a very quiet night, and no traffic noises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The stars in the sky could be seen very clearly.  The only lights that could be observed that night were from neighboring houses.   There were no street lights on any of the streets in surrounding neighborhoods.   The conditions were absolutely excellent for the UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I present this report, I need to detail the sighting location to establish the fact that there were no obstructions within the viewing area.  The only obstructions were at distant houses and the next door neighbor‘s house as the craft passed overhead.   Refer to the attached Google Earth map for a detail picture of the observation area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report was written by my father (an electrical engineer), with details added by my mother, and details added by myself.   The three adults who viewed the sighting, all agree to the report’s accuracy.  None of the observers had ever seen a physical UFO, alone one that flew over the next door neighbor’s house.   I am 41 years old, my father is 67 years old, and my mother is 66 years old.   I was a US Marine, am currently unemployed and currently going to college for a degree.  My father was an electrical engineer with Honeywell and is currently retired.   My mother has always worked in retail and is currently retired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the front porch of my parent’s house at 10:10 PM on the night of July 8th of 2012, which was a Sunday night.  It was a dark cloudless evening with absolutely no wind.  There was absolutely no noise or road traffic during the entire sighting.   I was smoking a cigarette and looked south above the houses across  from us, the next street over, seeing nothing strange.  I was seated on the front porch on this Sunday night at 10:10 PM.   I looked down, while smoking and then up again, noticing a bright orange light which was previously not present in the sky above the houses south, the next street over.   I observed the orange light for approximately 10 seconds, traveling in my direction.   I then called my son  to get my parents as well as my youngest son.   By the time everyone was outside, the object had crossed the street, to the south of us.  There were three adults present and my two children, age 7 and age 9.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a spherical round shape (like a basketball), as witnessed by those present.  The spherical object displayed a fluttering energy field of some kind that enveloped the bottom of the sphere.  I’m sure that the energy field was providing the possible antigravity field for the object.   The fluttering energy field provided the only illumination to the spherical object, which was an “extremely” bright orange light, illuminating the lower surface of the sphere.  The top portion of the sphere showed to be dark, probably because the energy field’s light emission could not reflect off  the top surface of the sphere.   There was though, a faint outline of the sphere at the top.   No windows, doors,  protrusions, or protruding appendages were observable on the craft.    Please note that the extreme intensity of the orange light at the bottom of the sphere could have obscured these features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO appeared to be traveling (estimated speed) 30-50 mph, or at a normal street driving speed while it was in the observation viewing window.   The viewing window time (while the object was being viewed) was an estimated 2 minutes in length.  The size of the object as it crossed over our street, which was about three houses up the road, showed to be the size of a penny as viewed at arms length.  The estimated altitude as it crossed over our street showed approximately a 45 degree angle into the air, showed to be approximately the length of a football field high.   There was absolutely no sound during the observation period.   At its closest point to us, it was dead silent.    The object had appeared to have gone in a straight line with no deviation in direction or altitude while being observed.    It disappeared over the houses on our side of the street.  My dad did go down the driveway and observed it continuing its journey to the north until it disappeared over the ho! uses behind us.   Airplanes can be ruled out due to its no noise heard, and hot air balloons can be ruled out due to there being absolutely no breeze or air currents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO flight path had probably crossed over the entire eastern edge of Prescott Valley heading due north.   During our observation period, it was traveling due north.   Interviewing neighbors up and down our street, no one saw the object because they were either in bed, preparing to go to bed, or were up with the blinds closed.   At 10:00 PM, one would have to be very lucky to have seen the object, especially when it made no noise.<n>

The glow of light traveled across the sky for a count of 5 seconds (we both agreed) and then disappeared.  The strange thing was we heard no noise.  If what we saw was a plane of some sort and traveled across the sky in the 5 seconds we have estimated we viewed the light, it would have had to be very low.  Not sure what we saw?<n>

It appeared almost like fire burning in the sky and when I called my wife into the room to view the object, she at first thought it might be a helicopter on fire.  We watched as the object continued north for approximately 1 minute and it then made a turn to the west and traveled that direction for approximately another minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 seconds into its flight toward the west, it changed from orange to white and afterward, the light dimmed-out.  The object was flying at low altitude; we are guessing at possibly at 3 or 4 thousand feet and we are certain that it was not an airplane or helicopter.  The color and brightness of the light was unlike what one would see from an airplane.  We also wondered about the possibility of a hot air passenger or weather baloon but with it maintaining the constant light and changing directions, we knew this would rule out this type of object.  Its flight seemed deliberate but its appearance was very unusual because it appeared to change shape as if its light was slightly dimming and then becoming brighter at times, as it was flying.<n>

Continuing east bound on Foothill Blvd, noticed multiple spheres in the sky towards the foothills at a high altitude.  Turned North bound on Town Avenue and pulled over. Several witnesses on Town avenue and at Chevron on Foothill cross street of Town. Lights appeared to be spherical. In groups of 2 and 3, these lights appeared to be moving slowly from West to East. Lights were orange/red and steady in color.  There did not appear to be a strobe effect or any aviation lights on these objects.  There was no audible sound associated with them. They would continue on and from my vantage point, appear to go straight up and disappear, or fade completely from sight. Periodically, one or two would begin to move south on Town avenue and appear to correct their &amp;quot;course&amp;quot; and re-join the other spheres. This continued on for the better part of! an hour. I personally counted at least 30 of these objects. A jet at one point did go over head at a  high altitude. Jet did not appear to be military.<n>

He then randomly pointed out a flash of red light quickly fading away, but I had the time to quickly take out my phone and take a picture (which came out terrible and you can barely see a thing :( ).  We could see an airplane nearby and there was quite a difference.  The UFO had a bright red light and was very fast, seeing that it faded away unbelievably quickly.  It was spotted in west Montreal.<n>

It disappeared into the sky 10 seconds after being sighted.  I had the time to take a picture (which came out terrible because of the quality of my phone).  We were just playing basketball on the street when my friend noticed it.  It went at quite a speed and didn&#39;t look anything like an airplane of any kind; it was much bigger for one, it was round and fast, and there was a red haze/light surrounding it.<n>

I have made the Deans list twice my first two semester and am a straight A student.  I am skeptical as to what UFO are and who pilots them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the sighting, we were getting of the Massachusetts Turnpike when my younger brother saw an orange light in the distance.  He pointed it out and me and my mother looked and saw it moving towards us fast. My brother said, &#34;it&#39;s a UFO,&#34; and insisted that we pull into a Walgreens&#39; parking lot to get out of our car and look at the object.  To our surprise, the object slowed once over us as if it wanted to be seen.  The object was like a ball of fire.  We could see the flames along the outside of the object.  I estimate the object was between 200 and 500 feet above us, (which I understand to be a rough estimate).  All I know is that it was low enough to see that it was on fire and flickering.  As it slowed and passed overhead, we watched the object Grow dimmer and dimmer until it&#39;s flame became a flicker, and it&#39;s flicker fade until the object disappeared.  That was the last we saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

First time sighting!|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90686.html|552|ndxe201207| 4 Orange lights seen over Oakland, CA - Interesting maneuvers and disappearance.  First time sighting!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving northwest on I-580 between Park blvd. and Lakeshore Ave.  While exiting onto Lakeshore, I saw 4 very bright orange lights in the sky to the west, heading southeast toward me.  My first reaction was that they were a string of planes on their way to land, which is a common sight in the bay area.  They were below the cloud cover, which is relatively low (touches the hilltops), but I couldn’t see any sort of shape to them.  A fourth that was hanging back abruptly caught up, bobbing ad looping as it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I had run through all the options.  Based on their speed, I am convinced they were “aircraft“, but  they were making turns and altitude changes that appeared unearthly.  They started to turn to the east rather quickly, at which point I couldn’t look anymore, considering I was driving.  After finding a parking spot, I ran out of the car and looked up, only to find one craft slowly moving west to east.  As it sat in the sky, I got a good look at it: Orange orb with yellow edges, no apparent solid shape.  It was larger than Jupiter in the night sky, but definitely smaller than the moon.  It jogged around for a second then seemed to go straight up, fading out through the cloud layers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw two men talking where I had stopped, and when they separated I pulled one over to look at what I was seeing.  He was somewhat interested, but figured it was a helicopter and walked back inside his home.  Well, after what I saw, I can safely rule out helicopters, airplanes, or anything inanimate like &amp;quot;Chinese lanterns&amp;quot;.  These things were moving all over the place in their flight path, and were at times going faster than the F-18&#39;s that were flying over for the 4th of July.  It was surreal to see the way they moved, it is difficult to put into words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never thought I would see something like this over my home town.<n>
7/8/12 21:00|Linden|NJ|Fireball|5 minutes|2 bright orange orbs in NJ sky|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90695.html|553|ndxe201207| 2 bright orange orbs in NJ sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> First saw one bright, firey orange orb traveling from the WSW and vanishing S. It was moving along kinda slowly at first, then it stopped and hovered in one place for about 30 seconds. It then dropped straight down rapidly.  Again, it stopped and hovered, then it took a left and then increased greatly in speed and vanished into the sky.  Less than a minute later, another fireball followed, exactly the same as the first (and from the same direction), however this one did not stop or make any movements. It just followed the same path and went to the south and disappeared into the night sky like the first.  I KNOW that the movements that first one made could NOT be done by any aircraft I am away of.  I also live close to a major US airport, so I know what their lights look like.  These were BRIGHT orange orbs that almost looked like debris falling out of orbit.  However, space junk doesn&#39;t stop and hover, and make movements that these did.  Amazing.<n>

Event duration 1 ~ 2 min. 4 reddish colored spheres in box formation; 1 witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “UFO Report”  What follows is an eye witness account of an unusual sighting as reported by my very lucid 78 year old mother who was driving on her way home from work in early July.  She was compelled to pull off on the shoulder of the interstate and stop to better witness this unusual sighting.  To my knowledge this is the first and only time in her 78 years that she has ever witnessed anything of this nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a 58 year old former aviator; retired USAF veteran of 20 years, with thousands of hours of flight time on both the C-130E and the KC-10A.  I have also accrued several thousand hours flight time on the commercial DC-10-40 under contract with Japan Airlines; I am now retired.  I questioned and cross examined the witness my mother extensively about the particulars of this sighting, asking her to write down the details for her family as I thought it was unusual and important; she did not get around to it so the task fell to me.  She is not prone to flights of fancy and is very much a reflection of the no-nonsense generation that suffered through the Great depression and WWII.  I only wish I had seen something this amazing and unusual just once in all my years of flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: July 8th or 9th 2012 during the evening hours at the onset of dusk; approximately 2000 ~ 2100 hrs local PST.  Sunset for Los Banos (a small town nearby) was listed as occurring at 2026 L on both days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: Approximately 7 miles past the town of Santa Nella, traveling north on interstate 5 (I-5).

Description of objects: 4 illuminated spheres, pale red in color and flying in a box or square formation as they traversed the interstate from east to west (right to left in witnesses field of vision).  They appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 300 feet elevation, and may have been about the size of grapefruits or as large as basketballs, as it was difficult to determine exactly.  They were silent and did not make any noise or sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four orbs or spheres continued crossing the interstate, leisurely headed in the direction of a residential farmhouse.  During this portion of their flight they changed position to resemble (in the words of the witness) a cigar-shape, with one red-sphere at each end and one on each side.  The witness tried desperately to ascertain if they were attached to a structure in any way, but could not make out anything solid or otherwise that would appear to connect them.  By now they were over the farmhouse and momentarily seemed to disappear behind it.  Next the witness noted that they (or it) just shot straight up into the sky at a very high rate of speed, further noting that if she had blinked she might have missed their departure thinking they (it) had just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WX:  Was clear with no clouds or obstructions to hamper line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other witnesses to her knowledge as the interstate was briefly deserted at this particular moment with no passing traffic; which may seem unusual but is certainly not impossible for brief periods of time at this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I don&#39;t know if you can use second hand reports, but I know you said on the radio that you would like all UFO&#39;s reported.  Use this report if you get any more from the West Valley City area.

We live in the Killian area of Miami and our best estimate is that the craft was near or above the Miami Zoo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our dog is very sick and throwing up and she went to open the door in front of our house so the dog can go to the bathroom.  When she looked up, in a south-westerly direction, she saw the craft at approximately a 45 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attached is a drawing of the craft made by my wife.  It was shaped like a cylinder but with pointed edges on both sides which appeared triangular shaped on each end.   The right and left sides, inside the triangle portion of the edges, had two large bands of extremely bright multi-colored lights on each side.  The middle part of the craft appeared very light whitish or grey colored.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft made an extremely loud noise, much more powerful than if an airplane was standing directly above us.  The object remained stationary for about 5 minutes and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have attached a drawing of the object, a map showing the location of our house and the location of the Miami zoo area, and a weather chart indicating that the visibility was 10 miles, and that there were scattered clouds at 3:30 am that night.  My wife said that she saw many stars in the sky that night and thus she had excellent visibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SUMMARY  	Previous to these events, my wife and I have never seen UFOS or other similar objects in our life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She is not bothered by this because she is very religious thinks that they were a messenger from God.  I, on the other hand, have been freaked out.  I started doing research on the subject, have joined MUFON, ordered about 30 UFO books, listen daily to Coast to Coast, etc, etc.  I never even knew that these radio programs or UFO organizations existed.   I am now consumed by the subject.  I need to find some answers and some closure because my wife says that I became obsessed with this issue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, I am an attorney with the IRS in Miami, FL and my wife was trained as a physical therapist and is a stay-at-home mom.  We live in a very nice upper middle class neighborhood in the Killian area of Miami, Florida.  We have lead normal dull lives until recently.<n>

I got home and woke my 16 year old niece and my wife, who then observed 8 more occurrences of the objects appearing from the northeast, moving rapidly until just beyond our location, then slowing in speed and moving until out of sight.  I had observed 8 total objects before waking my family.  I did get one of the objects on video, but realized as I was filming that a bright light in the night sky doesn&#39;t really provide context for what is actually taking place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were completely silent, orange in color, and appeared to be very close, as their relative observed size changed quickly as they got closer then further away.

See attached photos from late at night EST NW sky at my address.  Last time it was in another location above trees reason knew it was not moon is because moon will not be there that time and it moved in a way that defied logic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Looking North  Time: 11:40 PM PST  It was a perfectly clear and still Seattle nigh|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90864.html|563|ndxe201207| Location: On top of Magnolia in Seattle. Eyres Pl W.  Looking North  Time: 11:40 PM PST  It was a perfectly clear and still Seattle night without a cloud in the sky or a breeze and a very bright moon.  As I got out of my car I observed 6 reddish/orange fireball type orbs in a formation looking to the north from the top of Magnolia as I stood by my car on the sidewalk.  They were just above the tree elevation on the horizon of the sky at first.  They were solid reddish/orange lists and were not blinking. They were north of my location in Magnolia. The appeared to be in a formation with fairly equal spacing between them.  They were totally silent and appeared to be slowly moving south towards me from the north.  They appeared to be at 5000 feet or so and then they started elevating from there to the north of Magnolia. It was difficult to judge the exact elevation they were however.  It appeared to be about the same height that a low plane would be. When I first noticed them, at first I thought they were just the blinking red lights on the radio towers on the top of Queen Anne Hill as they were at about that height in the sky. I then looked to my east and observed the Queen Anne blinking red radio tower lights and quickly realized that these reddish/orange fireball orbs were something totally different than the Queen Anne radio tower lights as they were to the north and there are no radio towers to the north of my location on Magnolia. These orbs were different as they were not blinking and were a solid reddish/orange color and they were moving. I observed these orbs for approximately 10 mins as they slowly came north from the south and slowly elevated from their original elevation keeping in formation. One orb after the other elevated (one at a time)to a certain elevation point in the sky maybe 10,000 feet closer to my location than at first. When each one got to the same higher elevation point in the sky each one of them disappeared at about the same point in the sky (one by one) until they had all disappeared by 11:50 PM PST. They made ! no sound. Normally in Magnolia there is lots of plane air traf! fic that I observe from this vantage point of planes taking off and landing as they fly over the city of Seattle in approach for landing or after takeoff from SeaTac Airport to the south as this location I was at in Magnolia is right over the flight path to the SeaTac airport from the north. I made a point to look around in every direction while I was viewing the orbs looking for air traffic and there were no planes that I observed during this 10 minute sighting while the orbs were present. This was very strange as it is very normal to hear and see planes flying over this location in Magnolia all the time. I noticed that no sooner as soon as the last orb had disappeared above me that I saw and heard several airplanes fly over the area as was normal. It was as if the orbs saw the planes coming and disappeared just before they arrived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 43 year old Regional Manager for a HR Software Company. I have had three jobs in 20 years out of college. My mother has lived in Magnolia for 20 years and I stay with her frequently and no the area well and the air traffic patterns of planes in the area. These orbs were not planes or helicopters as they were solid lights, moved slow in a formation, and were totally silent. They were not flares either because flares come down and these orbs were going up and keeping in formation. I have never seen anything like them before.<n>

It was moving very fast and was extremely high in the sky.  We estimate it was at least 50 miles by 70 miles in size and moving several thousand miles an hour.  It traveled from the south east to northwest and when it got over the ocean, Manzanita is on the coast, it turned and went directly west until it disappeared. This lasted about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few moments later we observed an orange light out over the ocean, very high up, far to the south. It traveled slowly towards the east, then halted and remained stationary, after awhile it moved to the north very quickly.  At the distance, we estimated at least 100 miles away from us, the light had to be going from stationary to at least 2,000 miles an hour in quick bursts.  This lasted about 5 minutes.<n>

The evening was calm, cool and clear with just a little cloud cover in the sky. We were talking about the fun evening we just had  at my sister’s house when my girlfriend pointed to direct my attention to an object in the northwest sky that she was seeing..as we were looking at it my girlfriend was wondering out loud if it was a satellite or a piece of space debris burning up ..I was silent as I observed the object flying through the evening sky.  Both of us saw this bright red-orange light that was rather large (nickel size I think if one were to hold a coin up to block it from your view).  I remember not talking as I intensely observed the object..it was flying in a straight line probably 5-7 miles away several hundred feet up(airplane altitude) and traveling at a normal rate that a an airplane or helicopter might travel..and going from nort! herly  to a southerly direction.  I remember looking for running lights or flashing lights on a tail or wing of the craft –and I could find none.  I remember telling my girlfriend that I didn’t think it was a falling piece of space debris because the object was going in a straight direction from north to south and it wasn’t travelling fast enough to be falling from the sky..I also told her that I didn’t think it was a satellite because it was too low in the atmosphere.  The red-orange light made us think maybe it was a plane on fire..but we didn’t see any flickering flames at all..just a steady orange red light.  We observed the object until it got southwest of my girlfriend’s house and then it made a normal (not a sharp or a very gradual )turn to the west-southwest away from us..it was at this point that the red –orange light quickly flickered and vanished and the object became a pinpoint of light.still visible but barely, that accelerated at a very startling velocity away f! rom us. We could still see no flashing lights on a tail or win! gs of th e object even then.  The pinprick of light then vanished entirely in hazy cloud cover, darkness and distance.  I nor my girlfriend to this day have no idea what the thing could have been ..neither one of us have ever seen a ufo before and neither one of have the desire to see another one again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The fireworks were to the north of our deck toward the horizon.  My husband happened to look up directly above his head and saw a bright, red, round light. He called me to come see it.  I went to the door and looked up and saw the same thing.  We then called my 18 year old daughter and her friend who saw the same thing.  It was not a plane, nor a helicopter, and it made no sound that we could hear.  I thought maybe it could be a meteor, however, it zigzagged slightly, but stayed in the same general area and at about the same altitude. After a few minutes it appeared to get dimmer until it finally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were solid lights much brighter than any stars in the sky, and looked like a moving constellation.  There were approximately 15-18 lights that all traveled from north to south in the sky, maintaining perfect orientation to each other.  They moved from one horizon to the other in about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No Sound at all.

At first glance they appeared to be street lights, but I knew right away that based on the location of the lights the source was absolutely something aerial as they were far too high in the air, and too far from any road to be street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw another set of lights fly over Holman road, from north to south, as I pulled into the parking lot of the store. I immediately parked my car and got out to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I realized that there were at least 10 of these lights, in no particular formation, flying southward into the night sky.  They did not appear to be ascending or descending. One of them hovered momentarily above me, long enough for me to attempt to get my phone out. Of course, my phone battery was completely drained of battery life.  Instead I gazed at this thing, taking mental notes of it’s dark orange center that blended in a gradient to a dark red around the circumference.  It appeared to have some kind of texture on the orange portion that is hard to pinpoint or describe in a way that does it justice.... it almost looked like it was organic, for lack of a better term. Like the surface of the sun almost. It just appeared to have some kind of motion and energy to it. It was fuzzy, like I just couldn’t quite make out fine details on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, a fellow witness drove up toward me in a late model camaro (or possibly trans-am / firebird / i-roc - early to mid 80’s model in great condition) and stopped her car. She asked me excitedly if I could see them too. I informed her I could of course, and she got out of her car to watch them with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She got out of her car just in time to see the last one disappear from site. It was not clear whether these myseterious lights faded out due to distance or due to their light source slowly being extinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I could compare these to would be Chinese lanterns, but that doesn’t feel right.  They were, at least from my perspective, too large to be Chinese lanterns, and too perfectly round. Plus the lighting was so perfect....almost unreal.  It was so even over the surface of the sphere it almost looked matte.  The lights were not extremely bright, they were actually quite dull, as if they were just bright enough to illuminate the body of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say they were definitely NOT fireworks of any kind, as they were visible far too long and moved way too slowly.  I can say they were not standard aircraft because they did not make any audible sound and did not have the standard FAA required lights flashing anywhere on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s it.  They disappeared and I’m in awe.<n>

I stopped my truck and got out to listen and see if they were helicopters or airplanes there were no sounds at all.  The two orange lights stopped and hovered for a while then the red light faded very quickly back toward the two orange lights and they all moved very quickly up into the sky the red turned to brite orange and the two orange faded to light orange then turned white and all three were in a triangular formation high in the sky and appeared to be just stars.  I don&#39;t know what I saw but they were not airplanes or helicopters.  The red light when above the tree line seemed to have an intense center energy emanating the deep red light and the outside of the light had a white static electricity like halo around it.<n>

We were up there for about 20 minutes when I then saw an orange orb come out from a building.  The Orb flew out horizontally and then switched to fly completely vertically. It then proceeded to plain out again and slowly gain altitude into the clouds.  The sighting lasted around 30seconds. It seemed to be no more than a mile away to me.  This whole ordeal happened around very heavy and dark storm clouds.  I would have loved to get a video of the sighting but my phone isn&#39;t exactly new age.   Apparently the phenomenon has been happening around Regina for the last month and a half.  Hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report suggests that the alleged sighting occurred in both Saskatchewan and British Columbia.

They swirled within its own area in somewhat circular patterns very swiftly, then swooped towards the center, at which point it started over again.  They did this while rotating positions.  Normal reasoning would say search lights but this was far too high in the sky, far too spread out and again, you could tell they were above the clouds.  In addition, they moved much too fast to be search lights.

The “lights” had circular shape in a yellow/gold color, coming from the Lake Union area, down, from the horizon, going up, and travelling from East to South.  I took some binoculars and it seemed that the yellow/gold circle had a red center.  We are not sure what this was, because it was unlike anything else we have seen before.  If they were fireworks, they should have gone up, faster, but these were travelling in the sky, in pairs, it seems, and there were about 16. It took them about 5-10 minutes to go from one place to the other, and then they vanished.  We cannot remember exactly the time; I would assume it was around 22:00 I saw a plane nearby, but the shape of these objects was definitely different.<n>

We seen a round shaped flying object traveling in the direction of 282 degrees.   It was dead silent, big dark red in color and it slightly changed colors to a lighter red almost orange as it traveled.  It was going too fast to be a plane and too slow to be a meteorite.  We captured it on video as it traveled silently.   We are very curious to know what it was.<n>

I got out of the car and filmed some of the event with my phone&#39;s camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as it lazily moved across the sky, in a slow arc from low on the southwest horizon  in a northerly direction towards the center of the sky.  It slowed down and seemed to stop moving as it approached the center of the sky, at least from our perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought maybe it was a satellite, like the International Space Station (due to its brightness). Having seen the ISS on several occations, I can say it was similar in apparent size and brightness, although the object we saw was definitely not the ISS.  It was too slow, it moved in a curve, it was a fiery orange color, and it was flickering like a bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it started to dim, another one appeared where the first had started.  The first one faded, then brightened for an instant, then disappeared.  The other one followed suit, fading, brightening, then disappearing. It seemed to follow the same flight path as the first.  No other obects were sighted.<n>

We saw 4 lights in the sky.  There was a distinct cloud cover in the area, and these glowing lights were all visible beneath the clouds.  We slowed our car down and heard the beep of a tractor in a field, later I went back to meet that farmer and he was beeping at us to see the lights.  We talked about it and confirmed that it was like nothing that we had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we noticed the lights  I slowed the car down, head kind of out the window, and finally pulled over and stopped and got out of the car.  My partner watched from inside the car.  I could hear no sounds coming from those lights, only the small din of the tractor in the field we had just passed.  He later told me he had turned his tractor off and could hear nothing as well.  We saw 4 lights. One was blocked from view by trees by the time we pulled our car over.  It was difficult to tell about their movement.  They more or less were hovering, and moved a little and disappeared.  We assumed they went above the clouds but who knows.  When we did see the lights, they appeared bigger than airplane lights would in the sky, I would say they glowed, no flashing.  Their color was kind of a red-orange.  They immediately caught my attention as being a sight I had had never seen in the evening sky, and they were below the clouds.  When the three that we could finally see disappeared, th! ey did not disappear over the horizon, rather it appeared that they went into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went back to the farmer and he was putting his tractor away as it was pretty dark by now, not completely.  He was a Mennonite farmer.  He had been beeping at us to see the lights and we talked about it.  He said he had noticed them about the same time as we drove by.  I would guess that from the time we saw them to the time they disappeared that about two minutes went by.  He mentioned a diamond formation.  It appeared to us that the 4th was a little removed from the other three and then that was blocked from view as I stated earlier.<n>

She looked up and saw three bright orange lights rising into the sky from the southeast, in the same pattern.  They looked like they were on fire, then burned out, and then fell.  She called her three roommates to look outside and they saw five more of these &#39;fireballs&#39; rise, go out, and fall, following in the same approximate pattern.  The fireballs were slightly larger than a star, and moving much quicker than an airplane in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers are all female, early 20&#39;s, recent college graduates.<n>

I saw 7 or eight orange orbs in the distance all moving west to east at an airplane speed.  The sizes were all the same, about the size of a larger venus to a naked eye.  They were in some sort of formation and remained in this order.  One more came up from the rear to join the others.  I ran back inside and told my very level headed wife to get out here quick, which she did.  We both watched them as they all moved east and then eventually flickered out about mid &amp;quot;east/west&amp;quot;. I can read online that I&#39;m not alone in seeing these orange ones.  I&#39;ve never heard of this color of &amp;quot;UFO&amp;quot; before and was surprised to discover it&#39;s quite common lately. I know there are &amp;quot;worlds without end&amp;quot; that populate our universe as it&#39;s nuttier to believe anything else, especially since the Hubble Telescope let u! s take a peek, however, I believe they are all populated with humans just like us.  So I&#39;m thinking these orbs I saw last night are simply man made &amp;quot;somethings&amp;quot;.  End of report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I immediately called to my boyfriend who was inside on the couch watching TV.  He came outside and I pointed at the object and said &amp;quot;What is that?&amp;quot;.  We both looked at it for a few minutes until we could no longer see it.  The object was an orb shape and it appeared to have a rotating light or light and dark sides that were rotating.  The object was moving quickly across the sky.  This occured as a large thunderstorm was on the horizon.  We are not UFO folks, but this object was really creepy.  Not sure what it was, but it was moving very fast.  There were also several commercial aircraft in the area which we could use to gauge the size of the object. It was probably about the size of a tail (stabilizer fin) of a standard boeing aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The second set of lights did the same thing.  The top light was very bright.  I called my sons out and they watched them also.  I regret not grabbing my camera.  There were a few small lights shooting across the sky away from the lights.  Those maybe satelites.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The concert ended shortly before midnight and we started our way back home.  Nothing unusual happened most of the way until we reached the last border check point about 20 or so miles east of El Centro.  The odd thing about it was that there was no one stationed at the checkpoint, I slowed down then just drove away since no one was around it.  The vehicle behind me stayed. 5-10 miles passed it I ended up being pulled over by California Border Patrol (Very common government force in the area for obvious reasons) as a normal routine.  Nothing out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about a few more miles in a slightly vehicle populated freeway.  I noticed something what looked like a plane was going to land in the distance because it had a slowly flashing red and white light.  I  was a little surprised considering there was no airports for over 40 miles.  What happened next, blew me away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It turned on two front light sources, like a standard car and followed the path of a small bridge we were going to pass under.  It&#39;s common that roads go over highways so a small bridge is formed.  I thought at first it was just a car and the plane probably went behind it and out of view.  However, this was not the case.  Whatever was flying the craft, imitated a vehicle on the road.  I turned into disbelief as soon as I saw the &amp;quot;headlight&amp;quot; that was at the front of the craft started to roll leftwards and rightwards in about 60 degree angles at fast paces.  it went passed the bridge and flew over the small pasture. I pointed it out to my sleepy friends and noticed a small faint light was glowing in and out.  It honestly looked like it fainted into the sky but it then turned around and started flying low, headlights turned back on and it was literally 2 feet off the ground.  I was traveling 80mph and this thing accelerated real fast.  For a moment there, it looked like we wer! e both going to collide.  Before it hit the freeway it turned its headlights off(headlights kind of dimmed out) and flew up and over the freeway. Saw the red and white light underneath it. As it was flying away I noticed a small hole at the back of it that looked yellow, similar to a jet engine but probably no bigger than a steering wheel. It was about the length of a car, gray, no taller than 3 feet, elongated. Then I drove under the bridge, trying to keep an eye on it. Literally right after the bridge there was a bright light to the right of us that shined on us for a split second like a camera flash.  The vehicle did not make any noise at all.<n>

I suddenly saw two bright, unusual lights in the sky to the South, but above the clouds.  One was an oval and it was to the right, while the other was more &#34;Phoenix} shaped.  They hovered and appeared to be extremely high in the atmosphere.  Suddenly, a third light appeared above the other two, and within 30 seconds, there were bright flashes between the 3 &amp;quot;lights.&amp;quot;  The lights were visible in a triangular pattern and the lower two appeared to be stricken/hit/disabled.  The upper light disappeared instantly after the &#34;firefight&#34; while the Phoenix shape seemed to disintegrate rapidly and the sphere slowly faded.  I have witnessed several other &amp;quot;strange&amp;quot; events in the sky, but felt like I was watching a Stargate episode play out in my back yard.<n>

It looked to have gone about 600 ft if I measured it with the trees, but I felt it was much further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fell silent upon seeing it, tears fled my eyes, my face became incredibly flushed, it felt as if a wave of strange sensation fell upon my face, goose bumps developed, all of this happened within the 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately tried to call my boyfriend, but my phone wouldn&#39;t send out calls until I restarted it.<n>

It was moving from south to north very slowly.  I looked for flashing lights that planes would have but none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over so i could get a better stare at it and as I rolled down my window to look it had dimmed and dissapeared.

This light was brighter then any other light in the sky at the time even the moon.  I watched for about 10 to 15 seconds to see if I could see any blinking lights like a aircraft would have.  During that time I observed it moving at a slow pace from south to north while dimming in brightness.  As I had to look down at the ground as I was walking to another position because of a bad ankle all of a second when I looked back at the same area it was gone.  I would say it was at a very high altitude traveling a little slower then a plane would travel as far as the dimming it was very bright when I first saw it then by the last time I saw it, it had dimmed to about as bright as a normal star in the city lights.  It  seems as if the dimming coincided maybe with the fact that it was gaining elevation now that I think about it as it did also get smaller.<n>

This sighting took place due south of Kingston, Ontario Canada.  It lasted 5-seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I asked several potential witnesses standing in close proximity to me if they had seen the object, they said they had not as they were chatting.  I also suspect some of the group would have had their view blocked by an overhanging canopy from the entrance of the commercial establishment.  I was sitting on a knee wall at the outer perimeter of the canopy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, while descending, went from a starlight intensity (over the course of a second or so) to extremely bright (for 3 seconds or so) then back to its original intensity and blinked out. This occurred as the object arced through a half circle pattern away from my location, and seemingly on a 45 degree angle downward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best I can describe the object would be several times larger than Venus and many times its brightness.  I failed to call out to anyone in close proximity to me simply because I was utterly spellbound by the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky, where the object appeared, was cloudless.  I could see several stars behind where the light had been once it blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance south to Lake Ontario from my location has since been calculated to be a mile. The object appeared at a 1 O&#39;clock position (about 70 degrees) from my point of observation. I believe the object was midpoint between myself and the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I slowed down and turned off my headlights to get a better view and before I knew it my car was directly underneath the lights.  They seemed to be more independent moving than of a single object. I spooled myself fairly quickly and drove away looking back over my shoulder to see if I was in fact putting distance between myself and the lights.  While looking back I thought I saw a fourth independent light in the horizon.  They were all noiseless (at least from the car) and low enough to the ground that I lost them from my sight when enough trees were in the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/6/12 23:00|Newport|NC|Circle|around a minute|Two separate sightings over a few hours of multiple red orbs over the eastern carolina coast.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90757.html|615|ndxe201207| Two separate sightings over a few hours of multiple red orbs over the eastern carolina coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two friends and I were using a small boat to cross the sound between Emerald Island and the mainland to camp on a small island over night. We set out right near sunset, and arrived on the island right as it was getting dark. We were located on the unnamed island just north east of Lovett Island on the southernmost shore. We started to set up camp in a hurry, as it was getting dark fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were setting up the tent, my two friends started to look up at the sky and told me to do so. Over the main land, what seemed to be quite some distance away, was a glowing red orb slowly moving through the sky. It looked as if it was passing the auxiliary landing field for the local military base from the North, heading northeast. It looked as if it may have been traveling at the same speed as a helicopter, but we could hear no noise. It continued moving down the inland shore until we could no longer see it in the distance. We discussed what it may have been, but could not come to a conclusion. We haven’t seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few hours later is when an even more astounding sighting occurred after we set up camp and settled in. About two hours after settling in we ingested 25i-nbome, a legal hallucinogen. I know this might diminish the credibility of my witness for the following sighting, but I wish to report it either way. Might I also add that I could tell a difference between what was real and what was a hallucination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were now sitting on a blanket looking at the stars facing south, southeast. One of my friends was in the tent having an argument on the phone. My friend again, with a surprised voice told me to look up. We both saw the same thing. There were three glowing red orbs, just like the one from earlier, heading in the same direction, this time over Emerald Island. Again, they were heading northeast towards Morehead city. From our perspective they were in the shape of a triangle with one UFO in front and the other two following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They kept this formation for around 40 seconds before the lead UFO broke off ahead of the others. Its glow began to dim before finally disappearing.  The other two were still bright and slowly moving down the coast. One orb seemed to drop three smaller colored orbs out of its bottom which fell quickly to the ground. This detail, however, I am unsure of because of its similarity to a hallucination. The three UFOs were very clear however.Suddenly a fourth red orb appeared coming from the ground (or ocean on the other side of the island). It rose in an arc shape before reaching the altitude of the other two. They moved in small increments with the trailing craft mimicking the same movement from behind as if it were being tugged by the leading two craft.  They moved down the coast like this as well before fading out of sight. Again the only detail that I believe may have been a hallucination was the orbs falling from one of the UFOs to the ground. Our third friend did not witness! this sighting because he refused to leave the tent. After this, the night was relatively calm with no more activity.<n>

Saw several satellite’s and meteors.  Turned around to the SE toward Lewisburg, WV and saw 3, then 5 yellow-orange objects  rise on the horizon an hover.   At first thought 3 planets were rising in the night sky close together until all moved independent of each other, but still gravitated toward a one in particular.  Two on left moved off and dimmed.   One then reappeared and moved at vertical angles until above center object.  Triangular  in shape with three visible points of light.  Each of same size.  One on top and top on bottom.  Called for my wife who came out and also clearly observed.  When objects dimmed it seemed at first they were lowering the level of light from each and turning off.  Then it donned on us they were actually moving off initially at very slow speed and then such speed as to disappear.  Others would hover and slowly float around in the same general spot or barely move.  ! Then speed up and turn at sharp 45* angles with no visible arc.  No sound detectable.  No pulsing.  All disappeared.  We got into our truck and started to drive to next door hayfield.  Two reappeared in same location.  One left and the other stayed visible for several more minutes.  Seemed to be the one others had gravitated towards.  Then it move slowly in a linear manner, made a 45* angle to the left and poof was gone…<n>

They seemed to be a great distance away from me but were very vivid lights that did not flash or change color, only size and intensity.  As the lights gained altitude, they slowly diminished in size.  Their color was a bright orange-yellow.  My wife and her mother also witnessed the lights.  The strangest thing was that these lights appeared to be moving in a straight line, one behind the other, and they were evenly spaced!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as a total of 5 lights appeared and slowly faded out of sight.

At this time we all witnessed a solo fireball, at approximately 5000 feet in the air flying rather slowly over CT Route 34 heading eastwards towards CT Route 8.  This flight seemed to last for about a minute before disappearing into cloud cover.  Approximately 3 minutes later we then witnessed five more fireball looking object flying in the same direction as the first object did.  This time the first three objects flew in a triangle shaped formation while the last two flew side by side.  This time we could see the first formation slow down and speed up, while the second formation mimicked the first group as if it was avoiding crashing into it.  This slowing down and speeding up happened at least five times as the flight of these two formations seemed to take approximately five minutes.  These two formations then disappeared into the cloud cover as did the first solo object.  My best friend then left our location at 21:30 and he went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 22:03, my brother and I were heading back to our vehicle when we witnessed a solo fireball object flying in the same direction as the first six fireball objects.  After watching the flight for a minute we backed up our vehicle and left the dam.<n>

It had come from the south and moved toward north.  We talked about what it was or could be.  A few minutes later, another one came from the same direction.  It only showed for a few seconds then it just completely disappeared. Both looked to be about a mile high. Just a bright red orange ball as it moved.  Like a fire ball.<n>

There was no noise at all. They were moving pretty fast when they came across the tree line, heading east from Winston-Salem, right towards us.  They slowed down as the came across the field.  Then they changed direction completely, sped up, and headed north until we couldn’t see them anymore.  Then another, third one, came in almost the same pattern, finally heading off to the north.  It looked like it was 1500 ft off the ground and moved parallel to the ground until it headed off to the north which it started gaining elevation and speed.  The light from it looked kind of like an orange flare.  There was no smoke or trail though. I would estimate that it travelled several miles before we lost sight of it.  We have never seen anything like it.<n>

Truro MA.,  walking to our car in the direction of Provincetown, MA..  Directly up 6A there arose a round orange object that at first looked like a fireball, but with twinkling around the edges.  When the first one rose and then stopped in the air, we thought it was a firework that was about to explode into color.  Instead it stayed there for a few seconds and another one came up behind it.  We still thought it was 2 fireworks (although we had never seen fireworks like that).  The 2 held still for several seconds and then 5 more came up as a group.  When they did the 2 in the lead began to move, flying higher but in our direction.  The 5 followed and once they were overhead (although much higher now), they one by one rose quickly out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a red aura around it and it also had orange rays coming out of it all around the ball.  I was extremely bright. I know it was not an airplane.  It didn&#39;t blink, it made no sound and it glowed.   As I was watching it, it continued to go to the South.  It descended  a little bit, and then it was somewhat obstructed by a large tree that is in front of my apartment.  I could still see it, but I had to stretch to.  It then made an upward, gentle turn to the left and I then couldn&#39;t see it any longer.  The whole event lasted about 2-minutes.  It was unbelievable.

Thought it was a plane.  Sixty seconds passed and another light appeared.  Seemed to be following first light.  Still, could not identify blinking light usually found on plane.  All of a sudden, three white lights appeared.  They were flying in a triangle formation.  I knew this was not a commercial plane nor private pilots.  They all disappeared to the south.  The next day I was in a town called Fish Creek.  I was speaking to my step-son about what we saw and a lady said she saw fireballs in the sky the previous night in Fish Creek.  These objects made no noise not any identifying blinking lights as found on planes.  They all travelled at a steady pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My 1st impressions were of helicopters on maneuvers from Fort Drum.   Coming on a straight course as if they had left the nuclear power plant at Oswego &amp; were heading for our house.  (We are about 3 miles inland of the East Shore of Lake Ontario, Between Pulaski and Sandy Creek, NY)   They were in a straight line and we went out to see and hear better.  (I grabbed my camera too.)   There was never any sound.  Almost directly overhead they made a sharp right turn and headed South one at a time.   Just as they turned each in less than a minute became a dim white line and immediately disappeared.   This process took about 20-25 minutes total from sighting to disappearing.  Does anyone have any Idea what they were?  Pictures did not take in this box.. (all sitings perfect circles only one picture was circular)   As we watched they all looked like perfect spheres until turning.  I cannot explain those pictures that are not.  The pictures are in order of when taken.  Those you may think were the camera moving, show stars when in full size that are sharp &amp; not even elongated.<n>

I went to grab my i phone to take pictures when i noticed these lights had stopped and had infact gone brighter green, red, white and electric blue where these colors.  When returning from getting my i phone we noticed a large cigar shaped object had formed in the sky replacing one of the white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After taking various photos we herd a strange high pitched noise and noticed the objects where moving again in formation.  The cigar shaped object appered to have somehow formed three seperate lights and went smaller in size while changing color to pink.  At this time we had noticed an airplane in  mid air  in the other direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We found it quite difficult to take photos, up load them, and to concentrate...<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects seemed to VANISH in a blink of an eye, one by one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this morning the moon was still up and almost full as it was lighting up the sky all night.

I work in Wichita, Ks and I was on my way to work this morning 7-5-12 at 4:30 AM. I was at the intersection on Haver hill and Central this morning in El dorado at 4:30 AM with my turn signal on, waiting to turn West on 254 on my way to work in Wichita. As I was sitting there an Orange ORB appeared about a 45 degree angle out in front of me in the sky. It appeared to be less than a mile in the air. This was an orange orb which appeared to have an odd looking aurora or energy field surrounding the orb. There also appeared to be some kind of structure in the orb but I could not make it out. The orb was glowing and appeared to be pulsating and was very bright. As I sat at the turn light the orb was moving to the North East very slow, I decided to follow it. I followed the orb about 1 mile as it seem to be just glowing and appeared to be moving slowly. As I followed the orb, the orb appeared to slow down and I pulled over. I turned off my car and noticed! there was no sound at all in the air, also there was no blinking light what so ever on the orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to flicker my headlights from dim to bright many times at the orb while I was parked there. The orb all of a sudden changed colors from orange to white and appeared to just stop. It appeared to be checking me out for approx 30 seconds. Then the now white light started to get real small and then smaller then just faded away instantly.  I have never seen any ufo but I know it was not any plane or anything I have ever seen before..... I was in sort of shock all day at work and I just got home and had to report it Thank you<n>

However, I&#39;m too moved to want to show people what&#39;s been going on down there to just let that slip on by, so I&#39;ll add a few of my tales as well, beginning with last night&#39;s most recent event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, since my first encounter at Wrightsville Beach (will describe later), I have come back a few times with a few different groups of people to show them what I refer to as the &amp;quot;Dancing Star.&amp;quot; It&#39;s a large, yellowish light (sometimes seemingly blinking different colors) that will distinguish itself from its counterparts by moving in swirling, zig-zagging patterns back and fourth, though it still mostly remains true to its general area or &amp;quot;zone.&amp;quot; Upon several inspections of the thing, I realized that right before it moves, you can faintly catch a tiny pinprick of light near it flash before the main star moves towards it. I called the motion &amp;quot;kiting,&amp;quot; since it seemed that the small pinpricks would determine where the star moved to. It appears in random areas of the sky, sometimes even switching positions throughout the night. As a hobby, my friends and I go check it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, last night I was in a particular mood and wanted to go see if we could find it again. I was with my friend who agreed it would probably be a good night to just go relax for a bit: the moon was full (or at least close), and there was a lightning storm off in the distance (this time, to the opposite of the shore). We usually hang out in the area of Wrightsville that&#39;s all the way to the right where you park by the gazebo. From there, we walk down to the left for a bit until we reach the breaker in the water and usually plop down there. Well, tonight was no different: he decided to lay down on the sand and star gaze while I, a bit further up and closer to the water, squatted down and began singing to myself. It&#39;s what I do here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About fifteen minutes had passed with me singing and my friend taking a nap close by. I had my back turned to the ocean and was singing in the direction of the lightning storm, since it was particularly gorgeous, when I suddenly felt compelled to turn around to face the ocean again and I saw it once more: hanging low to the ocean and very bright, it seemed to slowly appear as if out of mist or fog. This time there were two lights, one on top of the other. Both much more yellow and brighter than the neighboring stars. There were no clouds from the direction where they appeared, but like I described, they seemed to just sort of swim into view. The top, dimmer &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; stayed stationary in its movement towards us, while the lower star seemed to swing while it moved, like a pendulum suspended from the top one. Both moved together, though, and were recognizable as one. They got closer and stayed there. I didn&#39;t freak out since I&#39;d seen a similar situation last year around! this same time (around June-July), so I just kept watching it and singing to myself. In between songs, it would move to the right at a fairly quick speed. As soon as I&#39;d begin again, though, it&#39;d move back left and lock itself into a place in &amp;quot;front&amp;quot; of me on the horizon line. I also tried talking at it, unsuccessfully.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were flashes of what seemed to be &amp;quot;heat lightning&amp;quot; coming from around it, even though the actual storm was still far off in the opposite direction and there were no clouds to speak of near the thing. But the first time I saw this thing manifest, there was also such &amp;quot;heat lightning.&amp;quot; It stayed there the whole time we were there watching it all, though it didn&#39;t do much except move back and forth and fluctuate its brightness.  Mind you, not twinkling like planets, but it would get noticeably brighter, like a yellow-orange flashlight in the sky and then dim down super dim and then return to a nice, healthy medium-strength glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the glow of morning began to rise in a blue hue, I told it &amp;quot;Good morning&amp;quot; in a tone of more so a &amp;quot;goodbye&amp;quot; and when I looked up above me (just to see if there was anything else interesting going on; I&#39;m always looking everywhere at that place), I saw a pale white light form, brighten, and dart away -- too slow to be a shooting star and too fast to be anything else. We both agreed it was time to go, then. The two &amp;quot;star-forms&amp;quot; it took stayed there in the sky, though when my friend pulled up his star map ap on his phone, they didn&#39;t register as anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> +_+_+_+_+_+  Now this same situation happened last year around this time and with the same company, and again at around three thirty a.m. til sunrise. We were down at the same spot and I was, again, singing while watching a lightning storm (this time, this one was over the water far along the horizon). I kept finding it kind of weird how the bolts of lighting that were visible from the storm kept seemingly striking the same spot, but I dismissed that. Then, a bright, yellow star emerged from among the storm clouds, became very bright and yellow, and began to &amp;quot;dance&amp;quot; around. It zig zagged and looped. I thought it was a plane at first. It did, however, get closer to us in the sky and when it did it seemed to have a slight trail/tail -- could have been the light, though. I wasn&#39;t blinking very much when watching it. It ended up sticking around for about a good two hours, moving about in the same fashion, before it stopped, dimmed, and something else happened:  Close to us, appearing (again, almost as if from mist) along the shore line was this boomerang like sliver of red light. It was swaying back and fourth like a lantern at around the same speed as one would carried by someone with a bit of a limp. It kept getting closer. Mind you, I was a bit scared at this point. My friend, even, was about to bolt if need be, but we decided to brave it and see what it was (though we didn&#39;t move). Eventually, the thing stretched itself out further into a crescent and looked almost feather like. The swinging slowed down. It was quite a few feet far away from us -- I&#39;m pretty sure it just looked closer than it actually was, but compared to the rest of the actual celestial bodies, it was noticeably closer, y&#39;know? It gave the impression of hovering over the water, though it cast no reflection. Then became brighter and yellow until it looked like a crescent moon. This night was a New Moon night. I remember it was the reason I went to the beach. I ! figured I could see the stars perfectly on a night like that. Well, it took the shape of a moon and hovered there for about a minute and then began moving quickly to the right along the sky line. Then it would stop for about thirty seconds and then move slightly slower backward. It moved as if someone was pulling a lure through water. Fast and smooth at first then slowing and easing into its stops. No trails. It was very strange. So we kept watching it in fascination all night until dawn came. Then, again, I saw what I thought was a shooting star dart off near it and the thing stopped moving and kind of &amp;quot;dissolved.&amp;quot;  Also, on some nights when its been active, a low, loud humming note can be heard. Other than that, though, the objects make no noises. I don&#39;t know if its related or not. I didn&#39;t take pictures because I initially figured it might scare it away and I wanted to absorb all I could from the moment. Next time, however, I may just have to take an adequate video.<n>

In 2005 in Tacoma, WA. a man walked up to me, I believe he was from the department of Defense, DOD, I have never seen him before, but his message was, why we had not been back to the moon, he told me that  there is a glass dome on the planet and we are to stay away. I told him my story about 1979, a story that is very real and a story that I will never forget.  He said that I was visited by (Pleiadians), Cool; this explains why I am an Electronic Eng. and at one time was trained in Micro wave Technology for SAM’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up on the top of a hill; all I do is monitor the skies.  I am curious about the two bright Orange lights flying in tandem one at a higher altitude then the other.  I watched them as I always watch air craft my whole life.  Orange, I have never seen orange, and then they disappeared in front of me, in clear skies.  I do not believe that they turned, they just disappeared. Question is were they drones.? I also witnessed a large meteorite cross the sky in front of me in Utah in 1984.  I have also seen a translucent light move across the night sky that was weird. I am interested in the orange lights if anyone can explain them.  Thanks<n>

About 300 feet in front of me I saw two hazy mint green orbs floating, about eight feet above the ground. They were each a little larger than a grapefruit (possibly bigger), almost sparkled (maybe that signifies lights) and had about three feet of space between them.  The three feet of space acted as an imaginary horizontal line across the middle of the road even though the orbs seemed to be independent of each other. In an instant, metal prongs, thin in nature and almost rectangular shaped, jutted out around the diameter (middle) of each orb (left/right, not up/down).  Then, each orb spun (left/right) independently in their places and shot up into the sky, leaving an almost glow where they had just been hovering.  This happened so quickly that they were out of sight completely by the time I drove through the place where they had been.  From the time I saw them to the time they shot into the sky, it was only a five second time span. It all felt very advanced, direct and incredibly fast.<n>

Far too erratic to be an airplane, and moving too quickly to be a weather ballon.  The object stayed in the same general area and moved back-and forth several times for a few minutes.  A second object similar object appeared close-by after a few minutes with the same erratic movements.  Did anyone else see these strange lights over DC?<n>

It wasn&#39;t moving, just staying in the air.  I pointed it out to my cousin, and she said it must be a plane. Then it started moving, faster than a plane would.  We could clearly see the shape. It was square, with 4 red lights at each corner of the craft.  It seemed to be dark gray or black. Before my cousin had the chance to catch it on film, it was already over Casco Bay and into the Portland area.  Although there may not be any connection, two police cars had their sirens on and started going across the bridge just as it moved into Portland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked exactly like the ones in these pictures:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.ufopictures.info/triangular/<n>

I asked if my friend could see them too, they confirmed.  I continued to watch for 30 seconds or so after noticing them to see if they were just lights or something else.  They both moved slowly, one moving upward the other down, confirming they were not just lights.  They came to a full stop then started to fade away.  I&#39;m not sure if they were moving away or just faded out of the visible light spectrum.  The whole thing lasted roughly 2 minutes.<n>

They looked so bright, and had a bit of a disc shape surrounding the bright orange/red center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With my binaculars, they looked like comets, with space dust or something burning around them, and a bit of a short &#34;tail.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them for a couple minutes, then realized I should document them, and ran to get my video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a panic to capture the 4th one that was passing by, almost out of sight, (too many trees here in Washington state), I took a very distorted video.

Once I pointed it out to the others they all saw it too.  It flew slowly and the path it flew was straight, but did vary every so often and go up or down slightly, it flew over us and continued on until it was out of our sight, descending slightly the further it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the fireball type craft was approximately   1/8 to ¼ the size of the moon as we see it on earth.  The craft seemed rather jagged like it was on fire.  It didn’t appear to have a shape other than a jagged ball. It was not close to us but was easily visible.  The craft made no noise, as the planes etc. we see often in our area do.  It was very deep reddish orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second craft I have seen in this general area.   July 4th 1997 I saw a very large craft over Hwy 370 near St. Charles MO, as did thousands of other fireworks watchers.<n>

It was relatively high in the sky but appeared to be very close to my position and yet I couldn&#39;t make out an object associated with the light it was as if it were on fire but there was no flickering nor smoke nor was anything falling from the object.  I was completely floored by the sight of it mostly because this was a relatively large size light, about half the size of my thumb at arms length and larger vertically than horizontally and yet no sound could be heard, no flickering of light such as all aircraft I have seen in the sky display and so I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was.  For a moment I entertained the possiblility it was a meteorite and hoped that if it were one it would drop some material that I could retreive.  As I watched this light proceed in a north to south direction I noticed , again to my right, a q! uick movement and looking that direction I saw another light that seemed to swoop (for want of better way to explain how it appeared to fly) into view coming from a north to south direction and immediately to a east west direction and then again to the same apparent direction as the other light.  It assumed the same height and speed of the other light and this light was also orange and appeared to be on fire but with no flickering.  This object, although seeming to be the same apparent size of the first object was more of a tear-drop shape than the other one and it had a rather spiky appearance to its light.  These objects were entirely composed of light from my view of them I could not make out any features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thinking someone else must be able to see these objects, people were out shooting off fireworks and so the chance that someone was looking up at the sky were pretty good --I felt very excited seeing these objects because I&#39;ve never seen anything like them before and I felt I was seeing a rare sight but by no means did I think I was the only one who could see them.  The big dipper was in the north/northwest sky and was setting..these objects were approximately half-way up the dipper or about half way up the sky in my estimation, about the same height a small aircraft would fly and lower than a jet.  I have seen loads of aircraft in the skies from my backyard and none have ever had lights as large as these two were, not even a helicopter close in the sky would have that type of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights, the second light having moved closer to the first light, continued to move steadily and at the same height in a southerly direction and I watched them looking from one to the other when I noticed the first light I had seen appeared to turn to the west and began to get smaller as if fading out or even burning out?   I watched it completely disappear in less than a minute.  I looked back to the other light and it too turned and began to fade from sight appearing to be going west directly away from me straight ahead of my orientation.  I did not take my eyes off of this one and watched until it appeared to become a tiny white circle such as a star would appear and seemingly to be very far away.  And then it too disappeared.  I watched for another hour on this clear night with a full moon behind me for anything even vaguely resembling what I saw but did not see any further objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before, could these have been some kind of firework?<n>

The first time we saw it was about 10 minutes after the fireworks display had ended.  There were still people launching fireworks from houses nearby but this was not any kind of firework.  We were outside on a friends deck when I noticed a glowing flickering orb parallel to our position at a 45 degree angle. The object appeared to be about a 1/2 mile away at the time moving maybe 5-10mph and appeared to hover at altitude twice as it moved south.  I pointed it out to several friends and they all witnessed it too.  The object as best as I can describe was round, glowing and flickering almost fire like and as far as we could tell silent.  At its closest point to us there was a second smaller object very dim following slightly behind it and off to one side.  It was hard to judge ! the distance of the second object to the first although it did cross it&#39;s path more than once.  This area of downtown Seattle is in the flight path for the airport so there are planes in the sky constantly.  Along the flight path of the object a plane did cross a couple of miles behind and above it.  My point is that we&#39;re all familiar with the lights on the aircraft flying around the sky most evenings and this had a much warmer non blinking glow and was traveling much to slowly for a commercial airliner or private plane.  After about 5 minutes it had traveled pretty far south and we lost sight of it.  The second sighting was about 20 minutes later waiting in traffic on Dexter Ave.  The object appeared east of the previous location on the other side of the lake.  This time it shot up from behind a large hill at about a 45 degree angle then leveled off at what appeared to be the same altitude as before and headed slowly north until it was out of our sight.  This sighting lasted abou! t 2 minutes no second object was seen.  Somebody asked me if I ! thought it was a lantern.  I don&#39;t think so, as it appeared to be under powered flight and moving in a controlled manner. It also appeared far too large for a lantern. There was no significant breeze at the time and without power not sure how it would have later showed up moving in the opposite direction. There is a video posted on Youtube this morning along with comments from other witnesses in the area. The video is NOT mine an is not very well shot, it also does not get across the warmth and orange hue of the object as we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0JM1SFszE<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not suggesting this was E.T. :) but it was most certainly an unidentified flying object.<n>

I live off green river drive, we see a lot of planes coming in from the east. we stopped in the middle of the road and watched it, and first it wasn&#39;t moving then it started heading up slowly and started to disappear east into the sky the lights flickered and dimmed and then it was gone....... So I thought, i said did you see that to my boyfriend and i said it just disappeared and he just looking in the sky and said no it didn&#39;t it came back down and is behind us, I said what?,  he said its right there and i looked and i couldn&#39;t see it, i said where and he said its a shadow, there&#39;s no li! ghts and i looked and ....damn just a black shape in the air just above the trees and coming down in steps. and it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST SEE?.......................................................?<n>

They were moving in a stright line, going west to east.  We do have an air force base in the direction they were moving.  I did not hear any sounds with them. They were not fireworks, that much I am sure of,  they were moving like plains across the sky.  Each one of them was bright red which made me stop and wonder what I was seeing, with no sound of an aircraft. They didn&#39;t flash , just bright red objects flying by.<n>

There aren&#39;t any fireworks that I know of able to showcase that kind of control.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stared at it, then looked at each other and both said &amp;quot;Holy s%$*, a UFO.&amp;quot;  Across the street (about 50 feet away) we heard another person say the same thing, so we weren&#39;t the only ones.  We were sitting on Indian Trail facing north, directly across from IMSA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please, I would like to know if any one else reported this so I know I&#39;m not crazy.

It didn&#39;t even occur to me to at least attempt to take a picture, even though it wouldn&#39;t really show anything definitive.<n>

Looking northwest we noticed a red circle or ball of light moving from west to the east at a slow rate of speed.  Approximately 200 yards to the north on our  property is a tree line that runs southwest to northeast, from this distance the object appeared to be about 100 to 200 feet above the tree line.  Standing on our deck looking north the object appeared to be at about a 25 to 30 degree angle.  The red orb appeared to be about the size of a quarter, very red in color, moving very slow from left to right, west to east traveling about the full length of the tree line.  The object exibited no sound and eventually faded from view, as if a light had been extinguished.   Our home is only 10 miles from Whiteman AFB Mo., but I am certain it was not any type of aircraft from the air b! ase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired USAF NCO that has had 22 years experience working on U S Airforce jet aircraft.  Our home is in the flight path of the aircraft at Whiteman AFB, so I am well aquainted with the lights on different types of aircraft.  The object my wife and I viewed was certainly not a known type of aircraft.<n>

It looked as  though it was in and out of focus even though I had my camera on it the whole time.  We are close to  Paine Field and are constantly seeing aircraft and know the difference between the two.  I either had a  Satellite or a Star as a reference point and the Star or Sattelite was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not quite sure of the altitude of this glowing object but I do know that it was much higher than  an airplane.

We thought it was a local helicopter but as the craft approached it was silent and brilliant in color, like a burning ember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not close enough to discern a clear shape, but seemed almost circular.  It flew in a very controlled manner at a consistent altitude and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed was like that of a helicopter also.  The altitude seemed to be somewhere between 8,000 and 15,000 feet.  Difficult to really estimate the altitude because of our uncertainty of the nature of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it had passed over us and was almost out of our vision field we noticed that the brilliance seemed to weaken just a bit, but then reappeared as it continued on its path to the NNW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The duration of our siting was probably 1 minute, or slightly more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are certain it was not an airplane, nor a helicopter, nor a satell! ite or slow burning shooting star or firework.

But there was something in the sky that caught my son’s eyes.  My wife and kids, son and daughter, were observing the object and while they couldn’t quite get a handle on what it was, I decided to look.  There was a bright red light moving in our direction, almost like a helicopter light searching the ground.  At first I thought that is what it was, looking for people lighting off fireworks during a ban.  Having a fire 50 miles away, a change in the wind had pushed smoke into our area and I thought the light was tinted because of this.  However, it was when it got over us that I dismissed that conclusion.  As I waited for the normal sound of aircraft flying overhead, I kept my eyes on the craft.  No noise could be heard as this object zoomed through the sky above us.  Following the object the whole time, I started to see a basic shape of the object.  When I finally nailed ! down the shape, the shape of an egg, the object started to shimmer in the sky.  Going back to the helicopter theory, I thought; if that was a propeller, there would be a reflection off the bottom of the blades, and a sort of flicker.  There was no flicker; this was more like the moons reflection in a lake with a gentle wave in the water.  It stayed like this for about a few seconds and then disappeared.  During all this time, for the rate of speed this object was moving through the sky, there was not one sound in the sky.  No rumble of an engine, no swooping of a craft cutting through the air; just silence.   This object was void of all normal crafts lighting. No red light on the undercarriage of the craft, no lights around the rudder, no flashing lights around the wings.  Just the single red light at the front of the object, a silhouette, and a shimmering light as it traveled southward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects path Single object Over Fort Collins, CO 80521  Moved from North to South to Southeast  Traveled at a high rate of speed Sky conditions Smoke from fires No smoke or trails left my object No noise No other craft visible Stars were visible as well as thunderhead  I was wearing my glasses.  My family saw the same thing as I.   We had no distractions, no illnesses, no medications, no alcohol or drugs, no obstructions, and a clean view of the object other than it was dark.<n>

We observed the first 2 ( a pair) of 6 orange colored objects that came from the west going towords the east.  We first saw them when they were just above the horizon coming almost directly over head.  It took only a  minute or two for them to get directly over head .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then when they got just past our directly over head position they began to get smaller and smaller , while getting dimer and dimer until they went completely out of sight or disappeared.  It looked as if  they could be going possible straight up. This part only took maybe 10 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then maybe 5 minutes after the first 2 objects disappeared  we observed the first of 4 more orange colored objects coming from the same area in the sky as the other 2 had just came from, the next four would come as singles a few minutes apart, they all  took the same path and disappeared in the  same manner as the first two had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened 3 more times within the next few minutes.  We saw a total of 6.  The objects appeared to be a little larger and a lot brighter than a star, circular in shape and kind of fuzzy around the edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never saw anything like this before,i have no idea what these objects were. 5 or 10 minutes after we saw these objects we saw a passenger jet flying by at probably 35 thousand feet .<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a perfectly clear night, lots of stars were out but don’t remember if there was a moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work for the Department of Transportation in maintence, have a private pilots licence, love to golf , and hunt   My son works in the Timber industry   My daughter is self employed   We have all lived around the area all our lives<n>

There was no sound,and we could tell that it was not a small plane, helicopter, firework or chinese lantern. They were traveling one, two or three in a row, following each other.  They seemed to be moving slowly but then there were a few trailing behind who were quickly trying to catch up with the others.  I witnessed this in my car with my husband and two children ages 14 and 10. I turned around the block as they traveled east and saw them ascending up into the sky and slowly disappearing.<n>

My coworkers and I were standing in the roof of a 3rd floor assisted living facility watching the fireworks when we got off of work. The majority of the fireworks were to the south and east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a strange red orb traveling up and over the Bridger Mountains.  I knew this wasnt a car as there are no roads that go straight up to the top.  I thought maybe a helicopter looking for fires but it didn&#39;t fly like a helicopter.   It seemed to have followed the mountains straight up and hovered within the tree line on top, as I could see the light break up when it went in the trees.  The orb went up and down 3 times.  I left before the orb went away, I didnt think much of it at the time.<n>

We were on West State Street when i looked up and said &amp;quot;what is that?&amp;quot; to my girlfriend. In the sky i saw one orange light flying a little bit faster then a plane. We watched it for a minute and it flew &amp;quot;over&amp;quot; us, at first i thought that it may be a satellite but i could just tell that it was in our atmosphere and not in space. It was just one light ball flying. And then from the same position where i saw the first a seond one appeared. But this one went in a different direction (the first went north, this second one headed east). I was following it when the light it was a emitting started to go out. I COULD STILL SEE THE OBJECT FLYING. i was following it with my eye making sure not to break contact with it, and every couple of seconds the orange light would faintly come on just to go out again. eventuall! y it traveled to far and we couldnt see it anymore. we hop in our truck and race to our friends house to tell him what we saw, and on our way we saw one more BIRGHT red object in the sky. At first glance i thought it may be a planet, BUT IT MOVED. In total we saw THREE. I WISH WE HAD A CAMERA, but honestly with all the fireworks and what not it would have been inconclusive through photograph.<n>

I said to my husband “what the heck is that?” He looked up and said “what the hell!”<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I told him maybe it’s a plane and as he and I kept looking the way they were flying was not normal.  They were apart at first flying together at the same pace and that’s when I thought it was the tips of an airplanes wing, then they got very close together almost touching.  After that they kind of just were sporadically moving around.  Once that was over one stayed real bright the other dimmed down and took off going north, the other still very bright kind of just turned off and went the same direction “North”.   It sounds like a lot but only lasted about 2 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were about the size of a star but a little bigger.  Bright red looked like! a fireball.

A few minutes later, four orbs rose in succession, spaced about 10 degrees apart traveling in the same path as the first, heading SSE  After they disappeared, a sixth orb traveled in the same path.  The wind at the time was from the NE, 1 to 3 mph.  The night was clear and the objects made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

All these events happened probably between 10PM and midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [As an aside, both her family and I are inveterate aircraft buffs and know what they look-like,  sound-like day or night.] She then called me around midnight(0 hrs...7/5/12)(I live 4 mi. to her s.w and have seen UFO&#39;s in my earlier years)and I decided to go outside with 10x binoculars and see if I could see anything.  There was a line of clouds above my house that stretched easterly. I did focus my binoculars on the brightest star to get it set for infinity.  After a wait of maybe 10 minutes I did notice a bright red &#39;large-star-sized&#39; object moving slowly from north to south. It was in the general direction of my daughter&#39;s house.  I used a steady-rest to stop the tremors and watched the object for about 5 min.  It seemed to slow and then either slowly-extinguish or blend into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed out for another 10 minutes and seen nothing else similar and retired to the house.<n>

There were a total of 5 round or circle objects that come up from the east like they were being launched from the ground in front of the full orange moon.  The objects were orange in color and they were in pairs, but there was only a single one in front like a leader, and they didn’t match the firework display their coloring was not as bright like the fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They slowly drifted in the air like in an arch shape and I was very uneasy because I was not sure if they were coming towards me and what they were going to do.  The objects started to slowly move west above me and then I went outside for a clearer picture they then went south and slowly disappeared.  I was not under the influence of alcohol/ drugs.  I had! never witnessed anything like this ever, I believe what I saw were not to be airplanes because I have never seen them fly in pairs and that close to each other, I also know that the airplanes do not fly in that pattern or direction.<n>

The light was moving about the same speed as a small plane, and was moving steadily and in a different direction than the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, we thought it might be some type of Chinese lantern, but the object did not flicker and was moving slightly against the wind.  The object finally drifted into a hazy cloud bank and dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes later we spotted another object going in the same direction and speed but higher up and a little south of the first object.  We watched this object until it was obscured by some trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third onject was about a mile north of the first object and was only in view for a few seconds before being obscured by trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fourth object appeared about 3 minutes later, and was almost overhead.  The object was also going in the same general direction, but a little lower.   We watched it cross the sky for almost a minute before it just seemed to fade out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited for another 20 minutes but saw nothing further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects were a bright orange color, solidly lit, and moved in a steady speed and direction.  They did not flicker, and were not affected by the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were both a little freaked out, and tried to rationalize the sightings with prosaic explanations like small planes, Chinese lanterns, balloons etc.  But there was no noise, and if they were balloons or lanterns, they would have to have been released a mile or two from each other, and at different times rather than from the same place and all at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sincerely hope someone else in the area noticed these objects too!   Although this was on the fourth of July, it had nothing to do with fireworks<n>
7/4/12 22:30|Enumclaw|WA|Circle|5 minutes|07-04-12  Saw 5 orange round objects in the sky|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90678.html|708|ndxe201207| Glowing oval fireball, no sound , so bright, close in distance than in moments as far as a distant star<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night my family was outside enjoying the 4th and all the fireworks in the night sky when we saw a bright light, that at first looked like a left over ember from a firework.  This light did not disperse and instead traveled from North to South as we faced West.  This was about 10:30 pm and it continued south until it disappeared.  After putting the kids to bed, we went back outside to continue to watch the surrounding firework displays.  This time we were on our patio facing East.  About 11:00 pm all of a sudden a bright glowing object came up over our home from that easterly direction (from where the moon was rising).  It was if something was on fire, it glowed with an orange to red color tone, but so bright.  From where I was sitting it was as large as my thumb.  Its shape was like a standing oval.  It was quite large and there was no sound at all.  As we were studying this, another came up right behind it.  It seemed to following the same travel patte! rn.  Then these two objects switched direction from coming towards us (west) to then moving south.  During this specific time of watching the two bright shining objects travel now to the south, we did have an aircraft fly overhead south to north and it was loud.  This reinforced to me that whatever these were had no sound.  These objects kept traveling south until they were the size of a distant star then disappeared as the first did earlier.  As I was getting ready to go back inside in the same spot (south eastern) where the two objects had disappeared a short time before, a glow again appeared traveling now north, back towards me.  It got bright and large  then switched directions and disappeared again going south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a side note, we have had air traffic above our home for the last few years, either commercial airlines which travel at a much higher altitude moving from south to north, or air traffic coming from Joint Fort Lewis McCord, which usually travels from an easterly to westerly direction.  The aircrafts that usually come from Joint Fort Lewis McCord are so loud and close that they shake the house windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever was in the sky, seemed more like it was floating, at times looking like it was stationary, kinda like an air balloon.  It glowed as if on fire, changing colors from bright yellow, to orange to red.  It made no sound and had to be traveling quite fast to have the mass of half the moon, to in just a minute or two a small distant star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was with my adult children, sitting in a group of thousands of people and you could see people in the crowd noticing and pointing to the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, is resembled a firework &#34;fall out&#34; but it never dimmed like a burning object would of.  About an hour later, at my home 3 blocks from park where first sighting took place, I was watching neighborhood fireworks and suddenly the same type of glowing orb appeared in the sky.  Once again, it just floated as if it was riding an air current.  It floated around this area for about 15 mins until it got high enough or far enough that it looked smaller. It didn&#39;t flash or strobe.  The light was not bright it looked liked the amber glow of a flame.  There was not any noise associated with it.  The night sky was clear and star filled.  There was enou! gh pause between fireworks that the sky was not smoke filled.  When I spoke to my friend this morning, the first words out of her mouth was did you see the UFO?&#34;  Her family witnessed the same glowing orbs that I did, at the same times and saw an additional one around 01:00.<n>

It did not demonstrate the capabilities of any helicopter or light aircraft I&#39;m familiar with, nor was it displaying the requisite port/starboard lighting.  The object traveled due west off the coast, just to our north, and then faded away.  I&#39;m emailing the video I shot with my phone.  An obvious police aircraft was seen traveling along the coast, from north to south, immediately after.<n>

My van was facing west and we had a clear view of the fireworks which rose above the houses in front of us. The sky was clear and there was no wind at the time.  My wife noticed a red glowing ball of light which was at about a 60 degree angle from us and appeared to be as high as the highest point of the exploding fireworks. At first we both thought it was debris still burning from a firework but it continued to glow.  It seemed to smoothly and slowly gain height, traveling in a straight line from the northwest to southeast.  I had rolled down the driver&#39;s side window to take a better look.  I did not see a flashing beacon or any other colors of light which are typically seen on aircraft.  The ball of light did not blink and remained a solid red color.  It appeared to be slightly larger than the size of a star.  It made! no sound and continued heading southeast until it just seemed to vanish.<n>

I noticed a Red Light traveling directly towards us.  I first thought it was a low flying plane or helicopter.  After a few seconds I told my mother that &#34;something is not normal.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood and walked to a very low fence to observe and noticed the second red light travelling parallel to the other about 1000 feet apart.  Both were silent and were traveling at a very high speed South from the Norman, Oklahoma, area directly North to Moore, Oklahoma.  The red ball flying on the East disappeared less than a quarter mile from my location.  The red ball on the West side flew directly over the house and continued for several mile North and disappeared as well.  I had my phone in hand, but was so intrigued that I never thought to capture on film or photo.  As it was the 4th of July, it seems there had to by many other witnesses to this sighting.<n>

My back was facing North and her back was facing South. As we were talking she got really quiet and said, &#34;Look at that low flying plane.&#34;  I turned around to see what she was talking about and saw a low flying, orange/amber colored round object.  It appeared in the Northeast, coming out of complete thin air and it was traveling South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowly floated across the sky ascending higher into the sky.  Once it reached a high altitude, it sped up, extremely fast, and then &#34;blip,&#34; it was gone.  This lasted for about 45 seconds. When trying to catch it on camera it showed as a bright white light.  After looking at the video it was clear that the camera, in fact, did not catch anything.  But, when watching as it was recording you could clearly see that something was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend went inside to get her camera, which she checked was fully charged.  After about 5-7 minutes the same ritual happened.  My friend went to record it on her camera and the battery was instantly drained.  The camera went from a full charge to nothing.  The UFO we spotted made the same flight path four times all within a 30 minute duration.  I did manage to snap a picture of it, where it looks like a small, bright, white light.  But, when looking at it from the ground with the naked eye it looks like an amber colored ball.  The direction it was coming from was not shooting off fireworks, but it traveled in the direction towards where fireworks were being shot off at.  Once the finale for the fireworks happened, no more sightings occurred.<n>

I looked up and showed my daughters...they were captivated by what it possibly could be. Then we saw one from the south and then another from the north.  They were like glowing orange orbs with an aura of white/red. Almost as if they were on fire.  They hovered slowly..and would speed up and seem to &amp;quot;dance&amp;quot; in the sky. I at first thought maybe just embers from the display..but not for that amount of time.  There was no sound at all! It wasn&#39;t an aircraft that I have come to know or see.<n>

I spotted lights so I look up in the sky to see if it is a plane or something. I looked again and I noticed it was still there just hovering.  At that point I yelled at my girlfriend, “It’s a fucking UFO!” Then my girlfriend saw it as well and confirmed that it must have been a UFO.  I wanted to take a picture so I decided to pull over on the freeway but unfortunately there were trees blocking the object.  We proceeded to continue on the freeway and it was still there hovering up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a disk shaped with lights and a single light on top.  The lights were slightly orange.

We could have seen it longer but we were on the freeway so we had to pass it because we couldn’t stop, so I do not know how much time it was hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object we saw was disk shaped with lights on the outer rim, and then a few feet above the disk was just a light which was the tip top of the object.  This was all one ship but the body of it that led to the light at the tip top did not have lights.  The disk with the lights on the outer rim was spinning in a circle constantly while the body and light at the very top was not moving.  The whole entire object was hovering in one spot.

Then I observed 2 more identical orange lights each equidistant from each other and following the first.  There was no sound.  When I reached the corner about 40 feet away to see where they had gone they had disappeared.  The next night I saw the late night incoming plane.  It had a white/yellow headlight (like a star) and a small flashing red light, nothing like the orange object.<n>

The fireworks show was almost at its end.  Then, something caught my eye near the full moon.  The moon was about 30 degrees up from the horizon and mostly to the south of us. There were four orange spheres moving away from the sight of the moon.  These four lights were in a straight line and appeared to be moving towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The line that they were traveling looked like they were coming up from the SE direction.  This is a used flight pattern from Pendleton, OR to Seattle, WA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were moving slowly along the sight of the full moon.  One person, who was also distracted from the fireworks show, asked us what those light were.  It was at that time that the lights began to fade out.  One by one, the light slowly faded as they past over the line sight of the moon. We wait for some time later to see if they were just high flying planes.  If they were, they would have flew over a short time later.  We waiting for about another 20 minutes.  There was no sign of anything in the night sky. Where did they go? Another cool mystery.<n>

I, my wife, and 2 teen aged daughters were present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 10:11 pm, a glowing orange object appeared in the northeastern sky.  The object was traveling very quickly in a southeast direction, and it disappeared in the southern sky about 30 seconds later.  The object was flying at an altitude lower than airplanes in the area travel.  The object did not make any sound.  It was evident from both the altitude of the object, the distance it traveled, its size, and the fact that it made no sound that it was not fireworks. The fireworks being lit in the neighborhood were of the consumer variety, not the kind used by professional fireworks show producers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One witness, my 19 year old daughter, described the object at &#34;a  round orange ball.&#34;   She also described it as looking like &#34;a crown.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife described it as &#34;glowing,&#34; and appearing to look like &#34;a hot air balloon.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 14 year old daughter described it as &#34;red, glowing, pentagon of fire.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the area’s proximity to the Louisville International Airport approximately 8 miles away and Bowman Field airport about 5 miles away, there is a lot of aircraft in the area at all hours of the day and night.

We followed the lights one disappeared suddenly and we watched the other keep going until it was no longer visible (20 seconds)  There was no sound.

It was above 70 degrees above us and was the size of about 10 stars.  We were facing south when we saw it, and it traveled east.

Nothing incredible showed up at first glance, but then the photographer decided to zoom in &amp; started getting different sized red, white, &amp; blue lights appearing in the digital photographs, which were not apparently visible through the camera scope alone, nor to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He showed a few others his pics, &amp; upon seeing them I ran to get my telescope.  It is not much for a tele mind ya, but I couldn&#39;t see the objects with it either. We took turns looking through the tele as the photographer continued taking pictures, almost all of which captureded these mysterious lights, but in different locations each time, as if they were moving.  I messed with the digital images on my pc some, magnifying some pictures to try &amp; gain a better understanding of exactly what we may be looking at.. but retained the originals as well as their filenames when saving magnified images.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not in a good situation financially at the moment, so mailing or &#39;ups&#39;-ing may not be the best means for me at this time, but I have all the pictures both on my pc &amp; on flashdrive here, if there is some way I can email or otherwise post them(?)   Also, only lately have I begun &#39;looking up&#39; quite so much, as recent sightings while out with freinds have been recurring to the point it&#39;s almost impossible not to notice..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Awhile after dusk on June 10 2012, while finishing up a game of 21 (basketball) at the Lawrence township recreation park in Clearfield PA, one of the 5 adults &amp; 5 children there at the time (I think it was Amber, my fiance&#39;) made a comment to the effect of &amp;quot;wow, wtf is that?!&amp;quot; &amp; pointed to an extremely bright light in the sky. All of the adults &amp; all but 1 of the children took immediate notice of the almost unnaturally bright light seemingly hovering motionlessly overhead, &amp; in as little time as it took for me to think &amp;quot;whoa that can&#39;t be venus because it just passed in front of the sun a few days ago &amp; isn&#39;t out this early in the night this time of year&amp;quot; the object suddenly decreased significantly in luminousity, then accellerated towards what I believe to be a south-eastern-ish direction. It continued it&#39;s direction of travel for several seconds while the light faded &amp; brightened several times before apparently vanishing into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a week later, while saying our so-longs &amp; such, a younger brother of one of the witnesses to the first sighting was preparing to leave my place when I noticed a very similar bright white light in the southern sky traveling at a fairly quick rate of speed in an eastern direction. I pointed it out to my freind, and he &#39;kept an eye on it&#39; as I ran to get my telescope. But, of course, by the time I returned with it, according to my friend, it had also just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Those incedents may or may not be related in any way, but seeing as these are the first we&#39;ve managed to actually photograph I would love for someone who has seen much more than I could hope to have a look and see what they think of it all..

I wouldn&#39;t say it was completely circular but more like a sideways egg that was glowing reddish-orange.  This lasted about 20minutes before it just glided away back into the atmosphere.  Oh yea and there were several aircrafts in the area since SeaTac is just across the valley from us.<n>

I didn’t think much about it because it was the fourth of July; however, he pointed out four unusual red/orange lights that hovered in unison from the east to west direction.  Our back deck faces north. It was peculiar to see these lights drifting slowly from east to west against the night sky when there were plenty of fireworks.  The first three set of lights were in a triangle shape with the fourth trailing behind. We then called our oldest 17-year old son to see these lights and ask what he thought about them. Shortly after he came to see them we noticed that the first three set of lights in a triangle shape lost the first bottom left light, as it simply disappeared.  Our 17-year old also agreed how odd the lights appeared. We noticed some airplanes to the southeast of us, and we could slightly hear their engines.  The light! s hovered together and kept in the same distance for some time.  The lights began to trail behind a set of trees and as we moved to see if we could see them we noticed that the remaining two from the triangle disappeared, but the last trailing light remained. My eleven-year old son and I went further into the east section of our yard to see the light before it completely went behind the trees, but when we saw it it disappeared.  There was no noise or and sound with this object, and of course we could hear some loud booms from the fireworks in the sky.  My husband and I had not drunk any alcohol or anything like that and had just finished a cup of coffee when we saw this.  So we were very awake and aware of what was occurring. Later about 22:40, we saw something that looked like fireballs in the sky.  These “flames” looked like balls or firedrops hovering slowly in a circular pattern in the nightsky, which was interesting against the fireworks exploding in the sky. These lights a! ppeared to be observing. I went inside and grabbed my binocula! rs to lo ok at these objects. One in particular was unusually close and through the lens of the binoculars it still just looked like a firelight, but smaller?  We (my husband and I) carefully observed it to see whether it was a helicopter or an airplane of some sort take pictures of the fireworks. We are aware that aircraft taking pictures of fireworks is not unusual this time of year, yet we dismissed this possibility when they did not closely resemble aircraft.  We only wonder if anyone saw the same thing.<n>

About 9:30PM last night two friends and I went up on my roof and sat in chairs facing West, giving us a sweeping view of Puget Sound, Vashon, Baimbridge and Blake islands and the Olympic mountains. It was twilight, and there were multiple fireworks going off both on our side of the Sound and across on the islands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly all three of us noticed two bright reddish orange lights flying southward, in tandem, down the Sound. I would estimate that they were at 5,000 feet altitude, flying slightly faster than a jet, maintaining equal distance from one another, and completely silent.  They were about the size of a large jet, but were just glowing lights, with no visible structure.  As they flew over the North tip of Vashon Island, they both appeared to slow down, and the one that was slightly ahead began to dim.  They continued on their course until we could no longer see them (behind some trees in my yard).  We were amazed and were discussing what they possibly could have been when another light, this time solo, followed the exact same path down the sound. At this point, I ran down to grab some high powered binoculars, and within a few minutes another light followed in the same path as the prior three.  This time I was able to get a much closer look, focusing in on it with the binoculars.  It l ooked like a fireball, with a red glow behind it.  This one too slowed and dimmed but never fully faded.  Over the course of the next half hour, five more of these lights came down the sound.  We saw one jet, flying Northwesterly from Seatac airport, clearly make a large turn to avoid the passing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot stress enough that these lights were no part of the fireworks displays.  They were much higher in the sky, and we had a clear view of each one for at least 30 seconds as it flew from North to South.  Even though the main firework event was going on 10 miles North of us over Lake Union in Seattle, Im sure there were thousands of people watching fireworks over Puget Sound and it would have been impossible to miss these lights traveling down the sound. I thought there would be a story about it on the news this morning, but I didnt hear a word about it.<n>

I have an extreme history in experimental and civilian aircraft and have been to &#34;Oshkosh&#34; airshow many times  (The biggest airshow in the world) and know 100% that this was NOT a man made aircraft.  No aircraft are MADE to look like they are on fire or are on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After online research I realized this may be some kind of UFO,  It&#39;s like they were just around to see our fireworks!  To me if this is aliens it makes sense, they just wanted to watch like we do, but it&#39;s weird since we live so close to a military base that nothing was scrambled to see what it was that night unless they knew what it was, in that case, the GOV is up to some weird stuff, but if they come to my apartment after this I&#39;ll hopefully let you know!<n>

We were all outback carrying on when i went to walk over to the side of my yard with 2 of my friends to talk because it was getting kind of loud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking to the West when i noticed an orange/amber colored sphere pretty high up in the air moving towards us in the sky.  I myself am an amateur astronomer and my friends both have credible backgrounds.  1 military and 1 works at an international airport as a plane mechanic.  So all and all we are all pretty familiar with what can be seen in the sky collectively.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also usually do a fireworks display every year.  We all confirmed at the altitude, lack of sound (0 sound being emitted from the object) and speed that this object was nothing that we had ever seen.  We watched the object from from west to east then turn towards the city of Philadelphia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over us, it went from its almost floating speed to a fast dart at which point it vanished out of view in a matter of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before we could even comment on what we just saw another object same size, altitude, speed, and flight path as the previous one.  We instantly were in awe and had no idea what we just saw after the second one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were able to rule out a plane do the fact a plane flew overhead during the occurrence and the altitude of these objects were much higher despite how bright they were. I was able to rule out any kind of meteor or firework.  We were left baffled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I informed my cousin of the occurrence and he was intrigued by it which led to him calling me 3 months later as he was driving down the PA turnpike and witnessed the same thing only with more objects which he promptly pulled over and recorded it on his Nikon dslr.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He even followed down the highway and continued filming which was interesting at one point because the object while he was driving moved so fast he couldn&#39;t keep it in frame when it stopped and changed directions completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just! found out about this website and its purpose, and was hoping to submit the event I saw on the 4th and my cousins in the hopes to maybe find an answer or well share what happened.<n>

I assumed it was just an airplane or helicopter, so I went back to watching the citizens of the area light off their personal fireworks prior to the main event and lost track of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, the three of us together noticed three more orbs, like the first one I had seen, in an uneven tandem formation approaching the area very slowly from the south.  I thought they might be helicopters because of the formation’s very slow speed, and so I continued to chat with my wife and mother-in-law while we watched the orbs.  After the formation slowed almost to a hover about a mile away, the lead object slowly turned right to the east while the other two remained approximately in place.  As the lead object slowly proceeded on its new trajectory, it gradually transitioned from a pulsating reddish-orange color to a smaller solid-whitish light until it seemed to disappear.  My wife said something about “UFOs,” and even someone in the crowd behind us remarked that they might be UFOs, but I still continued to think they HAD to be aircraft.  But, what puzzled me was the oversize pulsating reddish-orange color and the lack of a standard aircraft position lighti! ng scheme of small, solid red and green lights with a white strobe.  When the fireworks show began, our attention was transferred to the spectacular display and the orbs were forgotten.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After taking my mother-in-law home, my wife and I were east-bound on Memorial Hwy (SR 536) driving back to our trailer in West Mount Vernon, when my wife noticed a single reddish-orange pulsating orb off to the south less than a mile away.  We pulled our car off to the side of the road and stopped to get out of our car and better observe the object’s behavior.  The soundless orb was slowly paralleling the road in a straight line about 500 feet in the air when it gradually morphed to a small point of white light before it went behind a tree that blocked our view.  We excitedly left for home after we were unable to find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home, we searched the sky outside for about 10 minutes to see if we could observe any more of the objects, but we failed to see anything other than two separate aircraft (we could see their familiar outline) fly by with their trademark white strobe-light with red and green position-lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us had ever seen anything like those large, silent, pulsating reddish-orange orbs before!<n>

First sighting was of two amber &#39;orbs&#39; moving high up at a fast pace in formation.  Over the next 45 minutes (we came inside at that time) we witnessed at least 15 of these coming from the South direction heading towards the north.  They were varying distances from us. Some were much more close up than others.  Distinctly NOT planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had binoculars and a phone camera.  It was too dark, even with low light settings to get any pictures.  Through the binoculars, there was a round, glowing shape.  They seemed to be more red in color the further away they were and more orange/amber as they got closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As it went far east, it circled and then went out. within a matter of 3 minutes the second one came from tree line and changed speed, went from very fast to slower but in same direction flickering...not as  plane but a fireball . Went length of sky and turned east to then south and then spat out.  There was no way these were fireworks as they straight level in sky , never changed altitude, did not fall to ground or fizz out , they circled. estimate 3 minutes apart from first sighting to second.<n>

The object was traveling towards me. The object was about 1-2 miles high, and turned gradually to the east.  The object seemed to accent gradually and fade into the distance.  At first it looked like a helicopter with a red light.  As it got closer there was no sound and it was mostly red with a little bit of orange at the 6 o&#39;clock position.  It almost looked like a spot light.  The object was by itself.<n>

Saw the first (and single) object moving slowly from north to south directly over our head.  At first thought it was a helicopter, but had an orange/red glow and no navigation lights and no sound.  Then thought it might be an airplane at high elevation catching the sun.  It moved south and then disappeared; thought it may have gone into the shadow of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps 10 minutes later saw two similar lights/objects moving from south to north and far to the south.  Very close together it seemed – and too close to each other to be airplanes.  They disappeared as they moved to the north.  Which seems odd if they were entering the earth’s shadow, as the first object disappeared as it moved south.  There may have been one or two lights/objects off to the east at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then during the height of the Lake Union fireworks show about 15 minutes later there were numerous lights/objects (five?) far off to the east moving north to south, with two of the objects close together.   They disappeared as they moved slowly to the south, but did not disappear at the same time, and also did not disappear at the same latitude (so perhaps not due to the earth’s shadow).  All of the sightings lasted for perhaps 1 to 2 minutes before they would disappear.  Other than the two possible pairs of objects, they were not in any formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live outside of the city of Seattle but am tempted to head back tomorrow night, and it should be similar weather conditions, to see if this occurs again which may indicate that it is a normal occurrence of airplane reflections.  But that did not seem to be the case.<n>

We saw more this evening around 10pm than any other year: probably about 6, each in it&#39;s own position. (Not in a group.)  All sightings moved exactly the same, however.  Silently and in the same direction (from the NW to the SE).  Each had the same speed: guessing about 10 mph?  All were also at the same altitude.  Each also just suddenly disappeared while watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As noted, we have been mesmerized by this unique sighting for years and have posted UFO reports. Each year, however, we have only witnessed one over Bothell.  This year was exciting as we saw many. As always, we see these on the 4th of July.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can share we had a revelation this year as we experienced this orb up close and our understanding of what we have witnessed was changed.  A new &#34;firework&#34; was avaialble for purchase at our local shop called the Chinese Lantern.  We set 3 of these off ourselves: one red, one orange, and one pink.  Each had a fire actually in flame which raised this 2 ft long x 1 ft long paper lantern directly up. It moved SE as the wind came from the NW.  It floated quickly up and the higher it got the faster it moved. It was silent, of course.  It glowed &#34;orange&#34; from within.  Explaining that beautiful &#34;lit from within&#34; result we&#39;ve witnessed over the years.  It glided steadily as we watched and the suddenly just went out.  It I took pictures of it with my 12x zoom level and compared it to the pictures of the orange orbs that moved over head.  They looked exactly the same. (I will include them with this report.)  All sightings moved SE with the wind direction, and all were at the same altitude ! and speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This reports our personal sightings here in Bothell which always occur on the 4th of July.  We believe our sightings have been the Chinese Lanterns.  However, it is not intended to explain that is what all orb sightings are.<n>

I vivedly remember searching for wings or the parts of a helicopter; something that would indicate to me it was an identifiable aircraft. There were none.  I noted there was no sound.  There was a reddish glow around the disc.  It did not blink. About 4 seconds into watching, I realized what I was seeing.   I ran back into the house and yelled for my relative who came out just in time to see the it as it dipped below pine trees and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We watched it move over a line of trees, slowly towards the left and then after about a minute it disappeared.  We started talking about how weird that was and how it might have been some leftover fire works when another orb that looked just like the other one, red and bright, came from the exact same position and moved exactly like the other one.  We videoed it and watched it go to the same place the first orb had gone and just like the other, after about 1 minute, it disappeared.  No other orbs came into sight after the second one vanished.<n>

I immediately looked to my friend and said, &#34;Oh my gosh, what is that?  Is that a planet; is it Saturn since it&#39;s red?   No, is that an airplane?  No... it&#39;s not either one…&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then she looked up at it and seemed to be just as confused as I was.  This object was bright red, unmistakably red.  Also, it let off a hazy kind of light.  I was honestly baffled at the site and looked to my parents for their opinion, expecting them to not think it was anything out of the ordinary.  Then as they took a look, they both agreed that it was in fact NOT a plane, burning star, planet, or anything of a cosmic sort.  I quickly took a picture with my iPhone to then find that it disappeared shortly after. It went from right to left, almost in a diagonal line. We stood there, shocked.  Then only about ten seconds later, another red circle appears.  My mom pred! icted that this one would follow suit and disappear like the last one.  However, I videoed this one for a minute and 16 seconds.  I started the video about ten seconds after I saw it and then videoed it until it vanished. It seems as though it went off in the distance too far for us to see anymore.  I don&#39;t think anyone else around us saw it; everyone was driving past and no one seemed to notice.  I found the whole situation very odd and to see two objects do the exact same thing was just bizzare.  This definitely goes down as a UFO siting in my book.<n>

I know it&#39;s the 4th of July and everyone is shooting off fireworks – At 9:45pm, I was heading north on Harvard Ave. near Pine St. and I noticed this sparkly orb in the sky about a 1/2 mile up, I thought to myself &#34;That&#39;s a cool firework&#34; -- but it just hung there and kept changing colors. &#34;Well, maybe it&#39;s one of those with a Parachute attached too it?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got to Harvard and Apache and it was still there, so I pulled over and got out of my car, looked at it for about 10 seconds and it was changing colors and all... then a large burst firework went off in the sky about a half block to my right -- then suddenly, in a blink..the orb shot north about a 1/3 of a mile, paused, in less then a second, it then took off further north about 5 miles -- then it was gone.

I had a camera in my hand to take some family photos.  I noticed what appeared to be a dark circular or oval shaped object moving from north to south above my home.  This object was not an airplane, did not emit any noise, and seemed to disappear as quickly as it came into sight. This happened just about the time when everyone was beginning their fireworks show. It was still somewhat daylight also.  I took as many photos as I could, my hands were so shaky after I saw this thing it was hard to stay stable.  I have witnessed objects before that I have never reported out of reluctance or fear to do so.  What was different this night is that more came as the night went on. Soon after the first one I noticed, I looked to the south of where I stood and I noticed a bright glowing object slowly moving in my direction.  Where I live I have! a ton of trees all around me so trying to photograph these things is difficult.  Behind and to the left of the first fireball looking object followed another one and another behind that one.  Then from behind the view of the trees one to the right of the first one appeared.  This is when I demanded attention from my 20 year old son who always blew me off as crazy, to witness this event with me.  I have to admit I was shaken up from this.  We continued to observe the objects and tried to take photos and videos.  They were moving across from right to left, left to right but I’d lose them because they would dim out or move out of view behind the trees.  Next thing I saw is a few of them coming from behind me again from north heading south (ish)  Because they’d dim out of view I couldn’t keep track of which one was doing what so I can’t tell you positively that there were any more in number than what I counted as being visible all at once which was 5.  There could have been more, or so! me of the five I saw that disappeared in my view could have be! en some of the same that came from behind me again.  It seemed as if they were on patrol. Moving over the area during the peak of the firework displays around the area I live in. They were all actively moving about as if floating and in no particular formation.  I saw one cross up and over in one direction while another one crossed its path in another direction while another one yet would come from out of nowhere on one of either side of me. I am a 40 yr. old mother of three children, currently attending college to get my AAS as a Paralegal.  I’ll be finished in December.  I was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol during this unforgettable experience.  But I sure needed a drink by the time I called it quits which was sometime between 11:45 (ish) and Midnight.  I have not yet gone through my pics to see if I captured anything good, but I’ll get them to you as soon as I am able to get to them.  Right now it’s 1:37am July 5th, and I’m still in shock, and stunned to say the least a! t what I witnessed tonight.  My son and I are willing to speak with anyone who’s interested.  Also I’ll be very surprised if no one else reports this.   Many people would have seen the same objects as my son and I. There’s no possible way they could not have.<n>

My husband and i could see the fireworks still going on North.  We assume the fireworks were going on in Sunrise, Florida.  After the fireworks were done there were 7 red lights in a vertical line much brighter than any firework, and they lingered brightly for about 20 seconds.  Without saying a word to each other, both my husband and I stopped walking trying to figure out what we were looking at.  The location did not coincide with Hollywood Intl. Airport or the Fort Lauderdale executive airport.  The red lights were too far and too bright to be planes.  We are about 10 miles from Hollywood Intl. Airport and could actually see planes heading in that direction so we could clearly compare the plane’s flashing red lights with the constant red light hovering at a fixed location in the sky.  After the lights disappeared (not faded, just disappeared) my husband just said that was probably our first ! UFO sighting.<n>

It came really fast, going faster than      60 mph. it had a headlight on at first but it turned off around half-way through.  The shape was oval-ish  (sorry can’t find how to spell that) and had a one red light at the end.  It was going parallel to K-7.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this whole thing there was no noise.  So it could not be a jet. It was also very low. Lower than the airplanes. The red light was bright. It was brighter than a normal helicopter’s tail-fins light, and no helicopter blades.  One of my family members does not believe in UFOs and said it was a “weather balloon.”  It was nothing like a weather balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for reading!  :)<n>

There were 8 witnesses to these crafts. Assuming they were fireworks, they were ignored until they began hovering horizontally.  One appeared, then another and soon there were 4. They were all equidistant from one another and slowly moving across the sky.  They were orange and flickered. They were way off in the distance so I am not sure what city they were right above.  Then one by one they flickered out after 5 minutes. 10 minutes later one lonely orange light appeared in the same spot as the others for about a minute and flickered out. An hour later, one light was seen right above us moving pretty fast.  There is an airport near by and aircrafts can be heard from the area but there was no sound.  It was very bright orange and pulsated gently.  It looked similar to a fireball.  The pulsating light seemed to move in and out from the object but never separated ! from it.  The craft didn’t fly off into the distance, it just disappeared.<n>

At the moment I thought it was a flare, but it moved to the left and front up and down and had a behavior not typical of a flare.  After this one disappeared the next one appeared more or less in the same place and traced a similar path.  I am sure they were not flares because the behavior was not of flares.  They stopped, moved to the left, stopped, move and stopped again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When looking with the binoculars we could notice a red ring.  When the red color vanished, we saw a dark disc.  The other two people got scared and went inside.  I stayed outside watching when three more lights appeared.  The last one looked bigger and when I tried to take a picture, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared in the sky at: more or less 65° NE and moved to the left. The last one moved farther north to more or less: 29° NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were seen at more or less 30° angle from our position and probably between 800 to 1500 feet high.  I got the feeling that they were camouflaging with the rest of the fireworks that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw five of these red balls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was 9:30 EST time and fireworks were being set off around town.  There were plenty of fireworks all around, but I looked out of the window and seen an orange/red ball of fire in the sky, sitting high above them.  It was slowly moving across the sky, almost like how the moon will follow you when you drive, but once we got about 5 miles away from it we could only see it if we looked back.  There was no noise and it was silent. No one sitting outside of their houses seemed to notice it being that they were looking in the other direction at fireworks.  There were four of us in the car who all seen it.  My husband tried to convince everyone that it was a Chinese candle balloon, but the funny thing was the last time we looked back at it before it was out of our view, you could see two planes flying towards it-all of which looked like ants in its giant comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d say the light could&#39;ve been at leas!t half the size of the moon.<n>

We have the intention of &#39;UFO spotting&#39; as a pleasant pastime, looking for what the general public may not be looking for up in the skies.  For the past 4 years, we have seen odd, unusual objects on the Independence Day evenings.  I have a good knowledge of aircraft night illumination, types of aircraft and do fly R/C aircraft, sometimes at night.  I used to live on the approach to Manchester Airport, when living in the UK, til 2007. My wife has a similar degree of discernment regarding known standard aerial objects, including satellites, stars and high altitude aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While there is the local Davis Field airport, air traffic is in the order of 1 or 2 light aircraft per day and perhaps a military or hospital helicopter on infrequent occasions.  Our skies are therefore relatively clean of commercial passenger aircraft, it being an uncommon sight to see even a contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting this year, 2012 - We set out at 21:20 and headed South approx 5 miles, away from the city of Muskogee, Oklahoma, where we live.  By 21:35 we were positioned in a pull off area on a dark road and looking North toward the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wind direction was SSW at 6mph, as checked on wunderground.com and remained similar all evening.   Such a fact may be important for considerations of the report, or those from others local to the area, if they are received.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the melee of firework activity, 2 groups of 2 red lights could be seen to be moving East to West at a distance of approx 3 miles distant.  The lights were tiny spots, slowly moving West and seperated constantly by a short distance, equating to around 20 lengths of object size.  We then saw 3 groups of the same type of lights moving from the West to the East, behaving in the same manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Speed of travel could be estimated anywhere from wind speed, to 50mph, depending on the actual distance of the objects, which is unknown.  Slow in any case and linear, without dramatic differences in direction of travel.  A slow climb was noticed with several groups of the lights. All objects &#39;floated&#39; along for 1/3rd the viewable sky, until they would disappear and all behaved in the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We decided to head North West, to see if we could find an origination point. My own thoughts were of Chinese lanterns, a candle inside a lightbox, suspended from a parachute or balloon.  Such a device could, feasibly be what we were watching, though wind direction would have to be changing and launch points.  However, my wife informed me that this tradition is not carried on in the United States, and especially during the drought conditions our area has been experiencing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at a veterinary clinic on Peak Boulevard and pulled in to the car park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over our heads we witnessed 2 of the orb lights at about 50ft distance from us.  They slowly made their way Northward, no sound, glowing a bright red.  Size is estimated to be anywhere from football sized to car length sized, it being quite difficult to discern physical distance from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We DO have video footage of that incident (uploaded to YouTube and not set to Public):<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3Jro3yEkvo<n> <n><n> <n><n> I apologize for the quality, but, it shows the distancing between 2 of the lights.  We intend to purchase a better night quality camera in the near future.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to head West on Peak Boulevard, past the casino and into the country, where city lights would not prohibit our view, in the hopes of again tracing any launch point of the objects. On stopping at another pull off area, we noted several groups of 2 orbs moving from another start location and then, a group of 5, closely spaced in an approximate diamond shape. We had been studying the sky behind us, moved back to face the original direction and saw the group of 5. It is unknown how they arrived in that placement or from which direction. Within 10 minutes, 2 more were seen in the sky, travelling from East to West - which completely defied the wind direction again and the previous emanation point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total was either 23 or 24 bright red glowing balls of light, in tandems or in a group of 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All aerial objects were sighted coming into the field of view, with none originating at ground level or from high altitude. Average flight height is deemed to be the height of firework bursts (200ft ?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orbs were seeimingly floating in toward the city of Muskogee from many different directions, during the 1 and a 1/2hr observation period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wind direction, being constant, removed personnal thoughts of balloon lanterns and hence is why we are posting this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and for reading our account.<n>

We parked in a church parking lot at the corner of Gurley Ave and Carroll. Many other people were parked here as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were waiting for the firework show to start, I noticed two glowing, red/orange, slow-moving orbs, or what I first thought were fireworks.  They resembled Chinese lanterns floating in the sky, IF they had been on fire.  I was thinking, &#34;Why aren&#39;t they racing upward to explode like they usually do?   Why are they so slow?&#34;  I asked my cousin, &#34;What ARE those!?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed they weren&#39;t going up, they were moving sideways, and I thought it was weird that they seemed to be &#34;caught in the wind&#34; and moving away from where the fireworks would be.  They were moving slowly to the Northwest, at approximately 20-30 mph.  Everyone around us was staring at them, trying to figure out what they were.  They were reminiscent of ta! il lights on a car, but far apart from each other.  Also, they were hovering rather low, which is the other reason I discerned they weren&#39;t fireworks.  Low, slow moving, and non-exploding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched them for no more than 5 minutes altogether.  I got impatient waiting for the fireworks to start and forgot all about them.  That is, until the next day.  My brother in law arrived at my house to pick up his kids and he sat down and said, &#34;I SAW something last night.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The kids were around so he was hesitant to go into detail at first but I instantly knew what he was talking about.  I told him to tell me what he saw, and he described EXACTLY what my cousin, my son, and I saw, and he lives at LEAST 30 minutes away from where we saw them.  And it was about the exact same time.<n>

Shortly before the fireworks began, I noticed to red-orange glowing lights in the distance.  I was about to brush them off as someone in the nearby neighborhood shooting off fireworks, until they continued to move closer to where we were standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mesmerized by them, I continued to stare, but managed to get a couple of quick photos with my cell phone.  They appeared further away than they actually were in the photo.  It would have been easy to dismiss these as Chinese paper lanterns, had they not been SO bright and moving sideways and not at an upward incline at all and it was not windy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned for two seconds to say something to my cousin, and when I looked back to where they were, they were completely gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two of us had both completely forgot about this within minutes, until the next day when her brother in-law came to pick up his children and mentioned he saw the same thing, too.  Only he was at least thirty minutes away in Garland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects we saw are what I am thoroughly convinced to be UFO&#39;s, especially after seeing DOZENS of descriptions from all over the country describing red-orange bright glowing balls moving across the sky the evening of the fourth.<n>

Periodically, I would start and stop the video to check the video quality.  In one sequence of film, are luminous spheres, modulating in color (red/green), and in a formation.  The video captured the objects until they suddenly vanish one, by one, into the sir.  The objects are consistent with objects imaged over the US Capitol Building July 16, 1952. This is most spectacular video!  It shows these objects leaving (ascending) from a river, based on the camera POV in regard to the monument.  The film analysis shows luminous spheres in flight, then suddenly vanishing into nothingness.  Camera recorded HD video which is very unusual and showing objects with uniform consistency cloaking (vanishing) from screen.<n>

It looking like a hanging ball with a glowing yellowish colored light on the bottom of it.  The light barley illuminated the bottom of the object which made it appear round in shape.  It did not seen very large perhaps big enough for 2 people to sit in???  It was very exciting and very clear it was not anything the general public would recognize as a man-made craft.<n>

We could tell right away, this was no firework or airplane. We watched in amazement for about 2 minutes until it just vanished. Also, this was the second time i saw this object in a year.  The first time i saw this fireball was around august 1st of 2011. And i was able to get 19 seconds of video on my iPhone.

Saw the first (and single) object moving slowly from north to south directly over our head.  At first thought it was a helicopter, but had an orange/red glow and no navigation lights and no sound.  Then thought it might be an airplane at high elevation catching the sun.  It moved south and then disappeared.  Thought it may have gone into the shadow of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps 10 minutes later saw two similar lights/objects moving from south to north and far to the south.  Very close together it seemed; and too close to each other to be airplanes.  They disappeared as they moved to the north.  Which seems odd if they were entering the earth’s shadow, as the first one disappeared as it was heading south.  There may have been one or two lights/objects off to the east at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then during the height of the Lake Union fireworks show about 15 minutes later there were numerous lights/objects (five?) far off to the east moving north to south, with two of the objects close together.  They disappeared as they moved slowly to the south, but did not disappear at the same time, and also did not disappear at the same latitude (so perhaps not due to the earth’s shadow).  All of the sightings lasted for perhaps 1 to 2 minutes before they would disappear.  Other than the two possible pairs of objects, they were not in any formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live outside of the city of Seattle but am tempted to head back tomorrow night, and it should be similar weather conditions, to see if this occurs again which may indicate that it is a normal occurrence of airplane reflections.  But that did not seem to be the case.<n>

It appeared to be on fire. It appeared to reach the point where we had observed the other object when it turned north and then faded away. When within a few minutes two more objects appeared traveling in the same direction when they seemed to reach the point of the other two objects they appeared to turn north and also fade away.  My wife suddenly said look and there was another object coming from due south heading north we watched as this object also reached the point as the previous objects and fade away.  When we turned around ther! e were two more coming from the south one appeared bigger and brighter than the other. I looked down for a moment and when I looked back up the smaller object had disappeared.  The brighter object flew directly overhead it was a bright orange but it appeared to be a bright red light rotating to top.  The object gave the apperance to being to fire.  These objects appeared from two different directions miles apart and within minutes of each other and all seemed to be under power and control.  They all reached the same point where they began to fade. away. All to these events were witnessed by myself my wife and son.<n>

It moved in small increments, back and forth, then moved quite far from where it started, then came back and moved away again.  There was no sound.  I thought it might be a blimp but moved too easily and quickly to be a blimp.  It went too far away to be a kite, besides, it was too close to the fireworks to be a kite.  Plus, when the show was over, it stayed in the general area for another 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Everyone sitting in the area observed it and speculated as to what it was.  When we finally got out of the traffic, it was still hovering in the sky.  I think if it was something connected with the fireworks, it would have turned off its lights and left the area, due to the price of fuel.<n>

We were viewing fireworks in a parking lot in the center of Durant, OK, on University St. and 19th Avenue.  I was facing southwest along with my family when my husband saw the first orb of the evening.  This was the one that came closest to us. (The weather was warm, sky was clear and there were no clouds in the sky whatsoever. When it got darker, around 9:00-10:30pm, we were able to see many constellations from the center of town). Close to dusk, approximately 8:40pm on July 4, 2012, we saw a bright orange orb-like object smoothly move across the sky from the south to the north.  The object slowly passed over us and with the contrast of the darker and lighter sky with the sunset, I saw what looked like a larger, dark portion on top of the orange circular light.  It traveled overhead for about one minute before completely disappearing and suddenly toward the! north/northwest.  However, as it traveled, the light flickered inconsistently, like a candle. It did not blink as an airplane or water tower light blinks, rhythmically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, we had not yet set up our video camera and tripod to catch this object.  We had seen similar objects the past three years on the 4th of July, so we decided to try and videotape this year.  As a result, we taped almost 30 minutes of footage of various orbs coming and going from 8:45pm-10:20pm.  While the camera is older and the footage is often shaky, the moon, buildings, fireworks, trees, and other structures can be seen.  Our five-year-old daughter also spotted some of the orbs. Most of the orbs seemed to be about the size of an aspirin or somewhat smaller from the distance we were located.  Some seemed further than others, but one thing was very clear – they were NOT fireworks, flares, or airplanes.  There is a small regional airport on the southeast side of town, however, I don’t think most private planes take off as quickly or in groups as these orbs did.  And, all of the orbs were identical in size, color, and flight pattern.  The only difference was the speed, some traveled a little more slowly than others but all headed from south to north/northeast or northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after our first sighting, we began to see one orange orb after another, sometimes two or four at a time, pass from lower in the horizon from south heading north/northwest and completely disappearing after 30 seconds to one minute.  They did not travel like an airplane would but rather seemed to be traveling much faster and in a linear fashion.  When more than one orb appeared at a time, they looked as if they were in a formation or following one another.  They all were light orange in color and flickered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was primarily facing southeast since most of the orbs seemed to originate from that destination just over the horizon.  Later in the evening, closer to 10pm, the orbs were further to the west of town but still originating from the south.  This also seemed to coincide with the firework activity.  Again, the orbs can be seen on the video, and they clearly are higher and further away than the fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer #2 – male, age 15  I saw from about 20 to 30 glowing orange lights most of them flying in the same direction I don’t know how often they came but it was mostly after a bunch of fireworks went off. They started at about 9 and they began to slow down as people stopped to do fireworks they seemed to be about the same size but some looked a lot closer than others; some also seemed to move faster or be brighter. The first object that I saw looked the nearest. The sun was still up but barely, you could see a dark irregularly shaped thing on top. It seemed to have some kind of hook around the light and looked like it was holding the light, the rest of the objects did not have this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other orbs would be there for about thirty seconds then at some point disappear with no trail behind it. Some looked red but would than turn orange but would become orange. They would also slowly ascend at different rates. There would also be multiple lights at the same time. They didn’t touch each other and I couldn’t tell if there was a shape to connect them.  The first object I saw came from the south of town but the majority came from the southeast. All of them looked to be going north, northeast but all coming from the south. They didn’t blink or dim at all. They were bright orange lights that would last longer than any of the fireworks and move in a small diagonal path ascending but slowly. I couldn’t tell how fast they were moving or the exact distance they were. The most I saw at one time was four and that’s when fireworks were the most active.  They were all silent. No sound could be heard but the highway and fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer #3 – male, age 42  Date: July 4, 2012: I was present at the location of the sightings primarily observing my two young children during the experience. I was also lighting some small fireworks for my kids. The first sighting this year was confusing to me because I could see it even though it was still rather light on the western horizon (we arrived early before people started lighting most of their luminescent fireworks). It was an ovular object that was black in contrast to the sky with an orange light on approximately the bottom quarter. It appeared very low on the horizon and I found it bizarre because it was so visible. I had seen the orange colored orbs on the two preceding 4th of July holidays; but, I had never seen the unlit black portion above the orange light. It floated across the sky, from south to north, without making a noise. I asked my wife and 15-year-old stepson what it was. We were all baffled because it was so, well, blatant. I tried to set up the camera in time to capture it! , but was unsuccessful.  I wasn’t set up for recording because it was still early in the evening. Our camera was set on autofocus (because I hadn’t read online recording guidelines prior to our first attempts at recording these objects), so I was unable to capture it on film before it traversed the full length of the horizon out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this, my focus was primarily on my children. We were in an empty parking lot in our rural town; but, I am very careful in keeping an eye on my children, especially with all of the fireworks that were being ignited around us. Durant, Oklahoma, has a city ordinance that allows the lighting of fireworks within city limits only on July 4th of each year. So, people really light a lot of fireworks in our town on this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That being said, since I have seen the orange orbs glide across the horizon for three consecutive years now, I was always looking around me to see if there were other orbs intermingled with the fireworks exploding all around us. I saw many. Some were very distant; others were much closer and clearer. My wife took over with the camera, and she and my stepson tried to capture as many of the orbs as possible on the 30 minute minidisc we had in our standard definition camera. I saw approximately 20 of these orbs myself. Most were on the eastern side of Durant city limits traveling south to north/northeast. A few appeared on the western side of town and seemed traveled south to north/northwest. The ones that were closest captured my attention the most. They appeared to be orange with a hint of red in them. The close ones also seemed to have a sort of halo or light haze around them that could not be captured by our outdated video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orbs seemed to be traveling solo, however, there were times when more than one was in view. Also, when viewed in the northern sky after they passed, I could sometimes see three to five at once before they disappeared out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few constants I wish to provide with regard to these sightings: The orbs were all very similar in color and shape and did not waiver on the vertical plane. Closer orbs traveled at a quicker pace than more distant orbs; but, they may have all been traveling at the same speed due to their relative distance. None of the orbs made any noise as they traveled, although the fireworks being discharged in their peripheral were making plenty of noise, which may have concealed noise if I take all possibilities into consideration. The frequency of their appearance seemed to coincide with the number of fireworks that were being discharged into the sky, which I personally interpreted as providing concealment or a form of camouflage for the objects. When we packed up to leave, there were very few fireworks still being discharged. There were also very few orbs in visible in the sky by the time we left correlating with this decrease.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an educated man.  I have attended 10 years of college and am, quite honestly, a skeptic. I seek data and quantitative evidence before I believe any hypotheses or theories regarding any phenomena (my motto is “show me your data”).  I am not by any stretch of the definition a conspiracy theorist, but rather a diligent and responsible observer of the world around me. I have tried to make sense of these sightings over the past three years using what I have learned in my education concerning astronomy and the other physical sciences. I have clearly ruled out these orbs as being airplanes as these objects did not have the typical light patterns, sounds, or smoke trails of private or passenger airliners. My best personal (and humble) hypothesis as  to their purpose (which goes beyond describing the tangible evidence before me) is that they are mapping the land as cartographers of sorts or perhaps scanning for minerals beneath the earth. But, that goes beyond the purpose of this ! report.<n>

It was coming from the South headed North.  As we watched it turned East and we watched as it got in the distance and faded away.  It was about as high as the tree tops and we saw no sign of any lights that would mark a plane or helecopter.  It made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor went in and I moved to my back yard to watch and again I saw a fire ball of Orange color following the same patn.

I was driving East on the Route 2 Shore-way, coming from Cleveland, OH going towards my home in Madison OH.  It was about 2:30 in the afternoon. (Route 2 runs along Lake Erie.) I noticed a huge oval cloud (kind of shaped like a mushroom without the stem) over the lake as if a storm were brewing.  It caught my eye because I noticed a small white orb/teardrop shape with a white trail dropping down out of the cloud, straight down into the lake, or what looked like the lake because it was so far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought I was seeing things and then another one dropped out of the cloud, straight down as the previous one had done, dropping into the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two more of these white orbs/teardrops followed one after the other.  I didn’t notice a splash because #1 I was driving on a crowded highway and #2 the cloud was far off, probably closer to Canada.!  The weather was hot and humid, but there were some storm clouds way out over Lake Erie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the orb/teardrop was (to me) about the size of a pencil tip, maybe a little bigger.  I had my windows up with the a/c set to 2 and therefore I have no idea if there was an accompanying noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 55-year old woman who doesn’t see things like this but I thought that it was odd enough that I should report it to someone just in case others saw the same thing I did.<n>

They did not appear to change speed or elevation, or their position in relation to each other. They moved across my field of view over the course of about 1-2 minutes.  I did not know how big they were so I could not judge how far away they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first object was sort of in the shape of an E with the E facing down at the ground.

It did not change orientation either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of the objects were the same color... I would describe it as a brushed stainless steel... there was no appearance of a polished finish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not behave like balloons.

There could have been more but we had a bunch of cars behind us honking to go and we had to go.  So we drove about 1/4 mile down the street to a round-a-bout where we turned around to go back and observe. We got back just in time to see the last few exit the atmosphere.  They were definitely intelligently navigated and looked nothing like a plane nor a helicopter or any other man made flying craft ive ever seen.  As we drove the 20 miles home we saw another one coming towards us as we were heading toward the freeway to get home and again at Trosper road in Tumwater the craft flew over us again t! his time headed towards Olympia.  These two craft were cruising at a low altitude it seemed. I know I&#39;ve seen other UFO&#39;s in my life, but never this many all at once.  Then when I got home I decided to search youtube to see if anybody video taped it and I found several videos of the exact same UFO&#39;s we saw.  I also found some similar videos from July 4th 2011.  I know what I saw and I know I&#39;m not the only one seeing these.<n>

The movements were synchronized<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Lights  Location: Warsaw, Poland, position: 52º12’23’’N,  21º00’53’’  E 3rd floor flat, west facing balcony.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date: 3 July 2012, time: 23.00-23:30 (GMT+2)  Description of the event I was in the flat and at about 23:00 hours I heard the sound of thunder. When I approached the balcony door to close it I could see lightning in the distance.  By chance I looked up and saw right above me in the sky a moving round white spot.  This light spot was moving with a constant speed in an anticlockwise direction along a circular path which was about 20º in diameter. It took about 20 seconds to complete one revolution. The centre of the circle was about 70º above the horizon.  The diameter of the light spot was about 2-3º, but it did not have clear edges.  The spot was not very bright but the light intensity was sufficient to see it clearly against a background of clouds which were at about 500-1000 m in altitude.  The spot’s light intensity distribution was not uniform but it had a bell like shape and its edges were blurred like car headlights in a dense fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that sometimes when a dark cloud formed which was below the normal cloud ceiling, the light spot was obstructed by or even disappeared behind it, meaning that the light originated from above the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the spot travelled along its circular path its shape changed depending on the clouds it passed through. The shape of the spot, which was normally round, could be oval or irregular with rays radiating from it. The radiating or branching rays were sometimes narrow and pointed.  These rays radiated in different directions, even up to 3-5º away from the centre of the spot.  However when the thickness of the clouds was uniform the shape returned to its circular form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few moments I noticed a second light spot which was very similar to the first. This second light spot also moved in a circular path which touched the first spots circular path (see Fig. 1). The second circular path had the same diameter as the first and was positioned to the right of the first circular path. Its centre was about 75º above the horizon meaning that the centres of both paths weren&#39;t in a horizontal plane.  The second spot was moving along its path in an anticlockwise direction with the same speed as the first one. Both lights met at the point where the two trajectories touched each other and at this point the lights overlapped in such a way that for a second only one spot was visible. This meant that the movement of both spots was synchronized for the duration of the observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the second light spot changed in a similar way to that of the first, but at any given moment in time the two shapes were not identical because the spots passed through different clouds. When the clouds were uniform both lights had a similar circular-Gaussian shape. The lights sometimes disappeared when they passed through very thick cloud and after a moment reappeared at the appropriate points on their paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the lights with some breaks for about 30 minutes.  Since nothing changed during this time I stopped observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Comment After analysis of the light spots I reached the conclusion that the sources of the lights had to be positioned in the clouds rather than above them. The source of the light would have had to have been in the shape of a ball sending rays in all directions and therefore the intensity of light viewed from underneath was Gaussian. If the source was above the clouds it would be difficult to explain the propagation of irregular rays from the spots in almost horizontal directions in the clouds. Also, the diameter of the spots would have had to have been much larger. If the source of light was above the clouds the light would have difficulty passing through it and generating a bright enough spot. This can be confirmed by the fact that when a dark cloud passed underneath, it completely obstructed the spots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fig. 1  Showing circular paths of moving light spots.<n>

The winds were calm, light and variable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed an orangish-red glow moving from left to right from my position along the 45th parallel, travelling south to north.  The object appeared below the clouds that were present; and it moved silently.  I estimate that it was approximately 5, 000 feet AGL.  Nevertheless, it was in between the ground and the clouds present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orangish-red orb was followed by 14 other objects that followed the exact same flight path as the previous one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all occurred just prior to the start of the firework show; and I observed two of the objects go black and I could see their outline in the sky.

It was gliding slowly, in a straight line, making no sound – flying in from the coast.  The bottom of the object had three large deep orange lights, spaced close together and non-blinking.  In the center of these lights was a wide beam of bright blue-white light (shaped like an inverted ice-cream cone), pointing toward ground.  After the radiant object turned off the cone-shaped beam, it continued to fly in the same straight line.  Then it stopped and hovered overhead a few seconds before ascending vertically into space.  My husband is a private pilot and estimates the object flew near 10,000 ft.

There were 7 bright orange lights in a loose V shape across the sky.If there were more, we could not see them because our building would have been blocking them from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving from the west to east at a steady pace. There was no sound from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they reached almost directly in front of and above us, one toward the north of the formation stopped and hovered.  One by one, they all got smaller and faded from view (like they were ascending quickly, maybe), and only the one hovering remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for a moment, and then it too got smaller and faded from view without moving position.  Within less than a minute, there were two planes in the sky, heading in the same general direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was th! at those planes were &#39;together&#39; because they were so close to each other in the sky.  One headed north and the other headed east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too dark to see what kind of planes they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange lights were much brighter than the planes but looked smaller from our viewpoint (maybe they were higher in the sky?), but seemed to be traveling at close to the same speed as the planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The planes were still in the sky, but almost gone, when we saw another orange light to the west. I ran into the house and grabbed the binoculars. When I returned, there was another one in the sky, both traveled in that same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking at them through the binoculars, I could see that they were pulsating in a steady rhythm from bright to brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not really see that without the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no detail that could be seen, just orange light.

As soon as the two craft came right above our car, they made a 90 degree turn north.  We pulled ahead and off the road and got out of the car to watch the crafts as they flew away.  At this time the man that lived in the farm house came up the same road from the east [opposite direction] riding his bicycle and i said to him hey  have you ever seen a UFO and he said no. Then i said well there are two right there and they just flew over your house.  I could tell he was amazed immediately as we were to what we were witnessing.  About 45 seconds later a third craft appeared,following the exact same path as the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 45 seconds later a fourth craft appeared also following the same paths as the first three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four crafts were identical, about the size of an automobile, 100 feet in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crafts were flying very slow, about 30 miles an hour. There was absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were shaped like you took 4 or 5 round spheres 5 feet in diameter and fastened them together. The shape as a whole was oval i would say.  Each sphere was equally lite with a beautiful orange light that was pulsating to a darker orange almost red.The crafts were pulsating like a heart beat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear not a cloud,95 degrees,no wind dead still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the crafts disappear straight to the north,never changing direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total time of the sighting was about 7 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first saw the crafts we thought they were military copters,that&#39;s the only crafts i have ever seen fly that low and in formation. This thought only lasted about 2 seconds.I don&#39;t know how, but you just know immediately what you are witnessing.I have a very good grasp on mechanical,electrical engineering and physics. This was the strangest thing i have ever seen in my life and i am 58 years old. These crafts were close,under perfect conditions to observe them and they broke all the rules of our world [as we know it].  I was always interested in UFO&#39;S and was always looking to see one, but never did.I pretty well thought they didn&#39;t exist,but now i know with out a doubt they are very real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seemed to me they are not flying, they just are there and move in any direction at any speed almost god like.Seemed like they are a living thing not a flying craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know for a fact this technology is hundreds of years ahead of conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional meat processor and own my own company.<n>

Because it is the day before Independence Day I was watching the numerous fireworks being launched from the surrounding neighborhood as my wife watered the garden around the side of our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, as I was staring into the northwest sky a bright white light surrounded by a thick red orb appeared in the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I was struck by its brilliance and believed it to be a new firework that was designed to hang in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately called me wife from around the house so she could see the display as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the glowing orb it began to move laterally across the sky and grow in intensity.  As it moved, my wife and I stood in awe and contemplated the possibilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving from west to east as I said: &#34;It can’t be a firework its moving laterally, it can’t be a flair because it has not gained or lost altitude.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object slowly stopped and made ! a sharp 90* turn heading north.  We both commented on the fact that it made no sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I believe my wife was a little freaked out and she refused to watch any more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching as the object slowly traveled north until it was obscured by my low view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that during the 2-3 minutes this event lasted almost no fireworks from the nearby area could be seen or heard going off, as if everyone else in the area was also fixated on the same phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps the most significant parts of this event for me was that the object flew to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a small airport in the town of Iron Mountain were we live, only a few miles from our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The air traffic here goes south or west (Milwaukee, Detroit, Chicago or Minneapolis).<n> <n><n> <n><n> North is Lake Superior and Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this were a man made aircraft of any sort it is the first I have seen or heard of flying on a northern  path like this object did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what else to say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a well educate! d and stable person living a domestic life in a small town and! now I h ave seen a UFO.<n>

We ended up West of Hwy. 167 just off 15th St. NW on Terrace Dr.  We parked on the hill and had a good view of the fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at that location at approx. 9:45pm, about 30 minutes before the fireworks started.   As we waited for the show to begin, we witnessed a small orange light liftoff in what appeared to be the vicinity of the airport, possibly a bit north of it and quite possibly farther off than we suspected.  It definitely was not a firework of any sort.  It kept the same constant brightness and size the entire time we watched it.  It rose slowly at first and at a point that was about even with our line of sight (we were about a hundred feet in elevation above the valley) it stopped and hovered for about 5 to 10 seconds. It then continued rising in elevation at a faster rate than before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within about 15 seconds it was very high in the sky, about 70 degrees in elevation.  At this point we lost sight of it, either it went out or entered into the cloud. I can&#39;t be sure which.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later, another light that looked exactly like the first one, was flying towards us.  This time it was coming in from the North.  I pointed it out to my wife and she also saw it.  Soon after this it seemed to stop forward motion and sort of hovered and went a bit higher at the same time, and a few seconds later either went out or went into the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time did we hear any sound from these objects.  There were many commercial planes flying over head heading East after having taken off from SeaTac and we saw one private plane, all of these had the normal lighting and we could hear each one of them, but not the curious orange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all these lights seemed to be pretty small and not that bright, and with all the fireworks going on I doubt anyone else saw these.  I also don&#39;t think I would class these as fireballs, like you talked about on C2C or Jeff Rense recently.<n>

It appeared just beyond Jennette’s Pier, which is at MP 16.5, moved slowly north and before it moved directly over, still a bit south of us, it appeared to go out to sea and fade away. A minute or so later another one appeared and followed the same pattern. There were several more after that, always following the same pattern. This happened more than one evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were silent and did not seem to be “fiery” – just silent, orange orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not certain of the date, but know it was the first week of July very close to the 4th of July.  I actually called Jennette’s Pier to see if they knew anything about it or if it had originated with them, but the man I spoke to said he had no idea what I was talking about.  Since it was so close to July 4th, at first we assumed it was some kind of fireworks display, but that was not the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beach was very crowded in the evenings so I am sure there were other witnesses.

It moved slowly from the west to the east, soundless and flickering.  At first I had thought that it might be a meteor but it was under the cloud cover and going about the speed compared to a larger jet at 30,000ft.  I first noticed it almost straight up and slightly south.  I called my wife out to see as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued on, total of 90-120seconds, I looked for the red,green and white lights usually found on aircraft and saw none.  To me it looked like what a campfire would look like from a distance, only flying.  As it descended off into the east, disappearing either into the cloud cover or just vanishing, my wife noted that it had split off into 2 balls and appeared to have something connecting them.  I had noticed that when closer it seemed to have an orb of some sort around it, but that could have been like what you would see around a fire, hazy kind of orb, not sure how to describe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live 10 miles from Seatac Int&#39;l Airport and 3 miles from the Renton Airport so we are not strangers to aircraft, shortly after this fireball disappeared, a jetliner crossed over head, above the cloud cover and I could hear it clearly.  As with the smaller craft, they can be heard for a time before and after visual contact is made.  This ball made NO sound at all.

I ran inside to grab my binoculars and by the time I got back outside, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then at approximately 0030h EST, my wife, my neighbor and I witnessed another orange-red object cut across the sky from east to west.  This was the exact same colour as the first, both travelling at a moderate speed, looking as if it was going up and fading out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 0100h EST as I was walking my dog to the field adjacent (to the west) to our building I looked to the north and noticed another ball coming up from the horizon heading south over top of where I was standing with my dog.  It was flying extremely low, approximately 10 meters from the ground.  As it cruised over me, it made no sound.  There was no heat emitted, it was clearly a triangular shape, illuminated by orange-red lights.  The entire object was glowing.  It appeared to be big enough to hold just one person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew over me I was flashing my flashlight at it, with no communicative response, however, it did slow down My dog was frozen in his spot and did not look away, as was I.  Once it was approximately 4 meters past us, it began to ascend in a diagonal motion towards the south.  It went through the clouds and I lost sight of it.  The whole experience lasted no more than 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light itself seemed unnatural... almost like it had a &amp;quot;thickness&amp;quot; to it if that makes any sense.  The sky was clear and we immediately checked our local news weather app on her phone and there were no storms anywhere near the area.  I immediately called my friend who was on the other side of town and before I could tell him anything he began describing the same thing only he claimed to have seen a blue spherical shape in the sky.  Upon arriving home I looked in the sky to find what appeared to be a contrail visible in the moonlight heading straight up and then suddenly making a hard ninety degree turn across the sky.  I should disclose that the road my wife and I were on is where a majority of the base gates are for Wright-Patterson AFB.<n>

It did not appear to burn out, but to travel further into the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then at 00:30h EST as we sat out with a neighbor, we saw a second light, almost identical, just not as bright was travelling westward at roughly the same speed as the first one.

Then, after a brief time, no more than two minutes, the light moved behind the clouds and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of these lights did not appear to have a steady beam, but fluttered slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I did not observe flashing lights from the wings so it couldnt be an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued to get closer and brighter, lights flickering, appeared to stop for around 15 seconds and we could see it was definitely not an airplane.

I must say I have heard and viewed of UFO footages during Rock Festivals and large gatherings worldwide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here’s my observations:<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the Tragically Hip Concert at Burl’s Creek Family Campground, we returned to camp to stay for the overnight camp. At about 11:45 pm  Sunday ,July 1st that late evening I witnessed three round brilliant orange UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two were much more distant- southward moving very slow - then a third one came across much closer above moving from the west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Passing the moon as a reference in the video clip taken  There is clear night night footage of it&#39;s orange glow   Within 5 seconds I immediately  pulled out my camera  to capture the moment on video mode.The characteristics were very strange in pulsation of brightness coming from this brilliant orange round object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Inside the UFO is best described  like it ‘ swirling ‘ motion inside the object. It  also moved fluid ~~ like - different. Really a extraordinary show in the sky for near five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please  note: That in fact. THIS THING had size to confirm not Chinese lanterns. No way indeed!  The actual size appeared 30 - 60 feet in diameter or LARGER  Moved like a &#39; wheel &#39; vertical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There must have been hundreds of witnesses that night at camp   You had to be there to see it FOR YOURSELF! It was so beautiful and very bizarre in nature.  What is perplexing about this incredible sighting witnessed is that  ‘ feeling ‘ I felt before the sighting event.  That something would appear either during the concert event or there after.  I suppose my prediction was indeed correct. This event has created great excitement for me and I beleived that there would be hundreds of other witnesses that night at camp.  The next morning I spoke with a Parks Ground keeper, he also witnessed the three.  First he thought they were helicopters, then he confirmed his belief that they were UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said it was the strangest thing he had seen in his life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As there was also reports coming out also from Barrie, Ontario July 1,2012.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Added to other locations in Ontario that evening PS I also believe that fireworks and Chinese Lanterns attract curious unknown seekers from the sky. Enjoy the photographic evidence!  *Still shot also attached Enjoy Summer 2012<n>

We have large picture windows which join at the NE corner of the house in our living room and we were each seated on either side of the end table with lamp situated in the corner of the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a large glowing yellow/orange kind of shield shaped object with a flame in the middle moving fairly swiftly and smoothly at tree level I jumped up to move quickly to the windows on the side of the house and and back patio windows to watch the object move past the side of our house toward Renton, which borders the west side and back of our property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to move evenly seeming self propelled until it was behind a tree in the back SE corner of our property and I could see it glowi! ng through the branches until it was gone from my sight.  I almost thought it had slowed, but I believe it was probably traveling a little more easterly away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had never seen anything like this before and was surprised at the size and how close to us it was traveling. I was most fearful of the flame in the middle if it were to be caught in the trees or even land and start a fire.  I told my husband that the only thing I could even imagine was like a hot air balloon, but there was no balloon you could see and it was not that large.  I have never seen a hot air balloon in this area and that time of night, the size and close proximity to the houses and trees made no sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to be maybe 3 to 4 feet tall give or take and I would estimate the angle when I point to where I first saw the object to where it disappeared to be about 165 degrees and the sighting lasted maybe 30 to 45 seconds.  The front of our home faces north possibly slightly northwest and the object was traveling from the north heading toward our home heading south probably slightly more southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a call that night that my brother-in-law had just taken his wife to the hospital emergency room on Sunday night at 10:36 pm,  so that was certainly weighting on our minds until we knew she would recover and then I began to think more about reporting what we saw shortly after the call so that it might be helpful in someway.  Hopefully I have given useful information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder if this could have been some kind of lantern launched inappropriately?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found her to be exceptionally eloquent and sober-minded.

This event lasted approximately 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having some flight experience, I found it odd that there was no sound for an object that was at such a low altitude.  The light emitted by this craft was red, and slightly pulsating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to ascertain any specific shape to the craft, but it was small.  There was no cloud cover to account for the immediate disappearance of the craft.  It did not change altitude during our sighting. It was not seen again after that.<n>

I was actually inside when I spotted this strange orb/light moving slowly across the sky and I immediately noticed the lack of any blinking, directional or running lights on this craft.  I ran outside to get better look and ruled out satalite as it was actually low in the sky, maybe 1/2 mile up.  It was changing, almost morphing orange/amber/yellow orb as best I can describe and the next thing I noticed was it was absolutely quiet, no motor, no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was traveling North to South at a slow speed in absolute straight line.  As I listened for any sound and tried to get a grip with what I was seeing, the de ep orange burning color turned more yellowish, then disapeared altogther in front of my eyes.  It did not shoot off up / down or other just disapeared.  At that p oint heard a jet sound which made no sense and then spotted a small, private size jet with all the &#34;normal&#34; lights a plane would have headed South to North as it approached the Wilkes Barre Airport to north of our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed this myself, however 5 minutes later my father walked in the door who had been taking home 2 friends and said to us, you will never believe what we just saw, and described the exact thing I had just seen.  I&#39;ve always been a believer but this was the first for sure sighting that was something not of this earth.  The technology to make that object move like that and almost change shape/color in front of me...sensing the oncoming jet and going stealth/dark...truely amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were listening to the music and waiting for the fire works to start.  The sky was clear except for the odd streak of cloud to the west. The sun was setting but it was still quite light out.  We were sitting on the south side of the lake facing north.  My husband was looking into the sky when i looked up to see what he was staring at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a radio tower in the distance.  A large bright orange light appeared out of nowhere behind it. The large orange light traveled south east in a straight line for quite a distance then completely disappeared.  This happened 3 times in total. Each time the light appeared in the approximately the same spot, traveled the same route and disappeared without a trace.  We wondered if this was the same light repeating its actions or three lights following sequence.  The bright orange light stayed consistent in color and brightness.<n>

I had two friends in the car with me and we were heading to Columbia, MO.  It was about 9:45 pm when all of a sudden we noticed that there were at least 12 red ball lights in the sky.  They spanned from south of I-70 to north of I-70. I was totally in awe and could not imagine what the sight might be.  I was traveling at about 70 mph and did not want to pull onto the shoulder of the road for fear of being hit.  As it was, I was driving erratically because I was so shaken by what I was seeing and wanted to continually be looking at the sky.  I immediately called a friend who lives in KC and told her to turn on the news and see if she might see something about the lights on the news.  It was then that she told me that there had been UFO sightings for the past month out in the Blue Springs, MO area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I began searching for information about what we saw and could not find anything. However now that I have been directed to your website I have seen several pictures of exactly what we saw which makes me at least feel like I am not losing my mind.   Just last night my husband and I witnessed another UFO and I will file a separate report on that one.<n>

At first we thought they were helicopters with search lights on, but as they went over our heads and they did not make any noise we thought differently.  The second pair of lights traveled in the same direction but this time they hovered over the park then vanished just below the big dipper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireworks ended and people were leaving the park.  We were discussing what we saw when a gray craft flew overhead and was very low to the ground (100 feet or so). It was difficult to discern its shape but the red light that circled the bottom of the craft clearly showed that the object was round.  It went over the trees and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of the crafts made any noise.<n>

OAKWOOD, HALL COUNTY Georgia JULY 1st.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Early morning of July 1, 2012, making the 6.4 mile normal route to my job i observed three bright white circular lights to the north of my east bound direction i was traveling.   A shower and breakfast thirty minuets earlier, had me wide awake and ready for my workday.  My first thought was that it must be stars still visable in newly lightening  dawn sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued  my normal route for another mile and could still see the three bright lights in the distance.  I then pulled into the almost empty wall mart shopping center parking lot and stopped at a point where I could view the lights with no obstructions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The viewpoint at this time looked as if the three lights were lining up perfectly in the distance in a verticle line.  It appeared as if they were becon lights on a new super tall cellular tower or something of that nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking for about thirty more seconds as i continued to observe the lights, that becon lights for towers are red and flash so that wasn&#39;t it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bright white lights dissappered all at once. I obsreved the skies in that direction for about three or four more minutes and saw nothing else, but the beautiful morning sky.  I have no idea what the objects are, or were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can honestly say it was very cool and made my day whatever it was.  I have lived in this area for my whole life and it was really unusual for the morning skies around here. I am forty one years old and am usually up early so it was really an event unlike I have ever observed.  Thank you<n>

This is why I called in the 2nd witness to come look at what I was seeing.  We proceeded to watch this light for another approx. 5-10 minutes as it hovered in the exact same spot.  The light then began to move very slowly in the direction of my house. I then proceeded to run outside to get a better look.  When I did all I could make out was a craft that had 3 lights moving quite the opposite as the previous craft in that it was moving slower in the air than anything I had ever seen.  The main emphasis was that it did not make one single sound as it flew right passed my house.  The craft looked to me as a triangular shaped ship about 3-4 times the size of a 747 passenger jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Many lie, some are truthful, you have to use discernment with them, that&#39;s why in our YouTube video&#39;s we put we neither endorse nor refute we just present their evidence.  Anyway a HUGE ORANGE ball lit up my back yard.  It was like a plasma ball and you could see them in it.  It was REALLY SCARY.  They came through the box.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We calmly walked into the house and I didn&#39;t use the box again for months.

In the same area (Sedro Woolley) just in a different spot. I didn&#39;t watch that one.<n>

At first glance we thought it was a star. But the color was not the same and it looked to be in line next to Venus.  Then it seamed to be moving closer to us. From southwest direction to North East direction downward towards us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came closer to us one orange light, became 2 lights, and it made no sound.  We could see it was just above the tree line and it stopped and hovered for about 5 minutes and again made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the lights went out.  And when it did we saw a greenish sort of glow and it then simply moved very slowly drifted East, above my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all knew this was a ufo and was seriously in a state of shock for all of us...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it moved back into a South East direction.  As it moved, it was as if it had a device that made it just disappear from the outside inward.  Like an invisible what some call a cloaking device.  this whole event took about 15 to 20 minutes as far as I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object pattern seamed move in a square pattern.  Nothing like what at least we know of, that could move like this.  The image is so imprinted in my mind where I had to draw it as to not to forget what I saw. I just keep thinking that I cannot believe I would of ever seen anything like this in my entire life. I,  my friend , and her date are still in shock, and it was so close to us. I felt as tho we were being observed. At that point I went straight into the house.  I am now petrified to even look up at the stars and feel the same. My friend feels the same.<n>
