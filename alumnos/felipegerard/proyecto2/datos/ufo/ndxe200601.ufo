I saw it as it looked almost level with the plane. To me there seemed to be a slight curving trajectory, but I believe that was an illusory affeft due to the flight plan of the plane. A treeline on the immediate horizon hid anything further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane was heading in an easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited to hear sounds or see lights of impact, but none came. There were no sounds during flight, and the light was not hazy or changing, nor did it flicker. I do not know if it landed or impacted the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Notice: Due to distance, the descriptions of relative position are biased in perspective. I cannot fully say that the light and plane were close at all, or even truly crossed paths. Non-converging paths can seem convergant from such a perspective over distance. I could not distinguish any 3D spatial relationship, only as a 2D p.o.v.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My sister lives in Kirkland WA,up the hill from Lake Washington. She lives in a townhome and her bedroom is on the ground level facing west towards the lake.  There is a grass lawn going out about 40 feet before hedges and trees.  Here is what she said happened: he dogs started barking frantically and the cat that had been sitting by the sliding door, was now running down the hallway. The louvers on the sliding door curtain were flowing back and forth due to the cat&#39;s hasty departure.  She went to the sliding door and looked out.  She saw blue flashes outside and heard muffled booms. She said she saw three separate blue lights, one after another, about the size of two basketballs.  The blue lights had white in the middle and they exploded in a muffled &#34;poof&#34; sort of sound.  There were 3 in a row and then nothing.  She said they were about 35 feet out from her door and about 8-10 feet in the air.  She has no idea what they were and talked to her neighbor during the next week.  He&#39;s a cop and he had gotten up to see the flashes and thought they were fireworks.  That week, there was an earthquake in South Whidbey and also the Everett area.  I was surmising that they were perhaps, &#34;earth lights.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the party who submitted the report.

This light was low and it shot up before a hill.  It was very strange, it looked like a shooting star, but changed directions rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure what it was and was mostly wondering if anyone else had seen or reported this?  There is an airport on the other side of the hill, but I have not seen a plane move that fast in the sky before?  I am mostly curious.<n>
1/31/06 00:00|Lake Havasu City|AZ|||Mystery Solved...?|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48942.html|6|ndxe200601| Mystery Solved...?<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple years ago (April 2002?), I reported strange sightings in Lake Havasu City, AZ.  I wrote about a bright amber light that &#34;pulsed&#34; and released flare-like objects.  Ever since I saw these objects (on several occasions) I was obsessed with finding out what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, I was looking through old NUFORC reports. There were several similiar reports coming out of Burbank, CA.  NUFORC stated the police officers in that area reported that the objects people were seeing were not UFOs, but mini home-made hot air balloons with some sort of pyrotechnic devices.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After doing some online searching, I learned about &#34;Fire Balloons&#34; &amp; found these two sites:  http://php.indiana.edu/%7Elrobins/candbal.htm (explains how a fire-balloon can let off sparks or bright flashes of light among other things)  http://www.overflite.com/index.html   This could very well be what I saw on in Lake Havasu City, AZ.  However, during the very last sighting of these objects I had, the objects faded to a pin-point of light and flew over the mountains. I know this could have been an illusion and it could have been me looking at the light burning out and it just *appeared* to be flying away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, as dissapointed as I am,  I just thought I would pass this along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Seemed to hang over the NW valley. These lights were lined up horizontally and moved together in a WSW direction. I and my neighbors observed these lights for seeral minutes then then just disappeared. The lights then reappeared 30 seconds later much farther away. At this time two of the lights were together some distance West of where they were. The third light reappeared at the same time to the North of its original sighting. These lights all appeared and dissapeared in synchronicity. This time we noticed the lights for @ 2 minutes, then they all moved to the SW for about 10 seconds and then Poof! they all disappeared again. I have really bad video footage that shows a minute or so of activity. These lights are very similar to lights I have recorded several months ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I was outside I observed what appeared to be a giant fireball in the North sky. It resembled what we see when the shuttle takes off from the space center, but was much brighter. It wasn&#39;t falling, it was heading North. I took out my binoculars and continued to observe the craft until it disappeared. I live about 50 miles from Macdill Airforce Base, so I am used to seeing jets flying through the air, but this did not resemble any trail left by a jet that I have seen before. The flame was much bigger and left no smoke. Did anyone else observe this object?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible contrail?  PD))<n>

We heard a low humming noise and clattering against all the windows of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked outside, and saw 20 or more tiny blue lights in the sky. We quickly picked up the video camera and began filming. The objects were very high up in the night sky, but were clearly not human, they moved freely in any direction, or they hovered together, one ontop of the other, a few miles apart in the sky. This continued for about an hour. We noticed the objects getting much larger, as they slowly lowered themselves to earth. We managed to get one or two close ups on video, but the quality was not the best. The ridge above the house, about 1 1/2 miles to the north began to emit a daylike glow. Most of the objects were no longer visible but the humming sound had become almost deafening. Suddenly the wind began to rip at the house, out of the north. the lights pulsated on the horizen and clouds of smoke appeared to rise up slowly from each light, there were about 6 lit up areas. I picked up the phone to call someone, but the line wasnt working , it was buzzing like it does when the tv has no channel on it. We leaned out the window to see better, and listen. We heard the most erie howl, not like any coyote we had ever heard, almost a siren, but not as perfect. They came from each lit up hilltop. They were followed by a loud bloodcurdling deep scream, definatly not human. It filled the entire valley, and what followed was odd for mid winter in canada, a warm strong breeze came from the north, almost hot, and it smelled like burning plastic, or somthing close to that. The sensor light outside kept coming on, and we heard crashing and banging against the house, scratching through the walls on every side. Neither one of us saw anything for sure but we both thought we saw a tall very pale figure, that had a humanlike shape, and glowing eyes, running across the driveway. Petrified, we shut ourselves in and listened intently. We looked out the window for a bit longer to see the smoke puff up from the lit up hilltops again. and than tiny blue lights like we had seen earlier, shot up qickly from them to an instant hover, and than began getting smaller as the flew higher into the sky, they remained visible for a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On my way back inside my house, I looked up in the sky because I heard an airplane. Above the airplane were 2 Bright orange Egg type of things to the left of the little dipper moving and a good speed in all directions, I couldn&#39;t believe it. I ran inside to get my brother to tell him, he didn&#39;t believe me but came out anyways. Once we both were outside, we looked up and noticed they were no moving to the right of the little dipper, at an unreal rate of speed, I mean like 10x faster than an airplane would, so he called up his friend Nate C. who then went outside to see what was going on. The objects then stopped moving and sort of hovered there for awhile, a few minutes pasted and all the sudden both started to drop, what looked like sparks, out of the bottom. Then a few more appeared out of no where and also started to drop out the mysterious sparks.  There were now 6 of the objects flying around in every direction, up, down, diagonal. I then called up my friend Adam B. and told him to go outside, He saw it also, we were tripping out, we couldn&#39;t believe what was going on, after awhile they each, one by one, slowly disappeared. After we got of the phone with eachother I went back inside. About 12:00 am I went back out and 2 more were there and 1 of the object started to drop the sparks out of it and both of the objects then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is 100% true, no lies, I couldn&#39;t believe it either. I&#39;m not crazy, I have 3 other witnesses that saw it at the same time I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

We were pretty acclimatized to the darkness and were able to see very well at this point.  My friend was looking slightly to the left of where the object appeared (if it was at 12 o&#39;clock, she was looking in the 10 o&#39;clock direction).  I was looking directly in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden this HUGE bright light just &#34;exploded&#34; in the sky right at treeline.  It was very bright and very intense, but there was no sound associated with it.  It was yellow-ish and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came back to the area about 40 minutes later after investigating surrounding areas with no luck.  I saw the flash a second time after spending another 5-10 minutes looking in the sky.  The second time it was a very quick flash of light...bright, but not as large, and above treeline a little farther up in the sky.<n>

I thought it was Mars and then the moon.   It wasn&#39;t far from us.  It was about 30 times the size of the moon.  It seemed as though it would collide into Earth.  (It was that close)  We could see half as it was in the horizon like the sun going down.  I was so busy and figured that I would here about it from TV or radio or newspaper.   I was so busy that I didn&#39;t even try to here from the media the next day.   So many people were driving.  I should have flagged people down or ran back to get my camera.

We were in the dept&#39;s six passenger pick-up truck, I was riding in the front passenger seat, another member was driving, and the third member was in the right rear passenger seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fire station fronts onto Third St.(Norhtwest), and as we left, we turned right onto Third St.(Northeast), and proceeded approximately 100 feet to the corner of Third St. and Railroad Av. At the corner, we turned right onto Railroad Av. (Southeast). As we got on Railroad Av., I noticed two aircraft with lights, travelling East at high altitude. It is common to see aircraft overhead here, most at high altitude. Military training flights are also common, at all altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the planes get farther away, I noticed a third light, approaching from the Southeast, and much lower in altitude. I at first thought that this was a military plane, with a light on or under the nose, there were no running lights or other lights visible. As we continued on Railroad Av.(Southeast) I could see lights from the Parker-Hannifin plant buildings on Tannery Road, as well as the lights on the plant&#39;s elevated water tank. I could also see the outlines of the mountins nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the approaching light, it did not cast a beam like a spot light or head lights on a vehicle.  It appeared to be round, and did not change in color or intensity.  The light continued in a straight line toward the Parker-Hannifin plant, and because the elevated water tank was plainly visible, I estimate it to have been at an altitude of 1000 feet or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were travelling on Railroad Av. at about 5 MPH, we had passed the corner of Fourth St. and were about halfway to the corner at Fifth St. where we would make a right turn.  At this point, I said out loud, &#34;What the Hell is that?&#34;  The driver asked what I was talking about, and put his foot on the brake, I pointed into the windshield and said &#34;That light&#34;.  As we got to the corner of Railroad Av. and Fourth St. the driver stopped, and I jumped out to see if I could hear plane engines.  Just as I got out of the truck, the light appeared to grow in diameter and intensity.  Before the driver and rear passenger could get out of the truck, the light just vanished, just like you flip off a light switch, it just was not there anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to stand in the street by the truck for acouple of minutes, looking for the light, a car came up Railroad Av. stopped and asked what we were looking at, when I told him that I did not know, both him and his passenger got out to look, but whatever it was, was gone.  There were aircraft seen at this time, headed West, and East, all at high altitudes   I am convinced that this was not a plane or helicopter.  As I said earlier, you can see aircraft over the town, day and night when the skies are clear, and hear them when it is overcast.  That evening, the sky was clear, with very few high, thin clouds, the stars were bright.  The temperature was in the mid thirties and there was no noticible wind.<n>

I thought it to be an airplane since it was in the direction of the airport, but then I saw another, and another, and another.  I ran inside to get my glasses and when I came outside I saw what was about 50 of these white figures in the sky.  It was a cloudy day so at times the clouds would come in and hide the figures from view but would appear again.  Gradually the figures started fading away until only 3 of these figures remained. They appeared to make a triangle in the sky (two of them linear and the other in front of them).  Then one of them proceeded to make movement towards the other ones, until they were all perfectly lined up.  Then it went back to its original point and again came back to make a straight line and then finally to its original point. Dark clouds once again came in hiding them from view and when the cloud gave an opening to the sky the objects were not visible anymore.<n>

The object was not exposed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the closest description, other than the dome was almost a little &#34;bell shaped&#34; as well, with the top being a little flatter.  With the sun hitting the object, it was a brilliant, shining silver (and was definitely not a hot air balloon).<n>

Jan. 28 2006|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48931.html|22|ndxe200601| Low flying angular object seen near Hollis Crossroads. Heflin, Alabama. Jan. 28 2006<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and three friends were on our way to Anniston, Alabama in two seperate vehicles. It was around 6 and it was dusk. There was still light in the sky and we could see an outline of the object we saw soon after. We had just turned at Hollis Crossroads and were driving down the road when we saw what was either a very low flying object, or an enormous object at a higher altitude. It was trianglular with a flashing green light on it. It moved slowly, or slower than a plane would, across our field of vision, which was the windshield since it was almost directly above us.  There were trees on either side of the road and it took up most of what part of the sky we could see. We called our friends in the other vehicle to ask them if they saw it, and they said they had and described it like we did. They were about 30 seconds in front of us and said they saw it going the other direction, as if it made a loop or a circle. There wasn&#39;t any airfield near by that we know about and it didn&#39;t look like any plane we had ever seen. If it was an airplane, it would have to be either landing, taking off, flying way too low, or gigantic. When we arrived at school the following Monday we found that 1 or 2 other people had seen the same thing at the same location. It was unlike anything we had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a single slow moving oval UFO moving North towards Cairo, Illinois. The speed was compared to an airliner at high altitude. There were two lanes of white clouds ahead of this object. The clearly defined oval edges had a cloud like reflective color. This craft moved into the first lane of clouds. Thinking it would appear in seconds into the open space between the clouds. It did not do so, and I did watch that area for some minutes. Nothing!  Two weeks later a Sacramento, California Open Lines caller to Coast to Coast AM&#39;s George Noory. Described the exact oval shaped UFO with a cloud like texture for it&#39;s color!  CJW<n>

They appear to be stars at first and once you lock your vision on the star it begins to move. Sometimes I see one &#34;star&#34; move and pass another &#34;star&#34; and then that one starts moving also...?! They always fly VERY high and fly out into space until the light dims out. From comparing &#39;high flying alltitude&#39; planes I would guess they are moving atleast 1000-2000 mph.  there is also a telepathic connection between the lights and myself before and during the sightings. I believe these sighting are end times signs in the &#34;heavens&#34; and all of you who read this please take time and look into the sky and ask them directly....they are up there, have patience and you will see them.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

1/28/06 03:00|Hemet|CA|Disk|1 minute|((POSSIBLE HOAX))  ufo in the orange groves.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48993.html|25|ndxe200601| ufo in the orange groves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened last saturday night when I and 4 of my friends were trying to cause some mischief in our creative new ways. Now don&#39;t come to the conclusion that we are a group of jug heads and half-retarded socialites, we are actually rather prominent students, 2 of them are music majors home for the weekend. Anywho, we were &#34;yarning&#34;(taking yarn and wrapping it around desired objects.) a bridge above an aqueduct so that if anyone drove by they would run right into it, we did it so it was a wall, not too dangerous but itll scare the hell out of you. So we hide in the orange groves and wait for someone to drive by, low and behold its a cop. So he slams on the brakes and starts searching and what we believe to be calling in other units. We take off backwards in the groves for about an eigth of a mile so we can cross the aqueduct without the cop seeing us, so we can enter a much larger feild of orange groves to get in the clear. The plan is to make a full 2 mile flank to get to our vehicles which we parked purposly away from the scene. So as we are running in this very very large grove, a mild and warm light starts up in the direction we were running in, so we make a turn, scared as hell it was a cop car in the groves or something(by the way this is what we live for, we do it for the rush). We had to turn in the wrong direction because if we hit the road at that time we would be seen. So we then run into a large aqueduct and head down that for a couple minutes, but the light reappeared to the right and up ahead of us. We felt very exposed so we decided to bunker down in the groves on the opposite side of the light. Once in the groves we watched as the light then started to rise in the air, and I thought we were screwed that they called in a helicopter, and being they have the large lights and night vision, we would surely get caught. We didnt hear any propellers though, so we were confused, and thought it might be a guy with a lantern climbing up these really tall windmills and towers that help to keep the tree&#39;s from freezing in the winter, what he was doing at three in the morning in the warmest january we could remember we hadn&#39;t a clue. Then the light started towards us left, and very slowly it seemed, so now we were pretty much crapping our pants. as it got a little closer, maybe half a mile to a quarter mile away it took shaper. We could see that it had a colored tinge to its outside(not the part that held the light) but what color im not very sure, I say it was more of a burnt orange to a redish gray, everyone else has their own color interpretations so who knows. The shape was hard to tell because the light on it was so bright it hid the parts further from it. This thing kept going without regard to us, so when it got to where it seemed it was leaving our presence we booked it to the road faster than I think any of us have ever ran in our lives, made it to our cars, the cop was gone, the yarn was cutt, and we then went to denny&#39;s and talked it over for about an hour. We were so shacky we were afraid to drive home, especially me seeing as i lived only maybe 2 miles linear from where this happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax, we suspect.

We felt so scary that we turned off our car and we stayed to the dark, thinking that it is something hostile from Turkey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was moving to our side we could see that it had a strange shape of something like a diamond, and their lights were flashing around it.  It came right above of us and stoped for about two minutes. We were terrified.  We could listen no sound, but the lights were so stronge that we couldn’t hold our eyes open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sydenly it landed next to us and all the lights turned off. We felt deezy, our head was too close to be exploded and we swa about eleven &#34;people&#34; walking near our car. I stepped out of the car and took my weapon with me. But my head pane became stronger, so I threw dwon the gun. Then I heard one of the &#34;thing&#34; talking to me.  It was like us, it had hair, it was two meters tall and its eyes were covered by something like black eye-glasses. It seemed strong and grey. Its head was bigger and its hands had two thumbs and six fingers. It spoke to me in a language like anciend greek and It was like singing to me. The only thing that I underestood was that they came to help humanity, and take in exchange some materialw that we can not use as fuels. Then they left, with no sound, and their lights were turned on as soon as they left the ground. Nobody has learned anything. We afraid to talk about it.

But I thought something was different. It was flying lower than the other planes in the night sky, and it must have been going perfectly straight away from us because it was getting smaller and moving closer to the horizon. But the strange thing about it was that it had a complete row of white lights from wing to wing if it were a plane. The other planes in the sky didn&#39;t have that. The object did also have 2 lights blinking from the bottom of the craft. One light was for sure red the other I am not sure if it were red or a different color. There was no noise, but I didn&#39;t hear any noise from the other airplanes either. Maybe this was an airplane, but it was lower than the rest and there was no noise, and I don&#39;t know if there is an airplane out there that has white lights all across the width of it like that. The row of white lights were about 5 to 7 lights. I tried to count them but I ran in the house to get my Husband and by the time I got back out, It was further away and I couldn&#39;t get a good count. My 2 daughters, my husband and I saw this. The object was probably moving at the regular speed of an air plane. I would just like to know if there is an airplane out there that has lights that would look like this from the rear, and if anyone else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was observed after going outside to get my dog who had steadily been barking for several minutes just after sunset.  Also I noted several other dogs in the area were barking, not in a threatened manner, but more as if they were just disturbed. My partner also  saw the cloud, but returned inside to watch a movie, while I watched the cloud for about 1.5 hours.  I looked above me to see other clouds in the sky were moving, all except that cloud, which never moved.  The light seemed to go around in a circular pattern within the cloud, almost a teal color.  I did finally get into my car about 8:40 pm and drove around Mills Mountain to get a different vantage point.  I never did however.  The light was gone when I got home and I noted that all the dogs I heard barking in the area had stopped barking.  The cloud was, however, still visible without lights, and had changed into a sort of fog, softer looking.  I estimate that this cloud was from 1-3 miles from my home, about 10 degrees above Mills Mountain and was more horizontal in shape.  I would estimate its size, maybe the size of a football stadium, hard to say though. I live in a rural area just west of Little Rock on 6 acres.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had been looking at Orion (it was a very clear night) and noticed that the object was sustantially brighter than other stars.  My wife also noticed it when she came outside.  Then our two friends also started studying it.  We weren&#39;t sure if it was moving, but we all watched it for about a minute or two and realized that it was heading towards us.  From that point of view, it just appeared to be three very bright lights.  I went inside for my binoculars and by the time I got back downstairs, they were yelling that it was over the house.  I went outside and my friend said it seemed to be diamond-shaped.  I focused my binoculars on it and I could make out four bright lights, one at each corner (or possibly several small lights at each corner).  It was definitely diamond-shaped, I could just make out it&#39;s outline, but I couldn&#39;t see any fine details such as texture or any contours on its belly.  As it continued moving, one of  the lights dimmed and then was no longer visible (I assume they were directional lights, maybe), but we could still see the other three.  It continued moving in a NNW direction until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event happened over a time period of about 10 minutes.  It was never really directly over our house, but I would estimate that it passed over the the small town of Espy, through my &#34;neighborhood&#34; and continued over the I-80/Rt 487 interchange.  I can not say for sure, but it seemed like it was only several hundred feet off the ground at the most.  I could not give a good estimate of its size.  I did not notice it making any sound during this time, but afterwards, my friend said he thought he remembered hearing a humming sound.  If its direction remained constant, I would estimate that it came from near Mainville and continued on towards Millville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day, a coworker of mine told me that he and his wife witnessed a bright flash in the sky near Millville that same night at about 9:00 PM (two hours earlier than my experience).  He had no explanation for the flash, but they both thought it seemed strange at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

In the southern sky at about a 45 degree angle, around 6:30, I saw a large, bright, globe shape.  To describe the size, take a 10 or 12 inch softball and hold it out at arms length, that’s about how big it appeared.  It seemed very far away.  My first reaction was, boy that’s an awful big star. Then I thought, it’s probably a planet, but they usually say something on the news.... About the time that thought passed, the sphere, started to get smaller; as if it were moving directly away from me.  Then it was out of sight.  This whole process took less than a few minutes.

There was also a fire ball tail taveling behind it. The occurance happened and 1am and it lasted until 3:05 am. It moved north towards Branch, MI. It would disappear andten reappear periodically. Almost as ifit was landing. Then it flew off and disappeared in the fire ball behind it. It seemed very  close to the ground and kept getting closer and closer. The lights would change colors and blink as if they were sending us a sign or trying to communicate with others.<n>

The light then climbed quickly in altitude and fell in what looked as if it was a fireball. We were unable to locate the site it dissapeared to.We think this could have been a plane crash, as the wind was exceptionally strong tonite. From that period until about 1230AM, we heard and witnessed lowflying jets in the area going unusually slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 9:30 in the evening on Jan. 25th, 2006 in Centralia IL 62801 - I did not hear any news on the radio or tv and I was alone - the object was very low. It was very cold in the low 30s or high 20s so maybe I was the only one to see it but for the first time in my 60 years I did indeed see a UFO. Just before I noticed it coming from the southeast every dog in the neighborhood was howling and when it fadded out they stopped. Is there any way that I could find out if anyone else saw this?<n>

My sister looked up and saw it too!!  We were both amazed!  it was very unusual.  There were airplanes that passed over us that night, but none were that high or moved that fast.

Sometimes, they can appear stationary when they are headed straight towards you.  There were several other aircraft in other parts of the sky, all clearly moving in various directions. But this light remained stationary in relation to the moon, which was visible to the east.  I and my passengers coud see it all the way into the Washington DC area.  It seemed much too bright and large to be a star or planet, but I didn&#39;t really give it much more thought.  However, this morning, same time, same route, it was there again.  The moon was lower in the sky than it was two days ago, but the light was in the same place.  This time, I paid more attention to it.  While I waited at the commuter lot, I watched this light closely.  Ever so often, it seemed to move up, down, and side to side, very slightly, and very rapidly. I guess you&#39;d call it a barely discernable wobble.  Coincidentally, one of the riders from two days before got in, and I called his attention to the light.  As we sat waiting for another rider, we both watched it, and he observed it wobble.  I&#39;ve seen bright lights in the sky before, and never really thought much about it. But the &#34;wobble factor&#34; of this one really has me wondering.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The other witness and I were deep in the woods camping, we were away from the fire gathering wood when we heard a high pitch noise such as a tea pot going off, we looked over and there it was hovering and slighty revolving, and of course it was night time so it appeared to be glowing, when we came upon it, it started to revolve faster and faster and get louder and louder, then it just appeared to fold into itself, and the light it had given off slowly dissapated. this all took place at about 2 in the morning.  the other witness and i sprinted back to the campsite through the woods and told the others, who were skeptical even though we were clearly shaken.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moments after I sat down on my stoop I noticed a faint shimmer of light at about a forty-five degree angle from the horizon immediatly infront of my position. After focusing directly on the object i realized that it was not a star or satelite. I sat staring for probably thirty seconds when i actually realized what i was seeing. I stood up and as I did a second craft came into my field of vision and literally chased the first object away. It seemed like where the first object was located was less than a mile from my house. It also seemed like something fell off of both the first and second objects, possibly landing in the golf course in my neighborhood.I then stood for a few minutes, finished my smoke, then went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There is a high hill directly behind the house.  I saw a glow at the tree line, the tops of the trees lit up.  Then a line of lights in a row, rose in an arc, maybe 9 or 10 of them.  They were orange, bright orange with a steady glow, not pulsating.  They were bigger than Venus and brighter.  Maybe like hand-held spot lights.  They illuminated the tree line. Moving not too rapid.  Moving from left to right.  The  formation slowly reveled itself. Looked like something big in that direction.  It looked like the leading edge of a solid object, with more hidden down below.  I thought, &#34;I’ve got time (to get to the back door)&#34; and jumped up and ran to the back door.  By the time I got out there, they had slid down below the hill.   I could still see a glow.  At the top of the hill, the glow dissipated.  I called my wife, but by the time she got there they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phase#2: My wife and I saw this.  Over the hill to the North there were weird looking strobing lights.  They were white.  I saw at least three, and they were set to form triangles in groups of three.  Three with three lights each.  These were a little dimmer than the string of lights.  A real fast strobe, a series of fast flickers, then nothing, then fast flickers, then nothing.  They all strobed at the same time.  The size of the clusters, each triangle of three lights was maybe like a quarter held at arm’s length.  Larger than a dime.  A friend told me he saw jet fighters come up from the South, slightly before 6:30.  They were in formation, flying fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report taken by Lou Ashby for the Missouri Investigators Group  http://ufomig.bravehost.com    B.

I was sleeping outside behind the house with some friends in a tent.  The craft was shaped like a half moon (half oval) with the flat part pointing toward the top left from where I was sitting.  I was sitting in the tent watching it through the window with my friend Simone.  The craft blended with the night sky but was a bit brighter than the grey of the sky.  It had small lights all over the surface of the craft.  The craft looked like it was probably very big but far away and was well above the trees.  The lights were white and they were blinking on and off.  I was looking in a westward direction.  I could not see the moon in my view, as it was to the east.  The outside temperature was about 30 degrees celcius. There were no clouds in the sky at the time.  The craft was stationary for about the first 10 minutes and then it moved slowly upwards until I couldn&#39;t see it through the window of the tent anymore.  I probably watched it for about 20 minutes until it went out of sight.  I was not afraid, but fascinated. Soon afterwards, I went to sleep as it was about 3:00 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Exactly like what was reported in 2003 in Snohomish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First let me start by saying that another post that occured on 1/9/2003 is describing EXACT what we saw!  We have seen this object twice this month- 1/8/2006 and now most recently 1/24/2006. We saw it both times at S-SW from Stanwood..that would put it over north Everett or west Marysville (Snohomish County, WA).  It appears to be a bright light, making one think it&#39;s just a really bright star, but it was too bright.  Just when we are arguing w/ourselves, the object moved.  It would just &#34;hoover&#34; in the same spot and then would shoot off the to right, then come back to center and go to the left.  It had lights that were twinkling and they would get brighter as it was about to move in a direction.  Red blinking lights were spotted occasionally..but it was too far away to be clearly seen, we thought it resembled a &#34;V&#34; like shape. We thought- helicopter, but there was no noise on either occasion.  Then within 1/2 hour two planes passed the object and we watched totally fansinated because the &#34;object&#34; disappered.  No lights were seen when the planes approached the area of the &#34;object.&#34; After the planes passed the object reappeared and went about it&#39;s &#34;searching&#34; or &#34;scanning&#34; like manuevers.  Last night we noticed that the object made circular motions very quickly and that we had not noticed before, as well as little &#34;U&#34; shaped motions to the left and right.  The thing that is interesting is that this sigthing lasted (on BOTH occasions) for OVER 1 hour periods of time and relatively the same time and same location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just want the person who reported the first one over Snohomish in 2003- that we saw the same thing..TWICE now- several years later.  Not sure what it was..but we are sure of what it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The night was clear with little to no wind. As I glanced up (toward the south) I noticed flashes of light near Sirius. I thought it was odd because aircraft don&#39;t fly that close together unless they are military. As I looked closer, I noticed that the flashes were not moving and not consistant like aircraft lights. Instead it was as if they were &#34;popping&#34; all around Sirius. There were very faint but observable from my vantage point even with the light pollution from the city. I am also sure I saw some sort of thin green/blue light sreak near the flashes. After 2-3 minutes of watching and not believeing what I was seeing I woke up my friend and asked them them to tell me what she saw. She said, &#34;I see little flashes of light around that star. What is that?&#34;  I swear the first thing I thought of was some kind of battle going on. Did anyone else see this?<n>

As usual there was nothing to see because I live in a quiet street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I observed was a bright white light in the sky behind the trees of my neighbor who lives on a corner lot across from me to the right side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was nothing unusual because I see those lights often from planes who fly over my neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while though I noticed that the light was not moving at all and I found that pretty strange.  To have a better look at it I stepped outside.My front door is close to the window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing that I noticed was that the light had disappeared and to my utter amazement from that same place where that light had been a very strange flying object flew in my direction.  It was a very dark or black rectangle platform It was not completely horizontal but looked a bit like a slide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On top were 12 orange and green round lights which looked a bit dim,6 on the left and 6 on the right.The lights were not blinking or flashing.  It was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed was medium slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew then over my house and I could see the underside.  It just looked like a black surface. Up front there was something that looked like an opening of some sort but it was not clear to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to the backyard but by then  I saw that it was disappearing behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea how far up this object was.It was not too high or too low.  The only height I can compare it with are the jets coming from Newark Airport about 35 or 40 miles from here.  When they fly over they are still low enough to been seen clearly and the height of this rectangle reminded me of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so excited and curious.!! I still am.!!<n>

But, I have not heard of any plane crash or any planes missing or lost.  And this would have to have been a large aircraft.  There is a flight path that goes over her property, but there was no noise what so ever.  This is farm country with no street or city noises and planes are definitely heard before they are seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still daylight and the lights I saw were bright white or even silver and completely round and crystal clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mentioned this to my friend last night (1/24) and she stated that she also saw what I saw.  She said that she saw a red light, which I did not see.  She did agree that there was no noise and her first thought was a plane crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning (1/25/07) on her way to work around 6:00 am she again saw lights appear and then disappear quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She is an ER nurse and I am an office manager for doctors.  We both feel that what we saw was real, but we would like to find someone else who also saw this.  There have not been any reports in the media.<n>

The base is on a plateau overlooking several small towns and a few other small Forward Operating Bases.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking out to the northeast, (where we have seen many other sightings as another I described earlier), I noticed several small beams of light barely noticeable by the naked eye.  We are aware of what military/insurgent operations in the area and what types of signs might be present.  Looking the night vision and heat sensitive optics, we could see them.  With the heat-sensitive optics, not as much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and the fellow Marine tried to shrug it off as just lights placed by locals or even coalition forces that perhaps we were not aware of.  But through night vision, the beams appeared to go up to an extremely high altitude, and near the base had a glow, as noted vaguely through heat-sensitive optics.  There were two-four beams at any given time over the early hours of the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we had to stay aware of base security, we couldn&#39;t focus completely on these but they were intriguing.  I&#39;m not placing the fact there could be a largely logical reason for these, but it felt weird, and the beams of light had weird characteristics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was months ago and I have just found this site, and it&#39;s hard to recall all the details, but I do know that they faded sometimes, and would come back brightly at times.  This was only really visible through night vision equipment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And the areas that the beam on the ground was focused gave off heat and a bright glow, and was in areas not completely populated. The area is not like Baghdad, it is mainly vast desert and spotted farmlands and towns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was very bizarre to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

1/21/06 22:00|Pe Ell|WA|Unknown|25 minutes|Brilliant blue light hovers and disappears near small forest town|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54718.html|70|ndxe200601| Brilliant blue light hovers and disappears near small forest town<n> <n><n> <n><n> While working in the industrial timber land surrounding Pe Ell, Washington, myself and another co-worker were sitting on logging landings at about 1500&#39; looking for illegal activity on the timberland.  At about 22:00 hours, I observed a blue, pulsing light begin to emit from the forest floor about 7 miles to my northeast, northeast of the town of Pe Ell.  The light was low in intensity at first.  However, the light then lifted off the ground to an alititude of about 600 feet off the forest floor.  The light it was emitting became very brilliant and lit up a section of the forest below it in excess of .5-1 square mile.  Using my binoculars, I could not make out what the light was being emitted by.  The light faded from bright to dark, then back again.  Then, the light simply stopped.  Overall, the event lasted about 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not say anything over the radio to the other workers in the area.  Soon, another worker asked if anyone else had seen the blue light.  I answered up and we skeptically compared notes.  We had observed the same event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fifteen minutes later, or around that amount of time, the light reappered in the sky and again began to flash a high intensity blue light.  The light then moved quickly to the forest floor and through the trees the blue light could be seen, pulsing an amazing blue/white color.  The light again disappeared after about 15 seconds.  The other worker again witnessed the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another 5-10 minutes went by and the light returned in the trees, although much dimmer this time.  The light began to gain altitude, to about 1000 feet.  The light flashed, then circled up into the night sky, flashed again, and was gone.  The light circled counter-clockwise as it ascended.  None of the other workers had seen the light and the two of us that did see the light have been taunted since, albeit very friendly, about how we must have been on some type of illicit drug that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days later, while stopping to get gas in the town of Pe Ell, I walked into the local convenience store.  I struck up a conversation with the attendant and she told me the following, regarding some type of search and rescue operation: The night before, a hunter, in the woods south of Pe Ell, observed what he thought was a meteor hit the ground near his location.  The meteor was not moving very fast as it descended.  It hit the ground and began to emit a blue light.  He got closer and the object began to flash a blue color.  He left the area and called 911.  Two deputies arrived, took his story, and proceeded to the area.  They assessed the situation and called for backup after observing the flashing blue light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend of mine called the dispatch center and asked what was going on.  They advised a plane had crashed outside of Pe Ell, but they were very vague about it.  Some type of search and rescue operation was underway.  Access up the logging road was restricted to police only.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/21/06 21:45|Dickens|TX|Other|5 seconds|Small football-shaped  object travels silently over neighborhood in Dickens, Texas.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48795.html|71|ndxe200601| Small football-shaped  object travels silently over neighborhood in Dickens, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside when I realized that I had forgotten a blanket on our clothes line. Since our neighbor&#39;s dogs were barking I decided to wait outside long enough to see what was disturbing them.  At this point, I was not certain what direction the dogs were barking, and if they might be barking at me or something else.  I sat down on the ground so the dogs could not see me.  When the dogs stopped barking, I continued to listen for about three more minutes.  When I heard nothing unusual, I decided to go back inside the house.  As I started to sit up, I noticed a strange brown-gold light (football-shaped) off to my right (north) side. There is no light source in this area so I wondered where the light had come from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each property lot is 150 feet wide and the object was above the south quarter of the third lot to the north.  I was in the north half of the first lot to the south, and there was one full lot between us---so the object approximately 300 feet to the north of me.  The object appeared to be moving at an approximate height of about 25-30 feet above the ground.  It was above the roofline of the furthest neighbor&#39;s house north, yet still under the treetops of the trees located in the lot to the west and north-west.  The trees, a mixture of mesquites and elm, range in height from approximately 6-50 or so feet tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object traveled very slowly, and without any sound, from east to the west.  The brown-gold light appeared to be some form of contained light source, as thought the light was reflecting inside a semi-transparent barrier with very little exterior illumination. The object did not light up the neighboring houses, the sky above it, or the ground below it. The light from my vantage point, appeared to be about half the size of a football held at arms length of 30 inches. [My closest night time “guestimation” is that the object was under ten feet in diameter.]  The object continued to travel horizontally and did fluctuate in height, speed, or direction of travel. I watched the light for approximately 5 seconds before it blinked out. As it blinked out, from light to totally dark, I noticed a slightly yellowish colored light at the east (back) side of the object like an arc of electricity sparking in a line from the middle south (left) side to the middle north (right) side. There was still no sound. I continued to watch to see if the object had continued to travel along the same path but it never passed in front of the trees to the west or north-west. Since it was dark outside and lightly overcast, I was not able to determine if the object had ascended up and out of my line of sight, or if it was still in the same spot and just not visible in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly before sighting this object, it sprinkled a few drops of rain and several bits of sleet. I had reached out to catch a piece of sleet to see how dense the ice was and to my surprise I drew back pieces of a reddish-orange particle that looked like tiny dried tree buds. The objects were not cold to the touch nor were they moist. They were crisp when rolled between the fingers and brittle. I was unable to see if there were similar objects falling further into the yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were due to receive scattered rain showers mixed with sleet and snow some time after midnight. There was no lightening in the area during this incident and there was no perceptible electricity in the air. It was partly cloudy and had sprinkled earlier but there was no precipitation at the time of the incident. There was a light wind from the ENE at about 6 mph. The temperature was 44 degrees F and we were expecting a night time low of 32 degrees. The humidity was 49% with a dew point of 25 degrees and a barometric pressure of 30.26 inches steady with a visibility of 10.0 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an end note: The neighbors dogs to the west had been barking as though agitated for nearly a quarter hour before this incident. My dog went outside with me and she usually ingnores the neighbor&#39;s dogs, but she appeared to watch to see what the neighboring dogs were barking at. My dog normally likes to romp in the dark and pick up sticks to encourage me to chase her but she never left my side. She never appeared fearful or agitated but she did not hesitate to come back inside the house with me.<n>

I enjoy watching thunderstorm so I am quite aware of how they behave. Initially the flash behind this cloud looked like lightning, but that was not the case. It flashed on very quickly, but it only lit up one cloud instead of the entire cloud bank. It also grew ateady in intensity and then faded slow to nothing. The lengthof time and the fact that the light did not flicker or fluctuate in intensity ruled out lightning in my mind. I have NEVER seen lightning do this in my life. I did not see an object associated with this, but I have not idea what could have caused this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It came down the sky extremely fast, then suddenly went accross the sky slowly. Me and my brother started to follow it in his car, and i kept watch on it until we went behind a 3 or 4 houses, and at the other side it had dissapeared. Elton is in the countryside so it&#39;s all open space so there is no where it could have been hidden. This is our first sighting. We went home and seperately drew what we saw, when we showed each other, they were the same apart from my brother didnt notice the small lights in the middle because he was driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sun was about 5 to 10 degrees obove the horizon, as viewed from Aurora in late afternoon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very bright rainbow type light illuminated a short &#34;hanging curtain&#34; cloud to the left of the soon to be setting sun. The light was a brilliant aqua green that shifted to yellow then a pale orange as if you were looking at a short section of a rainbow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure this was a form of sundog, however I noted that the flat luminous cloud reflecting the sun, sort of like a shimmering curtain of a cloud  was totally unlike the other clouds in the sky, which were mostly small round puffs covering most, but not all of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was only after I had watched the sundog, and it was starting to weaken, that I noted the short curtain cloud causing this effect was directly under what I would call a dark, cigarette shaped cloud from which the curtain cloud descended.  I would not call the dark cloud a cigar shape, but more of a thin, long cigarette.  There were no similar cloud formations in the sky. But there were other apparently higher clouds farther west and thus that might account for the cigarette cloud being darker, as it was in the shadow of other clouds between it and the sun. But again, the sun dog seemed limited to just his halo or hanging curtain of mousture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It might have been verdigri extending down from this long, thin cloud, but normally that is in very long strings whereas this was shorter and more compact.  But the cloud causing the sundog was like a mist cloud, perhaps an effect of the angle of the sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am fairly certain this was a form of sundog, with the cloud particles in just the right spot to bend and refract the sunlight in my direction. (I was in the south parking lot of Aurora Mall on Alameda Avenue.)  I am not posting this as a ufo or unidentified object, but wish to post it in reference to the contrasting long thin cloud above the sundog in case anyone else had a differing view of this event that would indicate something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The four of us, three males and one female aged in our early twenties, finally arrive and decide to celebrate down at the beach on the sand..... At about 4:30am a mate starts yelling about a UFO he is seeing that is flashing a light in the night sky....that he has been watching for a minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we all saw it....It was right near us out to sea, there were some clouds that probably shaded our view for where it started. It first was a bright white light that was maybe 3-4 kms altitude. It was moving east towards Melbourne. Then changes direction slightly and the white light dims till it is almost out, while moving in a NE to E to NE continually. Now it is quite dim and you could almost not see it. Then the light dims on again but it is red and it is shining. But it wasnt as strong as the white light, but it was further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I could speculate as to the shape, it was probably disc or a ball, and probably the size of a small plane..... One thing I dont have to speculate on now is the existance of EBE&#39;s as I can safely say, that was no man made craft....<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No sound was reported.  It was in the shape of an aircraft somewhat, sort of the shape of the video game Starfox.  It was reported by my post and another post on Camp Taqqadum in Al Habbiniyah, Iraq.  It must have been between the two posts and probably about 1000m - 2500m away from my position.  The craft had a bright blue glow around it (somewhat like a comet), and had a trail of smoke and particles.  Again, I must infer that there was NO sound, and the location between two posts would make it impossible that it was a missle or aircraft that is known to myself because no sound was reported, and I was outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Over the rest of the day i have had multiple unexplained bizzare sightings and apparitions. 7:00am, wake-up for morning shower before work, it is still very dark and i spot a small figure move across my back porch (it is an outdoor porch), it was approx. 3 feet in size. I was so frightened by the figure i locked myself in my basement room. No windows or ways to peek in. Around 7:30am, i hear unexplained noises,  anywhere from a bang to a boom to a loud ring in only 1 ear. 2:00pm, i wasnt so phased by the figure anymore, but i decided to drive to a friend&#39;s house on the outskirts of the city. As i am driving, i see a large diamond shaped light come from a patch of woods off New Trebien Road, the light proceeded to fade and  i could spot movement towards the car, it had a dark dark graphite type of texture and color, the object moved away from the car and disappeared into the woods. 2:30pm, i arrive at my friends and we talk about the strange appearances. By the time i leave around, 4:00am the next morning, me and my friend arrive at my home at 4:30 or 40. BAM, that little figure appears at 7:00am right on the dot. My T.V. goes haywire, the only thing that happens from then on is us getting in my car, driving 2 miles out of town, stopping, puking and proceeding to the nearest church i can find. I speak to the pastor at the church at 8:00am and he tells me bad things are to do with that house, but this did not have me and my friend convinced. So here i am at 12:00 noon, writing this looking for some sort of explaination on the weird and frightening appearances. Is this only the beginning of these odd appearances? I pray i never see a little 3 foot pygmy on my back porch ever again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We were about little past midway across the bridge when my wife, who is very skeptical about UFO&#39;s in general commented, &#34;What is That up there?&#34;   What she noticed was a strange twinkling light (changed from reddish to yellow and white very quickly) over what appeared to be South Tampa. The object was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon and was slightly descending in a tight corkscrew pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the light was emitting glowing red balls that were larger than the object and with a much brighter luminosity. These lights seemed to descend to different altitudes before disappearing.  When I saw this I thought that they may have been doing exercises off of the back end of MacDill Airforce base and that the balls might have been flares but these balls did not remain luminous for a long period (a few seconds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the object made the most stunning emission of what looked like a flood of sparks. It took on the appearance of the classic comet type of configuration and moved in lazy circles speeding up and slowing down; becoming more luminous and less luminous. I was hypnotized by the object. It was very beautiful. I asked my wife, who was driving, how would you describe that and she commented, &#34;It looked like fireworks&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to notice the turns this object was making and the sudden turns and decreases in speed were amazing. The object continued to emit this flood of sparks and move in a lazy corkscrew while speeding up and slowing down.  During this observation we noticed that a bright light of white yellow color split from the head of the object and rejoined a few seconds later. The observed event lasted approx 10- 15 minutes when we exited on Westshore Blvd.  The buildings obscured the view of the sky.  It may be of important note that the annual Gasparilla Parade was taking place in Tampa this evening, though I am not sure the times.  I am very interested to know if anyone else submitted a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background-I am a 41 year old Graduate Student in History and my wife is 32 and a Graduate student in Library Science.

We wonder whether it might have been caused by an aerobatic display, performed by an aircraft with pyrotechnic devices on its wings, but that is just a guess, one of many possibilities.  PD))<n>

But now it&#39;s all better and so I&#39;ve been taking some time and catching up on all the latest ufo buzz.  Even though I wasn&#39;t keeping up with the postings on the National UFO Reporting Center, I still continue to observe the sky every night.  I&#39;ve been out every night since Nov. 3, 2003.  Anyways, it&#39;s been very interesting to read everyones different experiences (I decided to only read reports from California for the time being) and  hear their discriptions of the wonderful and unique objects that are always in the skies above us.  I have to say that many of you are writing reports and describing some of the EXACT same kinds of things that I have seen!!! For instance, one couple have seen in the Eastern sky,(5 or 6 times they said) a bright white object that is emitting other white objects from it that fly away on their own.  I too have seen the same thing about 3 times over the past 2 1/2 years.  Quite a few people have seen &#34;lime green&#34; objects in the sky that also light up the sky all around with a flourscent green hue.  I have seen this many times and have observed many green objects that somehow form a green vapour cloud around themselves that comes and then disepates every few seconds.  Sometimes it appears that the object does this to camifloge itself.  I&#39;ve seen purple vapor clouds around a purplish object also. It is such a rush each and every time I&#39;am lucky enough to see these strange wonders.  I think I was one of the first people to report seeing what appeared to be &#34;stars&#34; that suddenly became &#34;moving stars&#34; that moved about in a certain area of the sky as if they had a certain raidius around them to guard or protect.  Well, I just wanted to say that I&#39;am so happy that there are others of you who can truely relate to me and I to you, and I feel very fortunate to be a small part of the BIG picture.  I don&#39;t know exactly what the BIG picture is yet, but have a feeling we&#39;re all going to find out in not the too distant future. I do hope that you all treat our beautiful earth, skies, and those who live there with love, kindness and respect because that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about. I&#39;ll be back!!<n>

I was on my cellphone talking to a friend who only lives five miles north of me. I told him and he ran outside his house and started looking up in the sky towards the north. What we both saw then is so far unexplainable. We both watched as the two objects would jump,bounce,and dart back and forth from each other. Then as suddenly as they apeared they were gone seconds later they reapeared movieng very quickly towards the north west. We also saw more lights appear and disapear in the same manner all together we saw as many as eight in a perfect row at one time. Now I have seen plenty of airplanes at night and I know these were no planes or for that matter weather ballons. So what were they?<n>

They were dull in colour and not recognisable to me as any known stars. After a few seconds, no more than 10, they rotated in formation and their luminosity grew to a bright blue glow and then proceeded to move east across the sky. They proceeded slow at first before surging to a great speed, so great that after a total of no more than 20 seconds they dissapeared off beyond the visable horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other &#39;normal&#39; aircraft in the vicinity, yet this &#39;object&#39; was far higher in altitude and the manouvering of it was like no other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before in my life both personally, and professionally as an aerospace engineer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One at the top of the delta and the other two to the lower left and right but very closely positioned. The colors appeared to be very bright white, green, and red,flashing in a rotating pattern around each object. This observation occured at first slowly and then with a rapid move the objects separated into a line of three, with the center object slighty higher up from the other two. The objects spaced themselves across the horizon equal distant from each other with the exception of the center object which remained higher up on the horizon. This all occured in the Eastern sky. The most predominate celestial object at the time was the constallation Orion to the upper right of all the objects. Once the ojects placed themselves you could observe the blinking light pattern. The only change observed from this point was the light pattern, it went from a delta pattern to a vertical pattern. The objects as observed seemed to get more distant in the sky as time move on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He ran inside to tell me, and we both watched as the lights (blue,bright white, red) began to move and go slowly north then a sharp right and move toward Austin (north east). From the back and side the craft looked like a triange. The next morning I told a freind , who had been in Austin the night before at a party, she said several people at the party had seen the fly over as well.  I then read the report and saw the drawing from the December 12, 2005 Austin event and they seemed to be describing what we had seen.  The sound became quite loud as it flew over and it sounded sort of like a jet, but not exactly and I could see a light from another aircraft to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE sky directly above us was clear but there was a erie pinkish haze in the direction of Austin and San Antonio.  The color of the haze was distacting to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was already dark, a clear night. I was driving alongside the Harbor Freeway (110) and this structure, fairly reminiscent of stadium lights, sat above it. I pulled into the large Alpine Village parking lot to observe. It was square and thin, and I always thought it matched a CD jewel case in dimension ratio-wise. It appeared black in the night sky, with circular white lights that ran in rows throughout the bottom, with one pulsing red light in the center. It was low, about 250-300 feet above the freeway, and would probably be covered by 3/4 of my hand extended as I watched from about 150 yards away. It was about 25 feet on each side. I could hear no sound. And traffic flew by on the freeway below, as this thing didn&#39;t really appear all that unusual. But I wondered what purpose a light grid served that high over the freeway. It was completely still, no wobble or sway, as if it were attached to a pole. After a minute of suspension, it cruised south in a straight line over the freeway , about 30 mph and stopped.  A moment later it traveled north again about 1/3 of the way back. Stopped briefly again, then headed east towards the city of Carson, slowly, and dipped it&#39;s left side and straightened out again. I decided to give chase, but my car was in poor condition and soon lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a plane overhead to my left then three other objects which I thought were initialy planes tracked along the same flight path but seemingly higher. after only a few seconds it was obvious that the three new object were far faster than the aircraft and they were not flashing, at this point one of the light changed direction very dramatically 60-70 degrees and disapeared towards the horizon the other two swept around on a much more circular path and followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thirty seconds later the fouth craft came overhead and from behind me on a direct &#34;chasing&#34; path towards the first three, the speed was simmmilar to that you would see on a shooting star excepting it did not burn out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Near a local saloon between Rockford and Byron.  Object was seen by three observers, who were traveling south on Rt. 2 towards Byron.  Object was also seen near historical landmark and rest area/ boat launch.  Similar sightings near this area have also been spotted say sources. Similar in shape to a modified B-2A ATB bomber aircraft, used by American Military. The craft was suspended about 25 to 30 feet above the River. Two conical white lights opposed to each other about 45 degrees of an angle based on the crafts horizon near what may be the front of ufo .  One pointed at the Rock River, the other pointed to the sky.  There were around three red lights visible, with a possibility of five to six completely around the craft from the &#34;front&#34; to the &#34;rear&#34; of craft.  The craft was a dark ashen gray or black.  After craft was spotted it fled the area at supersonic speeds.  Unfortunately no camera or recording device was present at sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I witnessed this aproximately the same time in the morning last time. Both times I woke my husband because I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes.  They orginally looked like stars.  I thought because it was windy that the trees were making these 5 stars move.  However I went upstairs and these stars were in view way above the tree line.  These stars? Moved!?!  They moved up down and side to side ever so slightly.  The closer I looked at one and stared I could see below the light a blinking red light. One of them looked like it was a plane on its&#39;typical flight path to the ocean, but then it stopped.  I even witnessed another red blinking light flying to each of these 5 moving stars. I thought that it was perhaps an airplane from quonset checking these out for the government, but then it went away.  It was a sighting that was in great length and wasn&#39;t brief.  My husband tha I awoke said it was a star, but then I made him stare and watch, and then he was freaked.  We see many airplanes and stars on our 5+ acres, but this definitely wasn&#39;t either.  It was quite frightening.  He didn&#39;t want me to watch anymore because we didn&#39;t want to invite any danger.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Unusual White Lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incident Report:  Unexplained Lights<n> <n><n> Location of Incident:  Southwest of Sherman County Roads 55 and 16<n> <n><n> Date of Incident:  January 18, 2006 Witness:<n> <n><n> Patrol Deputy; Sherman County Sheriff’s Office<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1943 hours on the above date, I was on routine patrol in the area of (southwestern) Sherman County Road 55, westbound, and approaching the intersection of County Road 16.  There are no street lights or other light sources in that area, as it is quite remote, with only a very few residents living in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I proceeded west on Road 55, my attention was drawn to my left, to approximately a ten to eleven o’clock position, by unusual lights, which appeared almost instantaneously, which I caught out of the corner of my eye.  The lights appeared to be five orange fire-like balls, which appeared to be on the same horizontal plane.  As I perceived movement out of the corner of my eye, but the lights were not moving when I looked at them directly, my impression was that the lights had traveled in a left to right, or east to west fashion.  The lights hung in the sky, approximately 10 degrees off of the horizon, clearly stationary, for approximately five seconds, before each of them blacked out simultaneously.  I immediately pulled my patrol car over to the side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within approximately twenty seconds, I observed one light, starting just above the level of the first row of lights, illuminate, followed by a series of four additional lights that illuminated over the course of perhaps two seconds, and in equal intervals.  I estimate these lights to have been approximately 15 to 20 degrees off of the horizon.  I could observe no smoke trail, as one would expect with high intensity military type flares, and noted the lights were equally spaced, which would be quite difficult to do with precision, with ground launched military flares.  These lights remained illuminated for perhaps five seconds, and again, as with the previous lights, shut off in unison.  This synchronicity in the illumination patterns seemed, to my thinking, to eliminate flares as the source, as flares would burn out at different times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited in that location for several minutes, but observed no additional lights in the area.  Additionally, I was monitoring the Renner Field CTAF/Unicom Frequency, as well as the Aircraft Emergency frequency, and overheard no unusual traffic on those channels.  My impression was that the lights were quite far away, possibly in the area of Cheyenne Wells, Colorado, but could not make any determination as to distance whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing this anomaly twice, I telephoned Goodland Police Officer [WITHHELD], whom I knew to have an interest in such oddities.  Officer [WITHHELD], who was off duty, listened incredulously to the observations I had just made, and stated that he would be en route to my location from his residence in Goodland.  That call was placed to Officer [WITHHELD] at 1946 hours, and lasted between one and two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I awaited the arrival of Officer [WITHHELD], at 1955 hours I telephoned the National Weather Service Field Office in Goodland, and spoke to the meteorologist on duty.  I did not catch his name, but I explained to the meteorologist who I was, and that I had just observed some very unusual lights, which I estimated to be south of the Town of Kanorado, but that I could not estimate a range at which I observed the anomalies.  I asked if the weather radar had picked up any unusual activity in the area from Kanorado south in the vicinity of the state line, and probably into Colorado.  The NWS employee checked the previous twenty minutes of radar data, and stated only that &#34;There is one anomalous return south of Kanorado on one pass, but that’s not unusual.&#34;  I asked if the NWS radar was calibrated to pick up aircraft, or if it eliminated aircraft from the data collected, and he said that routine air traffic was not detected by the radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1958 hours, I received a call from Officer [WITHHELD], asking to confirm my location, and I then moved to the intersection of County Roads 17 and 55 to make his finding me somewhat easier.  From that location, I could still observe the area of the sky in which I had observed the unusual lights.  Officer [WITHHELD], arrived at my location at 2003 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the arrival of Officer [WITHHELD], we observed what we regarded as unusual lights, although they were quite small.  The lights appeared to be consistent with those of small aircraft as far as size, but the FAA required colors and flashing lights were not present.  These unusual lights consisted of steady-on white lights, and we noted an unusual lack of known air traffic in the area.  These lights seemed to begin directly south of our location, and continued to the area directly above us, and west for some distance.  As it was a clear night, numerous light and commercial aircraft could be observed in the area, but none were in the vicinity of the white lights we were observing.  I began checking all aircraft frequencies at that time, and found nothing unusual in any aircraft radio traffic.  However, it was clear that none of the &#34;known&#34; aircraft were in the area of the unusual white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These white lights appeared to be moving, largely in a southwesterly direction, but I did observe a small group of three, just above the horizon, which appeared to be spinning in a counterclockwise circle, as if it were three separate aircraft circling at an air show.  However, these three lights did not contain any of the FAA mandated lighting, and the pattern flown was quite tight, leading me to believe that not even the best of pilots would attempt such maneuvers, particularly at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 2025 hours, the sequential orange lights again appeared in the same vicinity as I had initially observed them, following the same pattern of lighting up sequentially, creating the illusion of movement, remaining illuminated for a few seconds, and blacking out in unison.  This occurred twice, and Officer [WITHELD] was able to see for himself, the lights which I had described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this sighting, we remained in the area perhaps another twenty minutes, but nothing occurred, so we left the area altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Deputy [WITHHELD] Sherman County Sheriff’s Office<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of this excellent report.

Suddenly an oval shadow caught my eye moving from right(NE) to left (SE). It was about 50 feet wide and 30 feet high.  The shadow flashed across the road in front of me then was clear as day on the brick sidewall of the overpass as it moved away at a speed of over 100 MPH.  I immediately assumed it was an airliner as Baltimore Washington International Airport is about fifteen miles away so I looked up in the air and their was nothing.  Since it was a warm day I had my window down.  There was absolutely no sound.  I thought that perhaps it had been a State Police Helicopter.  There was nothing and their Dauphin Helicopters have a distinctive sound. There was not a cloud in the sky.  There was nothing that could have made that distinctive oval shadow moving at a high rate of speed without one sound.  I am a US Air Force veteran and aviation nut so I pay close attention to anything that flies.  I have no explanation for this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No way I could have caught up with it because it was moving so fast; in under a minute it was out of site. This thing in the sky looked like the roof of the old Seattle King dome just sitting in the clouds, I saw it when it moved faster than the rest of the skyline, then it just sped away.

1/18/06 03:00|Natchitoches|LA|Light|40 minutes|My friends and I witnessed 4 objects of orange light moving across the sky in formation for about 40 minutes. ((Advertising lights??))|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50173.html|101|ndxe200601| My friends and I witnessed 4 objects of orange light moving across the sky in formation for about 40 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing in my yard smoking a cigarette with my friends when I happened to look up at the sky and notice a ball of an orangish light fly across the sky between two trees in my yard. The night sky was completely clear and no clouds were in the air so I could see the object of light quite clearly. The light moved too fast to be an airplane, produced no sound, was at a hight of about 200 feet or 300 feet, and seemed to have a small haze around it. At first it was on a southwest trajectory, but then changed immediately to a west north west trajectory. At first I thought I just was seeing things or got too much of a buzz off my cigarette. However, after talking with my friends for another 5 minutes I decided to look in the sky where I saw the object. After watching for about 45 seconds I witnessed 3 more lights move across the same area of the sky in a southeast trajectory in formation. Startled I let two of my friends know what I had seen. We decided to go to the backyard where there was less light and trees to see if we could all see the objects I witnessed. After being outside for about 2 minutes laying down on a blanket we witnessed four objects move from the west part of the sky to the eastern part only to disappear over the city of Natchitoches, Louisiana. All four lights were moving in formation in the same direction. For about another 30 minutes we watched the sky and only noticed the four objects of light once more above the city of Natchitoches before a thick layer of clouds began to move in. We do not know if it was only four objects that we witnessed in the sky or if it was a total of eleven objects of light that we witnessed in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the possibility that the witness may have been observing advertising lights would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that he was looking at genuine UFO&#39;s.

As I looked skyward, I noticed a silent small sphere moving in a Westerly direction at a good rate of speed. I observed the object for what seemed like 10 or 15 seconds and lost sight of it after it flew over my neighbor&#39;s roof and beyond. It did not appear to change altitude. The object was dark but I could not make out the color. There were no lights on the object. The sky was overcast, so this object was moving under the backlit cloud cover. My first thought was that it was a small latex balloon that got loose. I was smoking a cigarette, and it occured to me that the wind was blowing in the opposite direction. I went back inside and checked the local news website and confirmed that the wind is blowing to the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was hovering at a stand still over Highway 50 just above the tree line of some large native pine trees and looked to be 2 yards length from the ground.  I could&#39;nt believe my eyes as we drove by it and noticed no blinking lights that would portray a personal/commercial aircraft.  If I were to guess, it looked to be a one of ours due to the engineering aspest of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve spotted E.T UFO&#39;s in the past but, this one was somewhat rustic in nature. I say this because there was no discoloration from the lights at the bottom of the triangle it just shined a yellowish/white light.  I should of pulled over to get a closer look however, circumstances and traffic didn&#39;t allow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also forgot to mention that after sighting the object some of the street lights blacked out as it appeared there was a energy force within the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking at planes in the sky when i noticed that there was a huge black missle looking object in the sky. I could not see any wings. From where i was standing it seemed to be smooth like a missile.It had a smoke trail behind it like an ordinary jet but slightly bigger. When i compared it to other planes flying at the same altitude, i decided that it had to be at leat 40 times bigger looking than the jets. It was moving southwest at a fairly high rate of speed. I lost sight of the object when it flew out of seeing range.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just a hard working countryman.  But my sister made me do it (write this).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a second time this object has been seen.  I would describe it as a 2 x 4 (board) shape about 3-4 feet tall and yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming home late (on the first siting) one night, pulling into the drive way, I see this thing in my back yard.  I just drove into the yard (I live in the country on large acreage).  It darted back and forth, with no legs or arms just floating off the ground. I couldn&#39;t keep up with it in my pick up, it was to fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my sister hoping she wouldn&#39;t think I was crazy but, I just needed to tell someone.  All I know is I was a pretty freaked out man.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then having almost forgotten about it 4 months later...my fiance calls me and tells me of what she encountered on her way to work yesterday.  Seeing something a ways down the road in front of her was this same type of thing.   As she was crying telling me about it, that it was yellow and in the shape of a 2x4 board about the height of her small SUV.  She thought she was going to hit it as it floated (kinda hovered) into the middle of the road.  She said it like vaporized as her car passed threw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiance is an ((deleted--professional)) and to her everything is either black or white (there is no gray area)   Please tell me someone else has really seen this type of thing!<n>

It was a ice cold, clear night. My window is one the left side of my bed. I looked out the window real quick and got ready to shut my eyes when I opened them again I saw a greenish object shoot thru the air it was a perfect circle. It almost had a greensih tail too it, it could have been a comet or something, but the real unusal thing is that it when up than down towards the woods in a split second. After that I got up looked around alot longer, nothing was seen again accept I saw eight to nine planes flying thru the air after that happened. It is not the first time I have seen unusal activity during the cold winter months. I am going to try to get my video camera to see if it happens again. Also these last 2 days my truck will not start. And the baby moniter, and alarm clock make high pitched buzzings noises in the middle of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had no flashing lights like an helicopter or a plane. i am putting this on the sight because i would like some explination on what was it i saw until today i am still in aww at what i saw and cannot keep my eyes out of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/16/06 21:06|Glasgow (UK/Scotland)||Light|approx 3 minutes|glowing object of great speed with alternating directional movements in the night sky|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51678.html|111|ndxe200601| glowing object of great speed with alternating directional movements in the night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> whilst waiting on a bus and having a smoke, i looked up or rather across to the sky maybe about a thirty degree angle upwards to see an unusually bright (what i thought was a) star. i then thought to myself the object was gaining height in the sky thinking it was just my imagination or perhaps due to unseen cloud movements i lined the object up with a tree in the distance only to notice it was slightly higher after a few seconds maybe 10 - 20 seconds. on following the object in the night sky it then gave off a kind of dull flash and disapeared, although i thought it had completely disapeared approx. 20 seconds later it reappeared quite a bit higher in the sky and seemed to be glowing a kind of green/purple alternate. the object continued to gain height in the sky before stopping dead for a few seconds and then moving slightly to the left. the object then stopped again before shooting off at a tremendous speed to the right on an upward course before disapearing after a few seconds. i thought long and hard as to what this object could have been my first thought being some kind of military aircraft, but the objects movements convinced me against this theory and to this day i am completely undecided as to what it could have been. and the other thing i forgot to mention there were two aircraft in the sky around the same time one going left in my field of vision the other going right. seeing the speed of these crafts in the sky furthered my belief the thing i saw was no plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/16/06 21:00|Freeport|ME|Light|Approx 1 hr 45 min|Three lights form a triangle over Maine|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48736.html|112|ndxe200601| Three lights form a triangle over Maine<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out to have a smoke at approx. 9 PM. I noticed an orangish light moving in the direction of east relative to the moon. Thinking it was a plane but watching anyway I noticed it seemed to change direction and move back west. Still thinking it may be a plane I wondered why it would circle at that altitude and in that location, as the nearest airport is in Portland and the light appeared to be quite some distance away from Portland. I continued to observe and the object began to move in highly erratic ways, not typical of aircraft and at too high an altitude for a chopper. It would move in one direction then abruptly the opposite direction. It made short &#34;arching&#34; motions, &#34;swung&#34; back and forth, and sometimes made very short zigzagging motions. I was sitting on my porch which lies on the left side of my driveway if you&#39;re facing away from my house. The driveway is flanked on either side by trees. The starting point of my orginal sighting was behind the trees on the left side. At times the bare branches partially obscured my vision of it. It continued to &#34;swing&#34; back and forth in a slow, almost drunken-looking manner and at times appeared to travel in half circles (although because of my perspective they could have been full  circles). At times it would appear to move toward me, appearing to rise in altitude, then it would reverse direction with no apparent turning radius and move away from me. About ten minutes into the sighting I called to ((name deleted)), a housemate and the only other occupant at home at the time, to come take a look, asking him if he saw what I saw or if I was imagining things. After observing for a couple minutes he confirmed the object did appear to be moving. I was able to call out the directions I thought it was moving in (right, now left, right again, up, left now) and he confirmed that he was seeing the same movements. The object continued to move in a general direction of east in relation to the moon until it was fully clear of the trees and instead of being on the far left of the driveway it was on the right. Most notable about the movements were that although it was hardly ever still, they seemed to have a &#34;directionless&#34; quality to them. At times it would zigzag in quick motions, sometimes appear to &#34;swing&#34; or &#34;sway&#34;, and it reversed directions seemingly at random.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed outside as long as I could. My housemate and I had moved from the porch to the driveway to get a better look, and stayed in the driveway for what might have been 15 minutes. Then we returned to the porch and David went back inside. I was absolutely frozen at this point, the temperature was about 20 degrees. I wanted to go back inside but was afraid to miss something. Back at my original position, the position I was in when the sighting began, it was notable that not only was the object not obscured by trees anymore, it had crossed the imaginary median of the driveway and was at a higher point than when it started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally I absolutely could not stay outside any longer. I rushed inside and turned off the lights, hoping it would be visible from the two large windows at the front of the house. I felt pretty stupid for having sat outside for so long when I discovered it was indeed clearly visible from inside the windows. I made ((name deleted)) turn off the TV so there was no reflection on the glass to obscure vision and we watched it continue to behave in much the same erratic and meandering manner. About five minutes into observing it from inside I noticed another light, this one brighter and whitish, in relatively the same spot the first had started in. It was acting much the same way, possessing the same &#34;zigzagging&#34;, &#34;swinging&#34;, half circle-making traits. The first orangish light sort of seemed to calm down with the appearance of the second light, still moving but not as obviously. It seemed to settle in a basic area, northeast of the moon. At this point my mother came home and we all observed the movement. About 4 minutes after that a very bright whitish-blue &#34;star&#34; that had been there the whole time began to show signs of movement. We all watched as the lights eventually settled into basic areas, still moving but not meandering around anymore. They held their basic postions (the first, orangish light appearing not to move at all anymore, the second only making occasional tiny movements and the third primarily seeming to &#34;ascend&#34; and &#34;descend&#34;, but also making the characteristic half-circles and zigzags) and their positions formed an isoceles triangle tipped on its side with the &#34;point&#34;, the brightest and most recent light, pointing southeast. The first, orangish light was holding position on the northernmost tip and the second whitish one was southwest of the orange one. At one time a plane bisected the triangle horizontally and the objects did not appear to respond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A while later I stopped observing them. I was tired and my neck hurt from looking up. I know they were present at a little past ten still. I don&#39;t know when they disappeared but by 10:30 they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing to note...it was dark and cloudless but when the objects moved, especially when they moved dramtically, a cloudy or smoky haze could be seen in front of them and the light would be a little obscured. It seemed like the smoke mimicked the movements made by the light, i.e. if they moved in an upwards backward-facing &#34;C&#34; motion, the &#34;smoke&#34; would also form a backward-facing &#34;C&#34;.<n>

It was very cold, and usually I walk to my job listening to my Ipod blasting, so I cant hear anything. Bishop Grandin was deserted, it looked as if I was the only person in the Boulevard. As I approached the intersection at Lakewood and Bishop Grandin, I could see an odd shaped craft appear, hovering over the intersection. It seemed to be about 200 meters in diameter. Once I took my headphones out, I could hear an odd humming noise emanating from the object. It had orange and yellow lights in a pattern and appeared to be spinning quite fast. There was also an orangie-redish haze above and below the craft. The craft levitated for about 2 min., moving up, down, left and right. After it executed this manure, my Ipod shut off. This was strange because I had charged it fully before I left my house. The object hovered for another minuet and rose into the sky. It shot away at what seemed to be &#34;light-speed&#34; in a north-north-west direction. It was snowing when I had this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I WAS TRAVELING 65 MPH AND IT REMAINED IN ONE PLACE DURING THIS TIME.  I HAD READ THAT THERE IS TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION POSSIBLE, SO I SENT A MENTAL GREETING AND ASKED TO BE SHOWN A SIGN IF THEY WERE WHAT I THOUGHT THEY WERE.  INSTANTLY THE LIGHT WINKED OUT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY THAT NIGHT AND NO OBJECTS IT COULD HAVE DISAPPEARED BEHIND.  ALMOST INSTANTLY IT APPEARD AGAIN, FAR TO THE RIGHT OF WHERE IT HAD JUST BEEN, OVER THE TOWN OF JEROME.  I EXPERIENCED A DEFINITE FEELING OF CONTACT WITH SOME KIND OF INTELLIGENCE.  WISHED THEM WELL AND CONTINUED ON MY WAY.  BY THIS TIME I WAS APPROACHING COTTONWOOD AND HAD TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE TRAFFIC.

It was a high sky, cloudless day.  After approx an hour or so in the air from Tampa airport (must&#39;ve been above the Carolina&#39;s),<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced out of my window and saw an object within about a half mile from the plane and behind the plane.  It was white and shaped like an &#34;L&#34; of like a hockey stick.  I thought perhaps it was a cloud so I consiously looked to see if it had a less defined or changin shape but, it did not, it was solid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as I watched it, I thought perhaps I was looking at a partial outline of the tail of another plane so, I concentrated and looked around the object but, there was nothing around it.  Not even a trail of smoke or anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought about tapping the guy next to me but, was afraid I&#39;d lose sight of it so, I continued to watch it as it now slowly moved directly in line with my window seat and then after about 30 seconds, it moved ahead of the plane but, still equi-distant away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then turned away from the plane and shot away at a very high rate of speed.... and it was gone.  And this is the truth.<n>

She&#39;s pretty clueless as when it comes to technology.  This is the view from her street, in front of her building.  A big storm had just passed and she thought the sky looked really pretty so she took a picture.  The object is clearly visible.  It kind of looks like a donut or possibly a life preserver.  Its definately not a plane or a bird and it doesnt look like any cloud ive ever seen.  She did not notice it until she looked at the picture later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

No sounds no lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were sitting in hot tub on deck watching the northern and north eastern sky for shooting stars.  It was a clear night sky no clouds perfect for seeing shooting stars.  The house was east of us so the northern horizion was blocked by the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were watching over the roof of the house into the sky a black triangle with no lights and no sound went over the house.  The stars started disappearing as the craft blocked them from our view.  The stars reappeared as it passed.  When it was directly over head you could make out the variation between the night sky and the black color of the craft.  There were very close in color but you could make out the distinct sharp edges of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bottom was flat as flat can be.  The edges of the craft were sharp like a blade not rounded.  There was no visable rounding of any part of the craft.  The craft was a triangle its sides appeared to be equal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very very slowly I would guess it to be 100 yards across the leading edge and so for the other two edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess it to have been moving at around 20 to 30 miles an hour.<n>

It was about 75 yards away from me and I would say it was about 50-75 yards above the ground.  I passed by some woods and the thing seemed to travel right over the tree tops and it traveled just as freely as I passed some fields.  It appeared to be lighted from within.  There were no visible external lights and it was slightly larger than a basketball in size when held at an arm&#39;s length.  I&#39;ve seen these spheres before, first time being in 1991 on my way home from work in the middle of the night.  Subsequent sightings took place while I lived in Florida and now I&#39;ve relocated back to upstate NY (my latest sighting).  After a few minutes, this sphere came close to my car as I drove and it kept pace with me.  It was as strange a sight just as the previous times. I&#39;ve made a few reports to this site before and I know that there really is something out there.  Although this may seem impertinent, but what I thought should only take me a few minutes to get home, I was shocked to realize that I&#39;d lost 1 hour and a half by the time I arrived.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then as there was very little wind I realised the object was moving west above the clouds and about the size of the moon but not the moon the was located elsewhere. It was a similar colour to the moon circular and as bright. Then it changed direction heading south decreasing in size as it went quite quickly.  There were no other lights of any colour. It moved faster than a normal plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The craft looked the size of a jet airliner, but was much lower than an airliner. I looked outside because the wind was blowing real hard and I wanted to check to see if any trees had fell near our home. Then I seen it coming over the mountian and I went back inside to get my son up and he went outside on the back deck with me. He saw the object also, and we came back inside to notify you. I have seen other objects in the sky here. But this time, it was really large and bright!!!<n>

1/14/06 19:19|Swansea (UK/Wales)||Sphere|7 minutes|3 lights flashing simultaneously. 2nd one chased the 1st. 3rd one began spinning, emanating pinkish light. All three did this.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48721.html|132|ndxe200601| 3 lights flashing simultaneously. 2nd one chased the 1st. 3rd one began spinning, emanating pinkish light. All three did this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 7.10pm 6 miles from Swansea, I noticed some stars in the sky. As I focused on the highest star, I noticed it was flashing, but the two below it (diagonally) were also flashing simultaneously. I was convinced they must be planes, but continued to watch them. The lowest in the sky continued to move downwards, whereas the second one followed it relatively slowly, before suddenly moving quickly after it. The highest &#39;star&#39; remained in the same place, and, as I watched it, I suddenly felt as though it was watching me. Once I thought this, it began to &#39;spin&#39; and a pinkish light emanated from it. The other two objects lower in the sky became visible again (behind two houses opposite) and all three objects spun and emanated the same light simultaneously. There was no trail (as in a plane), and no noise. Then all three disappeared very quickly. I&#39;m not a UFO enthusiast, and have never witnessed anything like this before. Around 30 mins later, I noticed a plane moving from the direction where the objects had disappeared, with a bright red flashing light, and a number of white lights all around it. This was a plane which went over my house, and left a trail in the sky. It wasn&#39;t a commercial plane. Planes never travel directly over my house either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m pretty skeptical, although try to maintain a sense of critical open-mindedness. I have never seen anything like this before, and felt compelled to share it with others. It really does make you wonder. My profession is psychology - I have a PhD in psychology (one of the most skeptical professions ever), and I&#39;m just finishing a doctorate in clinical psychology. I find it amazing that after feeling that the object was &#39;watching&#39; me, that it began spinning immediately afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

You could see the flames it was red in color. It had to have been huge and it was moving faster than an airplane but it did not shoot across the sky like a shooting star. It was a bit alarming to see a fireball coming across the sky like that. We watched it for about 5 minutes when it disappeared for about 15 seconds and then reappeared again. This is when we noticed two other fireballs. They were going in a triangle shape going east in the sky. Just about 5 miles from the Sallisaw exit the first one disappeared. The fire seemed to disappear from the front and then from the back and then nothing. The second fireball did the same as the first. The third fireball we watched when we pulled off the first Sallisaw exit. We watched until we turned onto the street and the trees got in our way.

Very smooth, with horizontal lines near the center. It was huge and oval in shape. I stopped on the shoulder and observed 3 streaks that looked like smaller portions of the cloud, shooting away from the cloud. 2 of the streaks, joined together, it seems, and returned to the cloud. These 2 made a single formation, with 2 tails. They were not flying very fast. There was no trail, but the small objects looked like they had exhaust. No sound.

But then NOTHING!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just come home from Applebees and it was about 1:30AM.  I was going to the bathroom and decided to open the window because it was unseasonably warm that night (about 50 F).  I was reading a magazine and then all of a sudden I hear this loud swish of air outside.  It sounded like a large aircraft flying over with absolutely no engines on.  Then I heard a second sound immediately after the first one.  I thought to myself that something is going to crash.  I remember the TWA 800 crash and I thought that it was going to happen again in my back yard.  However, I looked outside and saw nothing.  I thought maybe the object was on the other side of my house and I will hear it crashing soon, however, there was no crash.  it just swooped by with no sound whatsoever other then the sound of the rushing air around it.  I quickly finished up and went outside and it was the weirdest thing.  It was so quiet.  I have never heard it so quiet before in my life.  Not a single sound.  Absolutely no wind.  No sounds from cars or anything else, just complete peacefulness and a uncomfortable quietness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what this was that flew by my house that night.  I thought for sure a large plane would come crashing down but nothing ever happened.  It was the strangest thing I have ever experienced.  I still get goosebums thinking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was, perhaps, 4 times the brightness of Venus.  Since planes are often seen in that part of the sky I reckoned it was a plane heading for Green Airport in Warwick, RI.  But as I watched the bright yellowish-white light it faded out to a tiny point of white light and disappeared.  It did not change its position. It faded out into nothing.  There were no landing lights, only this one extremely bright whitish light.  I estimate that it was from 2 to 5 thousand feet in the air.  I see planes regularly coming from the SW toward Warwick but this was not a plane or a star or anything else I can think of.  I watch the skies often for UFOs and am reporting this as it is enough out of the ordinary to warrant it a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched this thing the whole way home.  I am convinced it wasn&#39;t a plane, a cell phone tower, the moon, or anything else.  We got back in the truck at approx. 7:45pm (Mountain Time) to go look for it again and it was gone.  Please contact me back on this.  Thank you!<n>

After watching closely thinking it must be a helicopter to be still for so long it began a turn away from me to my right. Out the sliding door to my left two steps away I went to follow and get a look at the side or another angle. What appeard to be a helicopter now from the side would make sense of the stillness of the light when first noticed but the sound of the engine did not.  It sounded like a jet engine of some sort as it moved out of sight behind a house two doors down.  A slight brightness from the moon to the west showed some haze in the sky which would make darting through the house to the front to follow the lights inefective in my mind, plus the fact of disbelief makes you tend to doubt what you just witnessed.  We have many commercial jets fly overhead in a pettern to land in Philadelphia but this light was of vast difference.  It is expected to be a very clear day today and stars were visible straight overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I just copy and pasted this from bautforum.  They call it cosmoquest b.s now.  I don&#39;t like the name.. I&#39;m chunky :)  from retrospect reading this now I have new in site.  Only with the sound thou.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started playing guitar when I moved back to Arkansas shortly after the sighting.  I can still hear and my mind and feel with my chest the resonance of that sound.  It was damn close to drop D.  In tune, in what ever tune it was. it wasn&#39;t an ugly sound u know.  Just one that made  you know it was there.  Powerful.  It made me palse the TV.  And seriously wonder what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I didn&#39;t mention, but still remember, how it blacked out the stars in the background.  It was black. I couldn&#39;t see a star but the the lights.  Not until it left from me a little ways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.s. I clicked possible abduction bc about a year ago I had a dream. I was in Oklahoma.  On Idaho street where my dad and I lived, where I saw the lights.  It was night time and I could feel that sound, the I was lifted up off the ground suspended for a time. Then snatched backwards at an angle into the sky.  I awoke panicked.  So maybe it was a dream.  Maybe it was a memory lol .  doesn&#39;t really matter.

Due to it&#39;s remote location and the high number of heavy and/or expensive tools on the site I have been camping out on the house site. 11:52 PM on the 11th day of the 1st month of 2006 I went outside to see why my dog was whining and to smoke a cigarette. Then I noticed a bright shimmering light above the next ridge. I found this to be strange because I look at that ridge on a consistent basis and there has never been anything over there. As I watched it the light began growing slightly larger and pulsating, inbetween pulsations a red light would appear. I got another smoke and continued watching, after a couple minutes it started to rise straight upwards. Then it started to come towards me, all I could do was smoke and watch in astonishment as this thing came straight at me. The craft started to gain shape as it got closer, I could tell it was triangular in shape and it had one extremely bright white light on the front and a pulsating red light underneath. It gained speed as it got closer and passed a regular jet in a couple of seconds. As it passed overhead I could tell it was huge, dwarfing any regular jet in the sky. It passed by without making a sound and within a few more seconds it was gone. The hairs on my neck would not go down and I had to have several more smokes before I could calm down and go to bed. Then on this morning of the 12th I got on your website and see a drawn picture of exactly what I saw last night. Trust me when I say my hairs are on end again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking out my bedroom window from upstairs and it appeared to look like a cone shaped with maybe three layers of red lights. It moved straight upwards into the sky. It was not an airplane, airplanes do not fly straight up or have 3 layers of red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She called me out and I saw it too.  We decided to walk down near the Chemung river to get a better view.  We were next to the river at 1:00 AM.  It was a light that would change color from a very bright white light and would change to a red/white and orange/white to blue/white and moved in a counter clockwise circle.  The lights were on for one second and off for one second and would move in the circle at odd intervals.  However, a pattern did seem to exist.  It slowly moved upward.  Since it was getting cold, we decided to walk back home.  By the time we got back home about twenty minutes later, the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I looked out of the window and saw 4 small teardrop shapes high in the sky above me. The four craft moved in towards one another before disappearing. The craft were blue grey and seemed semi-fluorecent there was a greenish haze around them. As they moved more quickly they became yellow green in colour. Afterwards there was a power cut for about 20 - 25 minutes.

The object was making rotational movements and was also having right to left movements. The first of the witnesses (a 8-year old child) asked her brother(10 years) and her cousin (11 years) to look up and watch it. The children got terrified as the object seemed to be fast approaching them and they believed it would strike the earth anytime. The child and the cousin ran inside but the brother thought it was just a flash and he continued playing. However on looking up after a minute or so, he also observed the same thing which was like a saucer with multiple lights flashing from its undersurface. There was a projection from the top surface and he thought a planet is falling down on the earth. It was blue and then changed to red. The lights under the surface were very bright and there was a fast rotational movement of the object going on and it was fast coming down towards him. Scared he also rushed inside and kept crying and holding on to their uncle. The uncle came out to check but couldnt find anything. The children satyed terrified for a long time and were reluctant to come out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/9/06 20:00|Mesa|AZ|Triangle|3 hours|Black Triangle glides over the night sky|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48676.html|161|ndxe200601| Black Triangle glides over the night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few nights ago my girlfriend and I were driving home from a local store when I happened to look out the side window and noticed a large-sized bright yellow Orb moving fast over the distant highways about 4 or 5 miles away. This was about 7:30 PM. The Orb had been following our vehicle in what appeared to be a straight course to the far left of me but also moving towards us.  I had a strange feeling it was watching us and following us back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we turned some corners and finally getting home I didn&#39;t see the light anymore so I thought it was probably just a plane with bright lights, but I decided to go outside and look up at the sky anyway because I had a feeling that it wasn&#39;t a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 8:00 PM I saw that the Orb had reached the starlit sky where I was standing. It must have followed our vehicle all the way back. What happened during the next three hours are things I don&#39;t think can ever be explained. It moved very slow, without any sound at all. Imagine a hang-glider gliding over the sky without a sound, all was quiet. By this time however, the object had drastically dimmed to an eery dark glow and I saw what looked like a perfect black triangle. I could make out the entire outline as if the lights of the moon and stars were reflecting off of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Triangle was very detailed. In fact it looked similar to that recent Triangle UFO posted on this website from Auston, TX. But there were some big differences with the one I saw. There was a red front light on the tip of the Triangle, and two red stationary lights on the two back tips. None of the lights moved or changed. The lights were dim, like those laser-pen lights, and lit up the image of the Triangle. There were no planes around when this was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My backyard was small, and darkened, it was situated in an apartment complex. I stayed there to watch as I didn&#39;t want to go out into the open sidewalk. The movement was very strange, it would drift further away, turn around and then go the other way, as if it was rotating in a long, slow circular pattern. It went on like this for about two hours. Sometimes it would fade off in one direction only to appear at another place in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point the Triangle&#39;s red tip shot out a faded yellow light beam through the sky. The beam had no movement and reached a far distance. Then the beam would vanish. I decided to walk around the apartments a bit and it seemed like the object would turn its course and follow my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last hour, the third hour around 11:00 PM, it was in the middle of the sky and did the strangest thing, it shot out a small white orb from the side. The orb slowly went a ways then changing its course flew back inside the Triangle. I had no idea what it was doing but that is what happened! The orb looked like one of the stars but it had no sparkling effect like a star does. Eventually the Triangle drifted off through the sky I don&#39;t know where it went from there, but I could no longer see it. Whatever that thing was, I know for sure that it was no plane...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The other 3 persons also at that moment seen and observed it. It was about 2000 ft./2500 ft. approx. in altitude and appeared to be 30 feet in width and 90 feet in length. The duration of travel was around 22 seconds and then we lost sight due to tree line and buildings. None of us know what it could have been, and even though it was quite a phenomenal sight, none off us think of it much, consciously or subconsciously.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object remained totally motionless for at least 5 minutes. I then called my house-mate outside and she observed the same &amp; agreed it did not resemble any airplane/craft as we DO normally see in our area, being in-line north of OIA (Orlando International Airport) &amp; also east-northeast of Orlando Executive Airport. There were NO &#39;navigation&#39; - &#39;marker&#39; type lights observed. We together observed the object for a total of approx. 15 minutes when it slowly started drifting northward at an extremely slow pace. This northward drift took on a slight eastward flare and continued until unobservable due to distance after a total observation time of approx. 25 minutes. Sky conditions were clear and other aircraft were observable with readily detectable nav-marker lighting at similar distance/direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

All that is in it is correct, I DONOT believe it all.  But I must be honest and share it. I have detect a ufo in the ground and it has been here a very long time. I have found only (1) thing that is evidence that the ufo was there. Over time what I found was that one ufo was only one of a number of them. because the metal is detect in complete shape I have to say that the metal was a alloy that was like ours  becouse any other metal would be found in pieces not complete like what was found.  I do not know why I found it but I did. becouse it is complete it is like a blueprint and you can tell how it would work . It being the large one is so large you would think that it would hold a lot of there poeple, but when you look at the print , you see that only the core of it would hold life. the outer part it like ballast tank, this allows it to go to the bottom of water. It has in the core (7) riser that lets it rise without vacum damage it. This design shows that they use all of nature to do things. What I see of there design, If they have it they use it. In march 0f 06 I saw one that was flying . It was only a cicle of light very bright&lt; but looking at it this llght must be very cold to be this bright. becuase they donot have anything that donot use , why have the light. We donot think that they need light to see so WHY HAVE IT. I now know more about ufo,s then I need to know. but am having the same problem that most people have that has see them, Is it because we are unwilling to say that they were here and still here, I donot know but I am happly  to know that I have the luck to studies them, there is a lot to know but I understand you are not going to read it all. But I did share with you this fact. That is all I can do for you<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The distance from my deck to approximately where the object was sighted would be about half a mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that approximate distance the shape was about the size of an elongated vitamin held at arms length. I thought it unusual enough to run all out for the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got out on deck there was nothing there.  I began to scan the area where I had first seen the object and then down back and forth on the water in line with the spit itself.  The only thing I picked up was what appeared to be an orange/red ball just floating on or near the spit part that is underwater - just very shallow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was someone lost a buoy but after observing this object for about 10 - 20 seconds, it rose up at a rapid steep angle heading toward Victoria.  I thought then that it might be a balloon with the wind blowing it around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object had been rising for about 5 seconds it looked like it reshaped itself back into the original dark vertical shape and picked up speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it heading away, from the time it rose up off the water as a sphere, transformed into the dark vertical shape, until I could no longer see it was no more than 30 - 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very unusual event to say the least and influenced by no more than two cups of coffee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place about 2 p.m.  There was no sound and I could observe no specific details on either the ball or the dark vertical shape.<n>

I got closer and had to stop at the intersection light, I noticed that this object was no more than a few hundred feet in the air. I found it odd that any aircraft I have noticed in the air before was considerably higher( enless near an airport)and made some type of noise. Neither one was the case. It seemed to remain in one particular area for about 5-10 seconds. The object then took about a 45 degree turn to fly directly above my vehicle and appeared to disappear soon after that. I completely questioned myself about this, it was unbelievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

1/8/06|Panama City Beach|FL|Sphere|2-3 hours|We were Hurricane evacuees,...it was at this point that we knew it was something extraordinary,..|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49122.html|174|ndxe200601| We were Hurricane evacuees,...it was at this point that we knew it was something extraordinary,..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently we were evacuated to PC Beach, Fl.  Upon our stay we witnessed several unidentified crafts hoovering. They were too low to be stars, and too high to be boats. Similar to what I&#39;ve read by others, they were symetric, metallic looking objects with a deep red eminating from the bottom, sometimes a bright green. They were observed for several nights, since our evacuation from Hurricane Katrina till we arrived home after about 5 months in a hotel. It was a nice hotel with an excellent view of the Gulf from the 6th floor, with a balcony. We have video footage of these objects which seemed to stay just out far enough not to be detected by the naked eye very well. Sometimes they would be in a &#34;formation&#34; of some sort, a &#34;W&#34;. At one point as we were all looking  at them from the balcony, one &#34;craft&#34; lit up, lights seemingly going around the vessel. That was the point that we knew it was something extraordinary. It was also where we could make out the metallic, grey look to the surface. Like two upside down plates, the lights emitted from the upper middle section of the phenomenea. A deep red or green light emitted from the mid-bottom. They hoovered mostly, sometimes moving, sometimes slowly from our vantage wiew, but had to be incredibly fast compared to seeing an aircraft passing by. I wondered why the Air Force weren&#39;t noticing this, since Tyndal Air Force base is located nearby. I am an ex- Army officer, graduated from Loyola University if the South with a BA in Political Science and Sociology. I have a Paralegal degree. I play music as a hobby and for fun and my fiance is a music major. I also have a small business in New Orleans, still operating, and do some independant contract work for Tulane University.<n>

I OBSERVED A TRIANGULAR SHAPED OBJECT WITH LIGHTS IN EACH CORNER OF THE TRIANGLE.  IN THE CENTER OF THE OBJECT WAS ANOTHER LIGHT AND FROM THIS MIDDLE, IT APPEARED TO BE DROPPING ANOTHER BALL OF LIGHT.  THIS OBJECT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING VERY LOW AND MADE NO NOISE THAT COULD BE HEARD OVER NORMAL STREET NOISE.  THE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE MINUTES AND THEN VANISHED.  IT APPEARED TO BE GRAYISH IN COLOR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MY HUSBAND IS NOW TYPING HIS OBSERVATION.  I ALSO OBSERVED THE TRIANGULAR OBJECT WHEN MY WIFE PARKED THE VEHICLE.

TO ME THE LIGHTS ON EACH CORNER APPEARED TO BE ARRANGED IN A RECTANGLE FASHION.  THE MIDDLE LIGHT WAS ROUND.  COMBINED THESE LIGHTS WERE BRIGHT WHICH MADE THE EXACT SHAPE AND COLOR DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DISTINGUISH.  I WOULD ESTIMATE THE COLOR TO BE DIRTY GREY TO BLACK.  THE OBJECT APPEARED LOW TO THE GROUND, QUIET - NO EXPECTED AIRCRAFT SOUNDS - AND SOMEWHAT STATIONERY.  TO ME, THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE &#34;BANKING&#34; CAUSING IT TO DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEARED.  I BASE THIS ON THE MOVEMENT OF THE LIGHTS ON THE &#34;SIDES&#34;.  I OBSERVED THE OBJECT FOR ALMOST THREE MINUTES.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object seen by 6 people and captured on video<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were filming from Cley Hill close to Warminster, Wiltshire, UK  when we saw a very bright light.  We at first assumed it was an aircraft.  When we had been on the hill filming the year before we had been buzzed by a military helicopter.  We assumed this was another helicopter/aircraft coming to do the same.  We began to film in the hope of getting a close up of the helicopter as it passed overhead.  But it never arrived - it was moving towards us and then it suddenly just faded away.  We have all this on film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just to give you a little more information. we are making a documentary about events in Warminster in the 1960&#39;s and the claims of UFO sightings there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have spent 7 nights on the hills around Warminster trying to film something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the only time we have seen anything at all around Warminster - however I had a sighting of a similar object in another part of the country in Feb 1977 - two of us saw that one and in 1974 - again in Feb I was with two school friends when two orange lights passed over us at very low altitude - they seemed to have a whitish mist or glow encased them and were almost joined.  When you looked at the edges of the balls of light they were fuzzy - the effect you get when you see a light through light rain. Both these sightings took place between the West Yorkshire towns of Wakefield and  Holmfirth<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am happy to talk to an investigator - but I do not want my name to be released - but any information I have may help you as you try to put this jigsaw together<n>

The other people in the vehicle was looking at it. After we was looking at it for a few seconds trying to figure out what it was, a flash of light came out behind it and then it and then the whole thing dissapeared, no smoke. It wasn&#39;t the time of flash that looked like a fire anyway. Nothing fell down either. We don&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s but this has made us wonder that there was something definitely not right.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a roundish object in the sky as I was entering a grocery store on Black Rock Turnpike. I stopped breifly to look at it longer. It looked as if it was rotating. it was either bright white or of reflective material. I would also estimate it&#39;s size to be about the same as a small plane. OTHER INFO: I&#39;m pretty sure that this was the same object I had seen in this sky before. I was eating at a fast food place on the same street about a block away. I was able to monitor the object with my naked eyes for the duration of it&#39;s visibility. also in that sighting, it traveled slowly, stopped, changed direction then dissapeared. I am unable to tell you what day it was but it may have been early spring 2005 or 2004. I remember it was cold out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About me. I tend to be very observant. I spotted a cockrach at 20 feet while driving through D.C. if that makes sense to you. I always keep an eye open for something out of the ordinary. I am also a skeptic and look for possible explanations. this may have been a silver mylar party balloon and it was twirling up in the sky. but I think it was too big to be that. party ballons are 18&#34; and this was much larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t quite remember if it had a haze around it.

It had appeared approximately 30 feet above us and looked like it was going to crash into one of the houses in that area.  However, there was no sound and, although anticipating some kind of explosion and/or fire, one never appeared.

After 10 minutes a looked back out and i noticed that the &#34;star&#34; was on the other side of my window.  Thats when i noticed that it began to move.  It went up then down the left then it would dissappear and reappear on the other side of the window.  Finally it stopped moving and thats when i noticed that there were 2 lights in the sky now.  Then i noticed orbs circling around the UFO&#39;s.  Lights just kept on circling them, like i would see 10 then they would dissapear, then i&#39;d see 10 more lights.  During the course of the night the UFo&#39;s moved from the left part of my window to the right part, up and down.  I witnessed them for about 2 hours and they never left.  Half the time they would be stopped in the sky and just look like a star.  But when i began to doubt that it was a UFO it would move again and i would clear see orbs circling them.  Also when it would move it would sometimes leave a blurry trail.  Sometimes the orbs coming out of the craft looked like beams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

However, I know it happened in the last 4 hours of the trip because it was just dark. Therefore, I am pretty sure the siting occurred in Mississippi, though it could possibly have been in eastern Louisiana. I was driving along I20 when I looked up and saw a circular disk flying just over the interstate pretty low. It had lights around the bottom of the disk. It was flying the opposite direction that I was driving which is why I only saw it for a moment and at 70 mph I couldn&#39;t turn around. However, the image was pretty clear for that brief moment, definately not just the blur of streetlights after a long road trip as suspected by some people I&#39;ve told.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Large group of them, very high up in the sky, almost directly above.  very slow moving, very distinct.  Grouped very closely together.  I didn&#39;t see the beginning but at the end the lights disappeared gradually over the period of about 1 minute.  I viewed this from the roof of my apartment and I am very familiar with the lay out of the area and the hills - including the radio transmission beacons which were also visable on the hill around 45 degrees below and 10 degrees left of the grouping.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a really bright star or maybe a planet and I commented on how bright it was because barely any other stars were visible. About 15 minutes later another one of these &#39;stars&#39; that looked exactly the same appeared above and to the right of the first object, at about a 45 degree angle from it. Now, we thought it was really weird and after about 5 minutes of both of the objects staying in place the second object started to dim and all of the sudden flew to the left and shortly after the first object did the same. It dimmed and flew to the left. We watched them until they disappeared behind some trees. I know it couldn&#39;t be a helicoptor or plane because the lights stayed motionless for so long and the glowing of them looked like stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As of late I have been watching what I would call flashes in the night sky. The first time I saw this I thought it was strobes from an aircraft. But after several moments I understood that it wasn&#39;t. Approximately ten seconds later there was another flash in the same part of the night sky. The time was approximately 6:45 PM sometime in early January, then again on the 9th of January. The first sighting was between the constellations of Booties and Orion. The second sighting was later somewhere around 7:30 8:00 PM. this time it was below booties by about 5 degrees. I thought that it might be a satellite. They sometimes will light up as the sun shines through a mountain peak in the west, these flashes were extremely bright nor were there any signs of a satellite. Anyone else see this? Got any ideas? Perhaps a meteor skipping off the atmosphere like a stone skipping across the water? Like I said, I have done a lot of night sky viewing and over the years i have learned to explain most of what I see in the night sky. This however has me scratching my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was going toward the mountain and then quickly made a sharp turn upward and all the lights went out completely.  There was no sound with this object.  At first I thought it might be a helicopter, but it was moving too fast and there was no sound.  I live near an air force base and suspected that they were testing some new aircraft.  ???  I couldn&#39;t track the shape after the lights went out.  It is as if it just disappeared.  I called my friend who is a private pilot and asked him to call the Provo airport tower to see if they tracked this flying object.  They did not have knowledge of this unexplained aircraft.  I have never seen anything like this ever before.  The speed and the ability to make a verticle climb so quickley and then the lights cut out at the same time hiding its presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a triange craft very large with double white lights at each corner (on the bottom) of the craft.  I could see the plates on the bottom of the craft.  There was no sound.  I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes.  For some reason I didn&#39;t tell my husband.  I didn&#39;t really believe what I saw.  I gave me the sense of something quite large. I decided that it had to be a stealth bomber but looking at pictures of them, they don&#39;t have the right shape.  I won&#39;t claim it was extraterrestial but I haven&#39;t seen anything like it.

I would estimate the size of each orb to be equivalent to a grain of salt held at arms length.  The weather at the time was overcast with snow showers at the top of English Mountain.  The orbs appear to &#34;dance&#34; up and down and side to side somewhat independantly from one another.  However, they would stay relatively close to one another at all times at a distance that appeared to be about 1-2 inches at arms length.  Each orb would periodically become hidden in the cloud cover and then reappear. One orb eventually disappeared into the clouds followed shortly thereafter by the second one.  Before the second one finally disappeared, it&#39;s color changed from red to white.<n>

I was just taking a walk during my lunch hour, it was past 12:30 and I just happened to look up, and there it was. I t was so high up in the sky, and I could barely discern the shape. With the naked eye, it seemed like the head of a pin was floating in space,it seemd to be either circular or comma shaped, I knew it was really high because two planes just happened to fly almost right next to it, but right away I realized that it was even higher than the planes. from where I was standing,I could see that it was hovering near the northern area of Santa Ana, Ca. near the Mainplace mall. And It was about 5 to 7 degrees north of where the sun was.   This object moved very slowly, probably about 5 mph, in a shoutherly direction. The object was very Bright, but it seemed to shimmer between white and a coppery hue. I finally got back to my Bldg. In downtown Santa Ana. And I stood at our parking lot for another 15 min. until 1 o&#39;clock. So my sighting lasted about half an hour, and during that time it did not move anymore than maybe a couple of miles or so. (realize that this thing was so high,it looked like it barely moved). I came back out around 3 pm but it was gone at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Crazy thing is that the next day (Friday January 6th) I was off and my wife and I happened to drive to North Santa Ana, to the Mainplace Mall.  And as we parked in the rear parking lot on the top of the structure, I was curious and decided to look up, and THERE IT WAS AGAIN!! This happened at Noon too.  This thing whatever it was must have been spying on the Citizens of Orange county for a few afternoons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not look at it for long because I went into the mall, by the time I came back out (an hour later) it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always believed in UFO&#39;s but have never seen one until now, and it really gave me the creeps!  I almost felt like it was keeping an eye on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/5/06 12:00|Newport Beach|CA|Circle|1 1/2 hrs.|strange bright object observed at noon over southern california|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48882.html|199|ndxe200601| strange bright object observed at noon over southern california<n> <n><n> <n><n> First a little background... prior to this event, i had never seen what i could truly call a &#34;UFO,&#34; I always have been open to the possibility that these entities could exist in our universe... i try to approach these type of issues from a rational and logical perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, the other week I stepped outside my front door here in Southern California to light up a cigarette(i know, i know)...it was a really nice sunny day out for January, as I stood there I happened  to glance at the sky above me and i noticed an object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MY first reaction to seeing this was, &#34;what the hell is that?&#34;  I looked around and during this whole event no one on the streets seemed to notice and i have never heard any mention of it since in the media or elsewhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe what i thought i was seeing was like how planets can appear real bright at sun-up or sun-down.  The only problem was that it was around 12:00 in the afternoon.  The sun is very bright in So. Cal. at 12 noon even during winter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object did not move like what you think of in a zigzagging craft.  In fact, it moved rather slowly across the sky comparable to the moon&#39;s path across the sky that day which happened to be the only space object i could see that day.  Or, at least, it should have been the only thing i saw that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This started to lead me to believe that it was a satellite. However, i have been to the desert at night and seen satellites with my own eyes. It appears to me that satellites move across the sky at a good pace.  Am I wrong? Anyways, i observed this craft or object or whatever for about 1 1/2 hrs.  During this time, i was able to go in and out of my house, watch t.v., go out and check on it again...and i took some pictures...<n> <n><n> <n><n> What prompted me to write this was the reaction i got from friends and others when i showed them these images.  In the photos, you can see the bright object next to a cloud for perspective.  I have about 5 pictures of the object itself.  I also took a picture of the moon and an airplane during this time to give perspective on the object&#39;s shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this object is man-made my guess would be that it is a satellite with a shiny body and two dark panels on the side. The bright middle and dark sides is the characteristic shades/colors of this object.  My camera is only 3.2 megapixels, so i wish i had a more powerful camera that day.  Maybe it is a secret government spying satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly have no idea what this object may be...but it is certainly open to debate.  I had never seen the object before and I never have since and it doesn&#39;t keep me awake at night.  just thought others might be interested in my observation. That&#39;s ma story and im stickin to it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The ball was about half size in relation to the moon and the tail/flame was about 20 moon lenghts or if the fireball was about a mile or less away (as it appeared to be so) then the tail length may have been about half a mile long. My girlfriend also said she saw a few other colors (besides green) like blue and orange. After we saw it, we went to park and hoped to see maybe more of them, or a meteor shower if it was a meteor. We saw another person standing, a woman who we talked to - she said she witnessed it also and heard a boom in the ocean where it had crashed - she thought it was &#34;the military doing something strange&#34;. Shortly after the fireball, maybe 5-10 minutes later I saw a silent helicopter going along the coast, shining a light on the surface of the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left and went a few blocks away, close to my home on Vulcan ave in Encinitas. We sat in the car and talked about it, then my girlfriend looked up at the sky and noticed a long, thin trail of dust or cloud going in the same direction and angle as the fireball we saw. We watched it all night and it eventually grew bigger and dissapated. I have never seen a fireball like that before...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It went over my car where I couldn&#39;t see it so I pulled over and turned the car so I could roll down my window and confirm what I saw. I then saw it go over another neighborhood and move erratically  and stopping a couple times. All this time I could see airplanes in the sky up above which had flashing lights and were miles higher. This object only had 4 dim lights- no flashing. It seemed to go any direction it wanted.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 45 seconds later, I got a better, unobstructed view to the left - it was the same bright orange lights, but they appeared to be lighting up in a row from right to left. The lights never rose or fell, only lit up like balls of fire, remained lit for several seconds, then disappeared. I was knocking on the window to try and get people to come out. The lights showed up again even further to the left - this happened seven or eight times. One other person came out in time to see the entire final display - this last time was the clearest, and it looked like six balls of fire that lit up on a horizontal line (right to left), then disappeared - not moving up or down, just disappearing. Lots of airplanes were visible shortly afterwards, and one in particular that was moving in a large circular pattern. There was never any noise that I could distinguish as being associated with the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It took me half  a second to realize that it could not be a plane, than I started to yell at ((name deleted)) (who was with me) &#34;look, look&#34;. When he finally was able to see it, it was just a little past the sinking sun .The object was extremely black.  It absolutely reflected no sunlight and was amazingly dark and maintained this color throughout my observation.. In an instant after Dan realized what I was seeing he  ran  inside and told me to keep my eyes on it, so while he was gone I moved toward the other side of the yard to keep it in sight. all the time moving along the top most mountain ridge (in the direction of North-west) about 10-20 miles away over what I believe to have been following the Blue Ridge Parkway. The object carefully maintained a course to fly just above the top edges of the mountains peeking over Mt Pisgah. What stumped me most was that it was flying much too fast to be a conventional jet and it left absolutely no contrail at all. When ((name deleted)) got out of the house and handed me the binoculars the object had just gotten out of sight behind the far side of the sky from us. The whole sighting lasted about 30-35 seconds . When ((name deleted)) and I went back to ponder it he figured out that the object had been going about 8,000 m.p.h using google.earth, our location, and the duration of the sighting.<n>

It couldnt have been a jet (as we have military bases nearby)because the bright light would have been coming toward me,also there were no port and starboard lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My only other thought was that maybe it was the Space Station going over head in orbit. However a friend of mine said when you view the space station in the sky it appears stabilised.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I am not sure what it was, and I have not heard any other reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We looked for emergency vehicles and other cars that may have been in distress, but saw nothing. There was also a definate change in temperature. It was about 46 degrees when we returned home and I would have to hazzard a guess that the temperature jumped up to 60 or 70 degrees.

1/3/06 18:50|Aliceville/Carrolton/Livingston|AL|Sphere|1 hour|Greenish-Blue Sphere Shape Object Seen Over Alabama's Skies. People In Multiple Sites Witness Same Thing.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48607.html|219|ndxe200601| Greenish-Blue Sphere Shape Object Seen Over Alabama&#39;s Skies. People In Multiple Sites Witness Same Thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On yesterday evening, I observed 2-3 unusual objects in the sky. My trip began on U.S. Highway 82West as it leads out of Tuscaloosa, AL towards Columbus, MS. I made a left turn at the junction of U.S. Highway 82West and AL State Hwy. 86East. AL State Hwy 86 leads to the city of Carollton, located in Pickens county. Midway to the city of Carollton (a distance of some 20+/- miles from the junction of US Hwy 82 and AL State Hwy 86) I observed what appeared to be a &#34;shooting star&#34; pass from the right side of the sky to the left. I must point out here that my primary occupation requires me to drive extensively. As a result, the road(s) I was traveling on was very familar. In addition, since a great deal of my driving in general is done in the evening and night, the sight of &#34;shooting stars&#34; is equally as familiar. What made this particular &#34;shooting star&#34; stand out to me was the intensity of white light displayed as it tracked across the sky. So much so that I half expected to hear a thud or see some type of impact crator. Again, it must be stressed, that at that paticular point in my minds eye I had simply seen a &#34;shooting star&#34;, no more. After making what amounted to about a 20-25 minute stop, in Aliceville(a town about 12-15 miles past Carrolton), to complete some work, I proceeded to take AL State Hwy. 17South to reach the city of York, my destination in Sumpter County. As I reached the outskirts of the city of Aliceville, with the thought of the unusual &#34;shooting star&#34; still fresh in my mind, I observed yet another &#34;shooting star&#34;. This one, the second &#34;shooting star&#34;, tracked from left to right across the sky and emitted a somewhat dull pale orange color as it passed. Nevertheless, I was still of the mindset that the two objects I saw, less than an hour apart, were just &#34;shooting stars&#34;. In fact, I would probably still be of that opinion if I had not observed the third and most impressive object. I had been continuously traveling along AL State Hwy. 17South( i have to point out that this particular state hwy.runs almost parallel with the AL-MS state lines and serves as a lifeline to some of AL&#39;s most rural communities. there are very few lights of any kind, except when passing through one of the small rural towns aforementioned) and witnessed nothing at all unusual. That is until I arrived at the junction of AL State Hwy.&#39;s 17South and 28West where I made a left turn that would take me to the city of Livingston in Sumpter county. Almost immediately after turning on to AL State Hwy. 28East, I observed a spherical object in the sky to my right (this would have been along the South-South West horizon). Initially I thought that it was a star. The object was not illuminated in any intense way, but instead seem to emit a greenish-bluish glow or tinge. I slowed my vehicle to about 15-20 mph and to my amazement, I could see that this greenish-bluish object was hovering in the sky (as a point of fact it was moving so slow that it appeared to barely be moving at all). I looked around the sky and at first I saw nothing else in the sky besides the spherical object. Then a few seconds later I saw what I percieved to be a low flying airplane in the Eastern part of the sky. It, the low flying airplane(?)blinked about six times and then it was gone from view, but the sphere continued to leisurely hover about. I was able to view this spherical object in the sky about 10-15 minutes until I reached the junction of AL State Hwy. 28East andUS Interstate 20/59, which passes through the city of Livingston, in route to Meridian, MS(about 40 miles away). At about the time I reached the interstate either the spherical object had gone or it was obscured by the lights of cars, businesses, etc.. The conclusion, about 6 hours and 150+/-miles later someone who could not have known what I had seen, said very casually and somewhat jokingly, &#34;hey guys, I thought I saw a U.F.O. tonight&#34;. I let this person tell everyone present what they thought they saw. When other folks started laughing, i started crying because I knew that what I had seen was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I notice two rectangle objects flying way above the eagle/hawk.  I estimate the two to be about at least 6,000 feet in the air.  At first I thought it were a pair of turkey vultures that are found in the Monrovia area.  But the two objects were not flapping the wings.  The two objects would move closer to each and then move apart.  The two objects were high in the sky, yet it appears to be large.  I only notice the rectangle shape, there was not any thing protruding from the object at all.  The two objects were either black or dark gray in color.  They were flying from east to west.  The two objects left no trail of any kind, and I did not notice any sounds from the objects.  The two objects were about 70 to 80 degrees from horizon.

1/3/06 09:00|Fountain|CO|Unknown|5 min|Object hovered low over homes, we followed it for several minutes.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48702.html|224|ndxe200601| Object hovered low over homes, we followed it for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Tues. 01/03/06 about 9pm my son and I took the Fontaine exit off of I-25 and headed east towards Mesa Rd. As we approached the High School we say what first appeard to be a helicopter  by the way it hovered, then manovered a turn that went from heading west back east. My son witnessed the object and watched it also. I continued towards Mesa Rd watching this thing to figure out what it was because it didnt look normal to me. I reached Mesa Rd and it appeared to be decending next to Lowes but next thing I knew it turned south and flew forward low over the homes. At this point it seemed like it had a wingspan of some type and had alot more lights on. It flew above the homes about 20 or so feet it seemed. At that point it resembled a small plane and I continued down the road at about 45 miles per hour because I thought if it was a small plane in trouble it was going to crash.  I reached the end of the road and had lost track of it. I made a left and on the next road turned left again heading towards the homes.  I saw it hovering over a house a few blcks away.  It seemed every time I got close to it the thing would slowly move a block or two away. I had to find out what it was!  I cant explain the feeling I had at this point. I got real close and could see 2 sets of 3 lights clearly. I couldn&#39;t tell the shape but it looked like the light sets were formed in a triangle shape. I couldn&#39;t see a form- only the lights.   I stuck my head out of the window and could only hear my cars engine (Its a quiet engine). I struggled to make out a shape or size. I then thought of my camera phone and couldnt get in hand and working fast enough. It started moving again and all of a sudden sped south over a dark area ( maybe johnson resovior or a large field and headed south staying low and fast.  My son thought it was traveling at 100 mph, I would say it was 50-75mph.  I have a degree in accounting and I am the type of person that knows there should be a logical, scientific reason for everything but this overwhelmed me in a way nothing ever has.  I live in a military town and can reasonally believe it was some type of test flight of some kind, but I know I am constantly thinking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/3/06 06:00|Lantana|FL|Unknown|2 minutes|Red pulsating light seen in Lantana, Florida|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48575.html|227|ndxe200601| Red pulsating light seen in Lantana, Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just getting up as my husband&#39;s alarm went off for a day of offshore fishing.  I was laying in bed looking out towards the ocean through sliding glass doors. At this time, the sky was still dark and the horizon was just beginning to transition from night to sunrise, so stars were still out. A pulsating red light caught my attention and I asked my husband &#34;what is that red light?&#34;. We stared at it for a full minute, when we both witnessed it change to a smaller bright, white light which then proceeded to take off North in a straight direction until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
1/3/06 05:45|La Quinta|CA|Light|4 Minutes|Abnormally bright object moved across the night sky at very low altitude in a slow, momentumless "surging" fashion.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48585.html|228|ndxe200601| Abnormally bright object moved across the night sky at very low altitude in a slow, momentumless &#34;surging&#34; fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife woke me up this morning because she thought she heard a noise outside our house, such as a prowler or animal. I walked around the house to check on things and look out various windows into our front and back yards.  I ended up back in our bedroom where we have a set of French doors with windows looking into our back yard/Northern sky.  Immediately my eyes were drawn low into the sky where I saw an extremely bright white light.  It actually looked like a close cluster of lights rather than a single solid bright light. The object hung completely still, low in the sky.  My first though was that I was looking at a helicopter, but upon closer inspection there was simply too much light coming from this object.  With the distance it appeared to be at, 2 miles away, the area the light was occupying would have been about the same size as an entire helicopter. The light did not fade or grow in intensity either, so the object was not moving toward or away from me. It appeared to simply hover there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at it as it hung there in the sky for at least a couple minutes. I remember thinking that I wished it would move or turn so that I could get a better idea of what it was. You know, we all have a pretty good idea about how an airplane or helicopter should appear to move in the sky.  Although it looked and “felt” odd to me, I still wasn’t ready to call it a UFO.  My wife noticed I was still staring out the window and asked me what I was looking at.  Not wanting to sound crazy, I simply said “the sky”.  About 15 seconds passed after she spoke to me the object started to move, very slowly, to the east. It maintained its low altitude in a perfectly straight line as if it was on rails. I see airplanes in the sky from my back yard all the time. The amount of light this thing was putting out was simply abnormal, even if you consider the possibility that I was looking at airplane landing lights, or a helicopter “night sun” spot light pointed perfectly in my direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What finally made me think that I was not looking at an airplane or helicopter was the way it moved.  Its movement and acceleration was not smooth.  It would sort of surge forward a little, slow down, surge forward, slow down, surge, slow etc. The object’s total speed was very slow, so the surging was sort of subtle, but was still very noticeable.  It did not move smoothly across the sky as an airplane or helicopter with momentum would. I should also mention that’s it’s acceleration from stop to its “cruising speed” appeared instant and effortless. As for sound, it was silent.  There was no aircraft or other types of sound other than normal early morning ambient, which is pretty quiet in La Quinta, CA at this hour. We have a local small aircraft strip nearby about a half mile away, but the planes landing and taking off from there can be heard and seen quite easily. There was no wind this morning either, it was calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I wanted my wife to witness what I was seeing, so I said calmly to her, “want to see a UFO”? She was still awake from being startled by what she thought was a noise outside our house, and because I was still investigating. We were both very lucid.  She said, “There is no UFO”.  I then told her to come and look, and she could tell I wasn’t joking around, so she jumped right out of bed and walked over to me quickly. In our decade plus of marriage, I had never asked her to come and look at a UFO.  I pointed the object out to her, which wasn’t difficult, and she watched it move.  I told her to note how it was moving in a (for lack of better word) “surging” fashion, and that airplanes/helicopters do not move like that.  She agreed, and we watched the object disappear behind our neighbor’s roofline. After this I stepped outside and tried to get another glimpse of it, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s important to note, that if you look to the North from my back yard in La Quinta, you can see mountains, which are part of the San Andreas fault line.  The base of the mountain is only about 5-6 miles away from my house.  It was easy to see that the object wasn’t very far away, and was very low in the sky. If I had to guess at the altitude I would say 400 - 500 feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an IT professional, and my wife is an interior designer for one of the local home builders. I have an extremely open mind when it comes to subjects such as UFOs, but this is the first time in my life that I felt the need to report a sighting, and it’s the first time since childhood that I saw something in the night sky that was strange enough to qualify for me.  I am open minded, but also very analytical.  I wasn’t simply looking at a “bright light in the sky”.  What prompted me to make this report was how it moved, as described above.  If there is a logical explanation for how a “known” aircraft can exhibit a perfectly straight, visibly “surging”, very slow movement across the sky, I would like to know what it is.<n>

And as it was moving we saw it was the shape of a triangle. And it was not that fast it was glideing. And my brother looked back to get another look and it was gone. There where about 3 other cars by us and we a slowed down to see it and i would assume they saw it too. It was so weard and im not lieing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were no clouds or aircraft in the sunseting sky.  I looked in the vicinity of where the object was to see if it was an aircraft but then noticed how far off it was and realized it was huge.  The size of it is what got my attention.  By the size and how far off it was it had to have been over Mexico.  It seemed to morph from a cone shape into a circle.   I would not dismiss the possibility of it being a cloud. However the sky was totally clear in all directions and the shapeshifting happened in the course of about 5-7mins. But I am submitting this just in case there are more reports of the same sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a black speck in a relatively clear sky with some low cloud coverage. Object appeared stationary, no discernable movement was noticed; based upon the movement of the lower lying clouds, it appeared stationary. I observed said object for approximately 5 minutes before having to return to work. When I returned outside to look at it again, it was no longer there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The six lights were grouped into pairs, which at first, traveled together but then moved about eachother in random movements.  they were traveling from east to west.  One of the lights slowly began to fade away as if it were disappearing into the clouds.  Another set followed and eventually the last pair disappeared over our building.  all were silent, and no actual object was seen, only lights.  At that time I looked back to the east and notice a silent black object moving slowly just below the clouds.  Above this craft you cloud see a round light reflecting off the clouds.  at one point it appeared to stop and hover, but it eventually began to move on slowly. Again I looked to the east and seen a larger black object with the same reflecting light above, moving slowly. As we watched both, the first eventually disappeared on the over our roof, and the larger second followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax.

1/1/06 23:00|San Antonio/Laredo (between)|TX|Triangle|1: 45 minutes|Three separate sightins which ocurred in rural south Texas between 01/01/03 and 03/01/09.|6/9/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70393.html|239|ndxe200601| Three separate sightins which ocurred in rural south Texas between 01/01/03 and 03/01/09.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in various towns South Texas since 1999.  Since 2004, I have worked outdoors most if this time, mostly at night with minimal light pollution from large cities.  I have three separate sightings to report with no specific dates, regrettably.  All I cab say is that the first sighting occurred after 01/01/06 before 2007.  The second sighting occurred between 01/03/09 and 02/20/09.  The third sighting occurred between 04/01/09 and 05/15/09.  The first two sightings occurred while I was working.  The last sighting occurred during my off time.  I will recount my experiences here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three sightings occurred in the rural Texas landscape in between Del Rio, Texas to the west, San Antonio, Texas to the north, Corpus Christi, Texas to the east and Laredo, Texas to the south.  In between these four cities are smaller, rurally populated towns.  Outside of the towns are millions of acres of privately owned ranch land that is inaccessible to few consisting of ranch owners, their families, hunters and in areas closer to the Mexican border, the U.S. Border Patrol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’d like to emphasize that this area in between the aforementioned cities is sparsely populated and dominated by private land.  Also, after I had observed the objects in all three sightings, I believed the aircraft to be military.  The cities of Del Rio and San Antonio have Air Force installations.  The city of Corpus Christi has a Naval Air Station.  There is also a bombing range approximately 30 to 40 miles east of Cotulla, Texas on Farm to Market Road (FM) 624.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will report these observations as clearly and accurately as I can, devoid of any opinion or speculation.  I did mention earlier that I believed these objects to be military, but that’s based on the fact that these events occurred within the triangle of those installations where there are several remote miles to operate in without many eyewitness accounts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FIRST SIGHTING: I was with a coworker traveling westbound on the FM Road 133 which connects Artesia Wells, Texas (LaSalle County) to Catarina, Texas (County).  Both towns are sparsely populated and are surrounded by dense brush for several miles.  Artesia Wells is a town of probably 20 that is approximately 50 miles north of Laredo, Texas, outside of it’s city limits and maybe 90 miles outside of San Antonio, Texas.  Artesia Wells is on IH-35 in a heavily traveled stretch of highway that is relatively clo0se to the Mexican border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FM 133 is maybe 15 to 20 miles long and only runs from Artesia Wells to Catarina.  There are no tons in between Artesia Wells and Catarina.  Catarina has a population of maybe 50 or more, if not less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not certain as to the time of year, and do not want to speculate.  I do remember that I initially observed the object approximately 10 miles west of Catarina and thought that it was a low flying aircraft.  This was about 45 minutes before sunset.  Approximately 5 miles outside of Catarina, both my coworker and commented that the aircraft did not appear to be moving.  The object was several miles west of the FM 133 and Highway 83 intersection just south of Catarina.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be black in color, triangular shaped with no lights or visible markings.  The object did not make any sounds that I could hear.  Also, the object appeared to be hovering.  The object’s hover was not consistent with that of a helicopter in that a helicopter moves up and down and side to side as it hovers.  This object appeared to be perfectly still.  I did not notice and type of exhaust emitting from the vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My coworker and I attempted to get as close as we could to the object via dirt roads.  The dirt roads we were on took us due south and not west.  The object appeared to be hovering over brush.  From my position, I couldn’t identify any land monuments to pinpoint the object’s location.  There were only trees and plants below the object.  I still would like to say that my coworker and I were still around about 10 miles or so from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object until the sun set.  The object remained stationary for the duration.  My coworker and I attempted to get the object’s attention by pointing flashlights at it and using flashing lights while we were stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At sun set, the object became impossible to see with the naked eye.  I used night vision goggles to view the object.  With very little sub light being used as a light source, I could clearly see the object at the same location, still stationary.  My coworker observed the object through the night vision equipment as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this time that we left the area.  The object was not visible after sun set.  The object did not appear to have any lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SECOND SIGHTING: I was working alone near the Artesia Wells area between the hours of 2200 and 0100 hours when I observed lights in the sky.  I was traveling westbound on a rural ranch road one mile south of Artesia Wells and approximately one mile from IH-35 when I first saw a bright light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night, the sky was clear and there did not appear to be any clouds in the sky.  I was I was traveling westbound, a bright light that I can best describe as resembling a headlight caught my eye.  The light was very bright and flashed on and off before disappearing.  There appeared to be lights north of this light’s location; these lights seemed relatively close to the first light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the very bright “headlight” and the others for only a couple of seconds.  I continued traveling west until I reached IH-35.  I parked my vehicle, got out and attempted to signal the area where I observed the light with my flashlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at the intersection of IH-35 and FM 133 when I attempted to signal this light.  At this point the light was not visible.  I scanned the sky and observed a high flying aircraft that could have been a plane.  This object was traveling southbound on the east side of IH-35 but crossed over IH-35 traveling westbound.  Shortly after crossing over, the object began to travel north.  It took the object between 8-12 minutes before it disappeared out of sight due to distance.  Another aircraft appeared to be several miles behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my attention back to the west sky where I observed three high hovering objects.  These objects appeared to be in a triangular formation.  I could not make out any shapes or sizes.  The lights on these objects appeared to be consistent with conventional aircraft.  They omitted a white beacon every couple of seconds or so.  These objects did not appear to have the typical red port side light or green starboard side light that many aircraft and vessels have.  They remained stationary for several minutes, flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to signal these objects as well, to no avail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To characterize the initial object, I’d say it was about the size of a military flare.  I did not emit smoke and a shadow like military flares and did not appear to be descending under a parachute like a military flare.  It is best described as a single vehicle headlight in the sky.  This object was not a radio or cell phone tower light and was not a vehicle.  It was too high in the sky to be mistaken for vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This entire experience lasted about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THIRD SIGHTING: On this particular evening, I was traveling home from a shopping trip in Laredo, Texas with my family when my daughter, my wife and I observed an object in the sky.  I was at about the 27 mile marker of IH-35, two miles south of the Border Patrol checkpoint when I observed 4 to 5 bright lights, lined up within three to four times their width from each other.  These objects appeared to be in a much disciplined formation.  These objects appeared consistent with the object I saw in my second sighting.  The objects were very bright and appeared similar to headlights.  They flashed off sequentially, starting with the southern most light.  These lights were in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately notified my wife and daughter and they too saw the lights.  I did not stop to investigate or signal to them.  I continued traveling northbound until arrival at the Border Patrol checkpoint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 27 mile marker is approximately 27 miles form the Mexican border.  The lights appeared to be hovering over rural densely brushed and sparsely populated ranches.  There are no major towns or cities northwest of Laredo, Texas that would line up directly west of the 27 mile marker.  The nearest town would be Catarina which is several miles north of Laredo on Highway 83.  The next nearst town would be Encinal, which is 39 miles north on IH-35.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

There were four red spheres about one meter in diameter hovering over the back yard of a home on the street we were driving on.  They looked like they were big lights on a pole, but when we slowed down to look at them they rose higher into the air and went into a formation with one about a 100 feet above the ground with the other three just over the tree tops.  We followed them as they went out to the boulevard and began flying lower and in a seemingly systematic pattern over the neighbourhood.  Another vehicle stopped on the street and was observing the red &#34;balls of light&#34; as well.  They continued slowly flying over the neighbourhood for about 15 or 20 minutes until they went up and over a hill and out of sight.  My friend who was with me at the time seemed strange afterwords and did not wish to discuss what we had seen.  Also he deleted the pictures he had taken of the objects from his cell phone camera a few minutes after he took them.  He would not explain why he did this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She alerted me and my long time friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a fleet of ufos with white and red lights.  The lights were in a diamond pattern, three lights were white and one that blinked red on the front side of the diamond.  These lights did not blink like beacons on commercial aircraft.  The white ones were a very fast strobe and/or a shuttering effect with the red light blinking a steady pulse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were stopped at the 177 and 62 junction for more that 25 minutes with the headlights off.  It was partly cloudy, but mostly clear skies.  I saw 12- 25 of these craft looking to the south and they were headed to the south west.  I saw some come from the southeast horizon, some were above us but they were all headed in the same direction.  We sat there in amazement.  We got out of the van for about 5-10 minutes, but it was cold so we jumped back in.  My friend had cleaned all the windows before we left so it was crystal clear.  About 5 or 10 minutes before we started driving again, we saw a dark cloud about the size of 3 football fields flashing a white light every other second or so.  The light was flashing from inside the cloud.   The size of the light was about 60-100 feet in diameter.  This lasted about 5-8 minutes.  It seemed to be heading in the same direction as the other aircraft.   I would say we saw anywhere from 30-50 crafts in this fleet.  Amazing.<n>

We had been in Arizona to bring in the New Year.  We were driving on Hwy 62 West about 2 miles from the 177 when I noticed a strange object with strobing lights appear to the North.  At first, I thought it might be an airplane, but then, it did a complete backflip.  I told my friends there was a spaceship beside us.  The object moved at such a high rate of speed and then would suddenly stop or make circles.  When we got to the 177, there is a 3 way intersection and we decided to stop.  We watched the object for a minute or two and my friend noticed another one to the southeast.  Amazed, we watched.  My friend got out to relieve himself when he told me to get out.  As I got out, I noticed one directly above our heads.  The were 4 lights on the underbelly of the craft.  There was one red and 3 white strobing lights seeming to make a diamond shaped pattern.  The craft hovered there for about 15 seconds or so and propelled forward.  We then looked to the southeast and saw 10 more or so more objects moving toward the southwest in no particular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were clouds in the sky because we really couldn&#39;t see the stars that well, but these objects were flying below the cloud layer.  We stayed parked there for about  30 minutes with the lights off.  There were a handful of other cars on the highway so there were no distractions from other headlights.  We saw probably 25-50 aircraft that night while we were parked.  Truly amazing.  There was so much activity.  Before we started driving again we saw a huge dark cloud directly above us.  It was flashing a huge light from inside the cloud.  The object seemed to be going in the same direction as the other aircraft to the southwest.  I will send a map of the area along with a drawing of the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, we thought it was a large aircraft with it&#39;s landing lights on, heading westbound toward Tulsa International Airport. As we continued to observe the light, we noticed that it did not move. We were able to get out of our car and watch the light for an hour, and it never changed position in relation to us, the horizon, or any other observable object, while the stars progressed across the sky as normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object is obviously geosynchronus as it has been in the same position in the sky visible at the same basic time every morning for three months. The only time it is otherwise visible is on Monday nights, when it is visible all night long. It is not visible any other night of the week until approx. 04:30am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have written NASA asking what this might be, but have received no response from them.

They moved in perfect unison. At approximately 30% from eye level; they/it stopped for a short while before each light rotated very quickly; but as if connected to one another; in perfect time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They/it then moved to above our heads in a very swift movement; stopped for a short while and then proceeded to rotate in a spherical movement; (over and around each other) but as if one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#39;UFO&#39;then stopped motionless for a few moments before &#34;shooting&#34; into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although the night was very quiet and the sky was clear, there was no sound and the &#39;Ufo&#39; left no trail.<n>
1/1/06 00:06|San Francisco|CA|Light|15 minutes|I saw 4 groups of small glowing orange lights generally traveling North, one of which made a manuever impossible to any known aircraft.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48662.html|253|ndxe200601| I saw 4 groups of small glowing orange lights generally traveling North, one of which made a manuever impossible to any known aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 35 year old legal assistant and my girlfriend is a 25 year old waitress.  We went up to my roof on New Years Eve with the idea that we might catch the last of the celebratory fireworks going off in the downtown or marina area of San Francisco.  We saw a little bit of fireworks but not much.  We decided to say on the roof for a moment to enjoy the stars.  It had been cloudy and raining for days and having a clear sky was something special that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly we saw 3 or 4 glowing orange lights moving North almost directly overhead.  They were small, about the size of your thumbnail, and unblinking.  By definition, these were of course UFO&#39;s.  They were not like any other flying object either one of us had seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed in place on the roof watching the sky to see if anything else appeared and about 1 minute later we saw the same thing.  These were also travelling North.  Again, maybe 4 minutes later we saw a larger group headed North.  This time I remembered to count them.  There were 8 of them.  This time I was watching very intently to see if there was any movement that would show them to be using anti-gravity technology.  I was looking for any sudden sharp turns or accelerations.  There was one object that made a sudden change of course.  It had been traveling in a 3 o&#39;clock position to an object then suddenly moved to a 6 o&#39;clock position.  There is no way any known aircraft could have made that maneuver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 6 minutes after that we saw 2 more of the same lights traveling East.  We waited another  10 minutes then we began to get cold and went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
