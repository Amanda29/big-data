I was standing outside when the sky above turned black.  The contrast between the craft and the sky was what made me look up. I have never seen anything so black before,  The craft covered the entire house at one point and only flying at treetop level. The thing did not make a sound! It had bright lights on each point and a large light in the middle. I could not move for about 10 seconds, just out of total disbelief.  I then ran inside the house screaming for anyone who was home and was only able to grab my mother who went outside and also observed the craft.  The craft was moving so slow, and so low I could have hit it with a rock. It proceeded east crossing over the New York State Thurway, not making a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I&#39;ve been telling folks for years of my sighting,   they came from the east and stopped about 20-30 feet from us , they were the size of a car,silent blinked lights  at us ,very bright red  many times taking turns with each other then one would shoot straight up hundreds of feet in a blink of the eye then return back and the other copy this motion also  . They were playing with us I felt,  then they slowly moved west at the end of our street under a lamp post they merged into one and  became a large circle of colored lights then went into itself, gone in an instant just gone   Maybe a minute later 2 military jets flew over our house. I waited to hear if anyone saw them on the news. no reports  . could not see anything , just the light no body a very slight electric feel.  I made a report to the UFO reporting in San Diego<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/30/91 14:30|Whitefish|MT|Disk|15minutes|Flying Saucer from north (Canada) descends on Whitefish, Montana, hovers silently, gone like a bullet.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67820.html|3|ndxe199106| Flying Saucer from north (Canada) descends on Whitefish, Montana, hovers silently, gone like a bullet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all, I was a skeptic’s skeptic.  My father and three relatives were on their way to a lodge meeting one Monday evening in 1947, near Lewistown, Montana.  Dad was excited as could be the next day relating how they saw the lights of the &#34;flying saucer&#34; (I’d never heard the term UFO at that time.) and they pulled the car into an approach, shut it off and all got out to observe the gyrations these lights were performing, close by--and without a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thoroughly embarrassed for Dad, his two brothers and nephew, and didn’t relate the incident to ANYONE.  That is until some years later, when strange things were happening near Great Falls, when a TV newsman caught several UFOs circling around Great Falls; and later incidents at Minuteman Missile sights in central Montana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the year was 1990 or 1991.  I don’t remember but it likely late spring to early summertime.  I went to the &#34;coffee shop&#34; near the viaduct in Whitefish, where I met the retired GNRY workers I enjoyed having coffee with, and listening to their stories of &#34;steam railroad&#34; in years past.  I was sitting with three GNRY retirees.  I was facing Big Mountain, the local ski resort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed a very shiny (shinier than chrome) &#34;airplane&#34; coming into sight above Big Mountain, approximately 15 miles from where we sat.  (I used to have a friend who owned an old 140 Cessna aircraft, which he used to polish and buff.)  Since it was confusing to me, I mentioned to the three others at our booth, &#34;I see a UFO flying toward Whitefish.&#34;  I was kind of kidding, but it soon proved quite true.  By this time it was probably about 5 miles?   We watched the &#34;airplane&#34; descending and the closer it got, it was obvious at the slow cautious speed it traveled, that it was no &#34;Cessna aircraft,&#34; but rather a very thin disk.  (It appeared as though one took two &#34;cymbals&#34; and placed one atop the other, it would replicate the shape we were seeing.  There was slightly more &#34;cabin&#34; underneath than on top.)   I would estimate the width of the total craft to be 75’ in width.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the kitchen and told the owner and his wife we were observing a UFO nearing Whitefish.  The 6 of us went outside to watch this situation.  The UFO came to a stop about ¾ of a mile from us, hovering above (best guess?) Wisconsin Avenue or the east edge of Whitefish Lake when it began hovering about 250-300 feet above the ground.  We observed it in a noiseless, standstill hover for approximately 5 minutes.  Then it took off in a northeast direction, although approximately straight up.  I’d estimate it was out of Earth’s atmosphere in less than five seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sadly the three GNRY retirees have passed away.  The restaurant owner and his ex-wife are still living.  We discuss that day every time I see him.  The incident was reported in the main Kalispell newspaper the next day on the front page.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that I’m retired, I plan to go to the Montana Historical Society and go through those years of newspapers on videotape and try to find that story for my own satisfaction; now that I have to defend my status as a former skeptic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My mother, sister, brother and my self were out side enjoying a cup of coffee and another sunny California morning, as I was gazing at a spot in the bright blue sky about ½ mile above us,  when a translucent cloudy dirty spot appeared which continued to grow in size and dept of color , I was puzzling over this when a Ufo appeared,  I start yelling look look to my Sis and Mom, who missed the event because they had their backs toward the  translucent opening in the sky, but my brother who was  facing the same way I was saw  the Ufo as the same time as Im yelling for them to look, then the UFO moving what appeared to be thousands of miles an hour appeared  from the south in a zigzagging  pattern  enters the translucent  dirty spot and disappears from sight and another UFO come shooting out of the same translucent  dirty spot..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As i moved to the house, I noticed that the lights started moving towards me.  My guess is that it was about an 40 yard walk.  The object drew nearer to my house at a very steady rate.  I ran about 10 yards to the door just being freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of panic i rushed in and yelled for my father who was sitting in his chair.  He immediatley got up and both of us proceeded to go out on front porch.  At my surprise the object was directly above us.  This is where my opinions differ from other reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object flew from the mountains it looked flat, like the oters reported, all 3 lights were horizantal.  When we got out on the porch, the object was above us and the lights were then vertical, as if it completely turned on it&#39;s side.  There was no noise.   The object seemed to be about the length of a football field. I ran into house to get a video recorder which is where this got scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned to the porch, lights still there, it was like an ery feeling in the air.  We had a barn with horses in it. These horses (apprx. 4) were screaming-not normally.  They were kicking the walls.  There screams were terrorizing and as this continued there were also dogs up the road that were carring on too! As i went to record this the object just vanished. within minutes everything seemed back to normal. This is something that my father as well I, have never discussed with anyone! One out of fear of what we saw and heard, two--the normal, we&#39;re nuts column.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived in Centreville, PA along rt 220 (I-99). Between 2 mountains-- one is called Wills Mountain, not sure of the other.  There are also 2 dams thereas well. (Koont&#39;z Lake). Centreville lies between Bedford, Pa (about 15 miles) and Cumberland, Md (about 15 miles).  It&#39;s a very small town, mostly farm and woodlands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not live here no more but do live in Bedford, Pa.  My father resides in Cumberland, Md.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These statements ARE true. The lights were big red circlular lights.  I have never seen an aircrat of that size-speed-or quiteness. Nor one that would turn sideways and just hover there with no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, thanks for your time to read, i am not looking for publicity. I have seen multible reports of similar objects and wanted to add this viewing. Again thank you!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Suddenly, the light inside my car turned on. I looked up in the sky and suddenly saw very very bright light object (right side) behind the tree near my car.. That tree blocked my view from seeing it, but it SPED sooooo fast! It was not a fireball or meteor or falling star. I was stunned and was terrified since I never saw it before..I normally see falling stars but not like that before. The strange thing was before I saw very very light object, I had weird dreams two times about seeing very beautiful flying saucers flying around my house!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

They were working in an orchard above Okanogan, WA on a sunny, cloudless day around the end of July in 1991 and had just stopped for lunch when they observed a silver object hovering silently in the sky above the hills that border Okanogan city to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness states the silver object shined brightly in reflected sunlight and appeared to be hovering at a height of between a half a mile and a mile above the ground at a distance of about a mile or so from them.  At that distance, it appeared about a half an inch in diameter to the observers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He says that the object seemed to shimmer in the sun like a mirage in the desert and that it was spinning on an axis like a coin one might spin on a table top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of this movement, it was difficult to tell if the outline of the object was a disk or triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 2-3 minutes, the object moved north and then shot straight up very quickly and disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> END OF REPORT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It had  what seemed  to be a  platform  with a disk for a cover.  the craft did  with  2  portals.  and a white to blue  light was shining down in the  area  of that same thing.<n>

(from the entrance to the camping area was about 2 miles).  we got scared so we ran all the way back.  the car pulled in and didn&#39;t stop.  they just left.  we thought they might have been following the craft.  it sure looked that way.  from the time we went out in the field to the time we got back only about half an hour had gone by, maybe 40 min., but when i checked the time it was 1:30 in the morning.  that&#39;s over 3hrs. unaccouted for and both of us were shocked and scared.  we didn&#39;t get any sleep that night.  the next day when we drove out of there we noticed the name of this area is called thomas landing. my name is thomas.  i thought that was weird.  also when we got back on a major highway we had passed dover air force base.  we both thought that was weird also and considered making a report but chose not to.  we went home to pa..   there are other pertinent details that i left out.  minor but significantly and coincidently relative to this account.  p.s. when i asked my friend how he knew it was about to come over the trees, he said he saw it shoot down from the sky to behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

(about 10 miles S. from Collingwood Ont.) It was a clear night, with tons of stars.  I woke my son who was sleeping in the front seat to witness this.  This object, it was positively masssive, blotted out the whole night sky!  It travelled in a south westerly direction for a few moments - then, at hypersonic speed disappeared.  I have studied UFOs since I was a child, and I&#39;ve seen quite a few - never in awe, surprised, or dismayed of any sighting - but this was spectacular.  The size of this object is difficult to estimate; but it had to be at least the size of 4 football fields - it blotted out all the stars in the sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Did not stay long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happened when I was in Job Corps at the Gainesville Job Corps Center. It was dark, and me and one of my good friends had to retrieve something from the woods surrounding the Center (of course, we weren&#39;t allowed in the woods, but we went anyway). We were walking towards where we had our campsite and my friend stopped me suddenly. &#34;Check it out! Two werewolf (?) type beings just floated across!&#34; He shouted. I was looking down at the time, so I cannot acknowledge if he indeed saw this. We continued on when we spotted a UFO on the ground, barely discernable. The shape of it was roughly that of a saucer. It was doing nothing, just sitting there, silent. Strangely, no lights or anything else that could provide illumination was present on, around, or near it. It was more like we could see it since our eyes were adjusted to the dark (Since we didn&#39;t really want to get caught, we had no flashlights). We advanced slowly, hoping to get a closer look at it. No such luck. We stopped in our tracks when we realized it had disappeared! We glanced at each other, and moved on. We got close to where our material was when something compelled me to get out of there and FAST. I took off running and my friend was not too close behind. As I was running, I looked over my shoulder and spotted a tall, dark, large-headed being with a dark robe on and it&#39;s hands folded in front of it. I did not stop to talk to it or get any closer. I just wanted out of there. That&#39;s about it with this one.<n>

My best friend was staying over for the night. Him and i went out at around 3am to go swimming at the club house swimming pool. (Yes it was closed, but we would jump the fence and swim anyway...i paid dues for the right to swim so i was going to do it when i wished.) As we came about two hundred yeards for the pool fence, we saw a large streak of light go across the sky, similar to a comet type firework. The color was green, like green flames, so we though someone shot a firework of some sort that did not make any kind of report. (Report as in sound) (I am not saying this is related to the craft to come, however a link is possible, even though i cannot say that there is in fact a link between them.) I do not know how long my best friend and i had been swimming before leaving, i would estimate an hour. We were talking in detail about many things like friends do, and we decided to stay outside until we had finished talking. My parents room was right above mine, and talking in a normal voice is easily heard from their room. So, we sat on my car in the drive way and continued our convercation. Now, i began to notice what i thought was a street light being obstructed by something else out of my peripheral vision. Like trees blowing and disrupting the light. However, i took note that there was no wind blowing, and so not enough to move any tree branches. So then i started looking to see what it was that was blocking the light at times. When i began to focus on the light, i then realize it was not a street light to begin with....and the source of this light was moving. (Coming at us.) I will not post my exact words, i said something to the effect of, &#34;What is the world is that?&#34; My best friend and i walked to the middle of the drive way to get under this objects flight path, or as close as we could guesstimate. It was at this point we got an idea of how fast this object was moving. I have no frame of reference, so i cannot tell you how fast it was moving. I have never been to an air show and have not seen a fighter jet make a low level, high speed pass. This craft was flying about 100 feet off the ground. As it came closer, i noticed the light source was a large tube coming from the bottom of the craft, and it was a clear tube. The light itself was amber in color, and it illuminated the bottom of the craft. The tube was about one third the size of the bottom of the craft, and the tube was located in the center. The illumination was not a brilliant light, it was dull, just like what you would expect from a street light at a distance in the color amber. You could clearly see the tube as being clear, and the light contained with it. I have no idea what material the craft was made of, other than to say it looked dark from the illumination of the amber light. I saw nothing but the tube and what it illuminated because the tube was my main focus. I could not take my eyes off of it. It was moving at a very fast rate, and from the time we took real notice and moved up the drive way all took about one minute. This craft made no audible sound....not even a whisper. And the craft was about the size of...i am having trouble relating its size.....if you were to cross two streched limousines . (make a cross of them) As it went over us and past my house, my best friend and i ran to the back of my house and up the balcony in the back to watch it for as long as we could before it went out of sight. When i first realized it was a craft, a craft i believed to be alien, my first impulse was to run back to my car and jump under it. Hey i am not ashamed to admit it scared me. During the whole encounter, neither friend nor myself spoke a word after we saw what the craft was. Both of us were in shock, and we did not speak for around 5 minutes after the craft had been gone. When we went into my house, we both took note that it was 5:50am. The pool was only about a 10 minute walk away. I do not claim anything happend other than what i just reported. I do not believe anything other than that happend. I cannot account for that large time loss, although as i said, i do not know how long we were swimming, nor do i know how long we talked on my car. The green streak was moving from the North West heading South East. The craft was moving east to west. I do not know if they were connected as said before, but i do not deny the possibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/15/91 03:00|Galconda|IL||several occasions|Class III Encounter|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51474.html|18|ndxe199106| Class III Encounter<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening I thought I &#34;dreamed&#34; several aliens came into a cabin I was staying in with my girlfriend. Early the following morning I awoke, and described to my girlfriend my strange &#34;dream&#34;. She went on to tell me that she had the same dream, and that she had been taken to a spacecraft out in the field that abutted the cabin area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my &#34;dream&#34; I was awoken by 3-5 alien &#34;greys&#34;. Their featureless faces were only illuminated by the reflections from their black eyes. I remember sitting up in bed, holding the covers up to face so that only my eyes were exposed. They came towards the me, and one seemed to be holding some strange, &#34;jewel&#34; encrusted &#34;wand&#34;. It was gold, and had red and green &#34;crystals&#34; that may have been used to control the device. I think it was this device that was used by the aliens to disrupt my memory of the events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next evenining my girlfriend woke me up very late at night, terrified. She said they were back, and she did not want to do with them. Immediately I became aware of a very low frequency &#34;humm&#34; which was coming from somewhere outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is where it gets strange, since it was a waking memory,and I remember it as a waking memory -- My actions that that point on seem bizarre and irrational to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out onto the porch to see if there was anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a VERY bright light shining through the trees that separated the space around the cabin from a large overgrow field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at this point I think the aliens, again, used their mind machine, or my own brain was just going into shock over seeing such a bright light shining from this isolated field. We were mile and miles from anything! The cabin we were in had no electricity, no water, and the closest neighbor wwas several miles down a dirt road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was like my rational mind kicked in to convince me that what I was seeing was not real. I thought it could be some kids on ATVs, or we were hearing the sound of a far away generator, or that someone was simply playing a joke on us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From that point on I can&#39;t remember much. I don&#39;t remember going back to the cabin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I woke up early in the morning and went out to the field to see if there was anything. Out were the bright light seemed to be emitted from there were eight concentric circles pressed into the grass and mud. These were not like crop circles, but appeared as if something had pressed into the ground. The outer circle was approximately 40ft in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

We were almost home, and as I was looking up at the sky I noticed an intensly lit object.  It was small, because it was at a pretty high altitude.  It looked like two balls attached to each other by a rod (i.e. O-O)  It moved around erraticly with apparently random course.  Then, it streaked off to the south at a speed faster than any airplane would ever be able to reach.  Then it was gone.  I didn&#39;t say anything to my mom, but in later years I have mentioned it to my brother.<n>

Traveling east on I80 i started to approach the Mifflinville bridge. At 710 i seen this Large round bright green light flying above the river. i thought it was a plane cause the Bloomsburg airport was near by. I knew it could not fly above the river cause of the islands in it. the object was about 100 feet in diameter and was quiet.It flew above the water about 40 feet. By the time i got to the middle of the bridge the object made a hard 90 degree turn and flew over the mountain right above the trees. now going south. when i went home i told my father about it. he believed me. the next day in the paper was a writing about green lights seen in Washington DC at 715 pm the same night i seen my light. they said that it was a meteor. tell me this how can a meteor fly up a river then make a left turn before hitting a bridge and then fly over a mountain abofe the trees heading south in the direction which DC is in. There are two airports where i live and they are both 20 miles away from my house one of them should have something. It was no meteor.It was no plane.As far as i know i was the only one that saw it.<n>

Slowly like someone was pulling a window blind up, ever foot there was nothing there and u coild see the heat coming off it as it dissapeared..until it was completely gone...I thought about this for a while now...they where flying around the night sky when the sun came up somebody forgot to turn on the cloaking devices..this seem too take forever watching this thing and i reported it...to some web site in 1991 and was emailed back saying don&#39;t tell anybody about this<n>

I have 3 incidents that I believe have made me more open minded than ever.  Here are may sightings............<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  I was around 10 give or take 2 years when my friends and I were walking down the B and O railroad tracks behind my house.  We entered the town of West Wyoming and as we past our favorite and Only outside movie screen.  We got near some field by the tracks and saw a burnt area.  So my 3 friends and I went and checked it out.  When we approached the area it looked like a perfect circle with a circumference around 25 feet !!  As we searched the circle the grass and weed structures were bent in perfect harmony.  I did not remember if there was a smell.  We were intrigued when a police cruiser came to the spot and told us we would have to leave so as we were just fooling around in the field we left.   But I never forgot that spot and never went back..  As I drive on a road near that spot I think of the spot every now and then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  I was with a friend named ((name deleted)) down Wyoming avenue  in Kingston at twilight near Cook&#39;s Pharmacy when we noticed 3 bright lights in a triangle about 500 yards in the sky.  The lights took a slight left turn and headed toward the river,  So we followed.  We could see the lights and when we reached the river near the cross valley extension they turned north up the river descended and went toward the river itself and whoosh ....the 3 bright lights disappeared near the  river.  ((name deleted)) never talked about this and never denied or said a word when I discussed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  It was a beautiful early morning ( 6 am.) ((name deleted)) and I went fishing at Harvey &#39;s Lake a 25 minute drive from home.  We were out the night before got little sleep because we planned this a few days ago.  So we went to a a big rock across from Hanson&#39;s Park ( you can see the old ricketty rollercoaster ) around a quarter mile across.  There is a patch of hill than a stone patio next to dock we have permission to fish from.  we decided to setup on the patio.  As we fished you could see the street light across the way by the park.  So we fished and some time later around a hour or two I noticed that the light didn&#39;t go out and seemed a little closer.  I thought nothing of it and fished some more.  Then I noticed it closer than BAM.......... I looked up in the sky and saw a Black object hoovering oh so slow above us moving toward our back.  It looked like no UFOs I saw in books and other source before.  The shape was like a small triangle in front with another bigger triangle behind it. I have a attachment drawing it was all black.  AS I ran to the road that circumferences the lake the craft went slowly out of sight.  When I ran back to Steve he looked bewildered ,  I said;  hey man did you see that and he just keep fishing with a sort of nod. O asked him what time it was he said 10:30 am.. A hour or two disappeared !!  It sort of freaked me out and excited me at the same time.  Again Steve would not talked about the incident and that was that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My mother was saying goodbye to her boyfriend outside because he worked for Newsday and was going to work.  My mothers boyfriend was at the end of my driveway (I heard this after the fact because I was still inside watching TV) and said come over here and take a look at this to my mother, when she came to the end of my driveway and looked into the sky where he was pointing she yelled &#34;Oh my god&#34; and ran inside to get me and screamed into the house &#34;((name deleted)) there is a UFO outside&#34; ((name deleted)) there is a UFO outside&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking that my mothers boyfriend had some prank in store for me when I went outside I followed her out the door she ran into the middle of the street where her boyfriend was now standing and when I reached the point where I can see it in the sky I was in awe.  It was a spaceship about the size of a football field hovering but moving very slowly to the right.  The ship made no sound and looked similar to the ship from close encounters of the 3rd kind. I saw the ship briefly because it was between two houses mine and my neighbors and it finally made its way between the trees and at that very moment my dog ran out the door that I left open and took off down the street.  My mother told me to get into the car and her boyfriend left in his car and we took off in the direction that the UFO would have been from where we saw it.  We traveled in the car and got as far as route 110 in farmingdale but we never seen the UFO again. My dog was in front of my house upon our return about an hour later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to school the next day, I was 16 at the time and told my story to my class in Science which was appropriate since my teacher was pretty &#34;out there&#34;.  I was laughed at from my class when a girl in my class who never spoke said &#34;Oh my god my mother saw the same thing last night and I thought she was crazy&#34;.  The girl lived on Prairie Lane two blocks over from my location on Chapel Lane. The class got pretty shocked and I felt validated in my class and started to say &#34;see I told ya&#34;.  After school I was walking home from school with my two friends telling them about my experience the night before and telling them about what happened in my class but still was continued to be made fun of.  My friend lived on Saddle Lane one block from where I lived and when I walked into my door my phone rang and it was my friend I just walked home with and he said &#34;first off don&#39;t tell me I told you so but my neighbor ran over to me when I got to my house telling me that his father seen a UFO last night with the same description as me and at the same time that it happened to me&#34;.  I told him I told you so and that is the last time anything has came from this story but it has changed my life.  One thing I can tell anyone reading this is that it wasn&#39;t a blimp, plane, or helicopter it was a spacecraft and if I had it on film it would be the best footage of a UFO ever captured by far.  For months after I stood at my driveway with my camcorder waiting for a return of the UFO but it never was seen again I am now 33 years old.<n>

Then out of nowhere, a mercury color UFO starts following us.  It is outside window, driver side.   MY ex-husband is driving.  It seemed to me as if teenagers showing off a new ride.  This UFO is about 3 times bigger than our truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no noise.  It hovered next to us, then in front of us, then disappeared.  Then  giant mothership followed us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost an hour of time, then 3 weeks later was followed  by men in black.  Then had night -mares, then woke up with marks on my back.  And when I was six years old I was carried  by Bigfoot though I don&#39;t know if these two stories are connected in anyway.<n>

It was dark in color - like a dark grey and was very loud.  So loud that it caught my attention from inside my apartment on the 15th floor of a high rise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It  stayed in one place for the entire time I watched it (about 30 minutes) and was very close to the building.  I was amazed that other people did not hear the noise and come out to see what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was determined to watch it  and would take my eyes off of it.  I got tired, and after a while I grabbed a pillow to lie on my floor and watch it to see how it would move and what it would do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fell asleep and it was  gone  when I awakened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was one of the two strangest  things  I had ever seen up to that time because it appeared to be too heavy to be just hovering (actually, comopletely still) in the air, so close to me,  making so much noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was not smooth, but sort of  oval-round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have  never heard of any object like this and wonder if any other person out there has  seen anything similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

At about 15 miles West of Wendover, Utah, it was getting dark but I could see a black triangular ship slowly come across my windshield view from behind.  There was no sound, and the object had very large, orange-colored, circular lights which had a &#34;glow&#34; instead of a firey appearance.  The ship was so huge it filled up my windshield as I craned my neck to watch.  It moved slowly, gliding and bouncing slightly at times as though floating.  As it continued on past me, I saw that it was flying in the shape of a backwards &#34;L&#34; with five lights as described above, ie. three lights to the right, and two going straight up.  It was about 2000-3000 feet in altitude.  It sped up very fast after passing me, and I could see six F-14&#39;s that were starting to chase it.  They looked like flies compared to the size of the craft.  The whole ensemble continued straight ahead over Hwy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 80 toward Utah until out of my sight at the horizon.  I estimate the size of the craft at one and a half miles wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

About 10 to 20 miles before the Arizona, California border at Yuma we stoped at a rest area.  It was a hot afternoon and we all had to stretch our legs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember who spotted them first but we all witnessed them.  Across the Interstate 10 (north) about a mile from the road was a red and white water tower.  The type used at airforce bases.  We saw 3-4 orange objects about 500 to 1000 feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was weird was that they were not moving and they emited smoke slowly abouve them.  Each light would (burn) for about 8 minutes and then disapear.  As soon as one would burn out another one would apperar only in a different spot and remain still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know the length of this event because after about 15-20 minutes we left to Arizona.  But I remember still watching those lights while the sun went down and we drove away.  Some people I&#39;ve talked to say it was a flare, and I think that is a good answer.  But I know that flares slowly desend or shot up and come back down.  Why did these objects remain still and not drop or desend slowly?<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I want to know is what those were and were they flares that never heard of before.  I would really love to hear from you guys.  Also I have the entire insident on VHS tape and my family can give details too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you are interested in this please e-mail me and I will send you a copy of the tape.<n>

The craft had blue and red lights, and came from the sky, settling over the highway, very close to the ground. It sat for a second then slowly moved south, moving into the yard of a small home that sits right at the end of the airport, and next to the highway. There was a thunderstorm beginning and there was alot of high lightening. Our community was also having their July 4th fireworks display. As i approached the spot where the craft had entered the yard, i stopped my vehicle right in the highway, opened my door and stood outside looking at the craft sitting just above an electrical or telephone wire that was going into the home from a pole next to the highway. My passenger stayed in the car and watched from the passenger side. The craft sat motionless above the wire. It was round and metallic gray in color (dark grey)with a smokey glass dome shape in the center bottom of the craft. It was no bigger than a large car in diameter, and it was not as thick as a car would be. It didnt look big enough for a human to sit in upright. The lights of the craft were pulsing from the edges of the craft, and appeared to be coming from inside. They did not look like they were like our lights would be like on a car. They were pulsing and growing dimmer. I was approx. 40 feet away from the object, and we watched it until the lights dimmed out completely. When they were completely out, if you didnt know it was there, it would have been extremely hard to see. My passenger began to scream and stomp her feet on the floor of the car, and I felt like i was coming out of a trance or something. I jumped in the car, had much difficulty getting it into gear, (it was still running) and left as fast as i could. We did not talk at all for most of the drive to work, (25 miles) and when we did, we were trying to explain it, trying to convince each other that it could be something from this earth. We both had been in a state of shock. Bye the time on my car clock, I knew we had watched the craft for approx 10 mins. My passenger and I both worked as machine operators for a major manufacturer in Rochelle Ill. 2 years later, I became a Training Coordinator for the plant, teaching trainers how to train properly, creating training manuals and training materials, and also taking care of any issues or problems that may come up during a training period.  My passenger worked for approx 1 more year, then moved out of area.<n>

I looked out the window where I was sitting on the passenger side and saw three, blue, circular lights hovering over a field.  They were off in a distance of about 1500ft., were in a triangle formation at first and then started moving in a fast, jerky motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shouted to my husband to look quick.  These lights separated and spread out still hovering above the field as we kept driving.  My husband slowed the car and we both watched these objects for another minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what I was seeing I asked my husband, who was in the National Guard at the time, if the military had new flares they might be testing.

6/1/91 23:30|Flint|MI|Disk||UFO over Flint, Michigan 1991|1/22/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34543.html|30|ndxe199106| UFO over Flint, Michigan 1991<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time is pretty close, I think... but the date is just a guess. I shared an upstairs bedroom with my brother Sam. To better understand the stoty I have to describe the bedroom. It was the entire 2nd floor. About 12&#39;x24&#39; with windows at either end lengthwise, 2 in the main &#34;room&#34; and one at the end withthe stiarcase. My brother and I were staying up late one summer night watching tv, playing video games etc. in our room. I remember that a box fan was running in the lone window near the stairs to cool the room down, so that may account for the humming noise I remember but I&#39;m pretty sure the ufo we saw was humming. Anyway we were up late and fianally going to bed. Our beds we on either side of the double windows. As I was falling asleep I noticed colored lights outside. I got up and looked outside the open windows and saw what I thought was a helicopter hovering about 10 feet above and between our house and the next door neighbors. I woke up my brother and told him to check out this cool helicopter because we were both really into anything that flew. As we watched this thing I realized right away that it was not a chopper because there was no rotor wind and it wasn&#39;t making noise except for the humming (could&#39;ve been the fan). Then I started to get a feel for the size of this thing. It looked as though it was only 10-15 feet above the house but it covered an area at least 30&#39; in diameter maybe more. I also noticed two rings of lights on the craft. The inner circle of lights were a very dim white or yellowish color, and the outer ring had different colors that seemed to shift in sequence. The lights were very dim all over the craft. We watched it for nearly a 1min. before I noticed Chris our neighbor, looking out his window at the ufo. Right then the craft took off. Slowly at first it turned about 180 degrees and then it was gone. I&#39;ve told a few of my friends about this and have been laughed at. I figured that I was nuts. But two Christmas&#39;s ago, my brother brought it up after dinner. I! was in shock! But he remembers it the same. Has anyone else reported ufo&#39;s in the Flint area?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We slowly drove under it.  After we passed by we were still watching it from the car when it seemed to implode into an orange ball and shot straight up, very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I have an older son who also played numerous games at the same rink.  I traveled the road hundreds of times.  The road is steep enough so that you literally have a perfect look at the sky.  I remember it was a clear evening , almost dark.  So i could see the sky perfectly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thats when i saw that the stars were disappearing.  I saw a huge Black triangle shape with different color lights on the bottom.  I estimated it at over 1000 feet long ,I stopped the car , got my son out of the car, before I told him what I saw.   And asked him what He saw.  Exactly the same answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What blew me away was , it did not make a sound.  It moved WNW what I figured was about 40 - 50 MPH.  He even told me the different colors of light.  I know what I saw because I asked my son and he saw what i saw.  I said nothing to him except asked him exactly what he saw.  His last question to me was, what was that dad .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

About 1 to 2 miles over desert South of highway 160 we were traveling southwest bound on towards Flagstaff. Hovering but not moving about 500 - 1000 feet above the base of a small mountain range. After about 10 seconds of hovering stationary above mountain range, object then moved down the slope of the mountain range a bit, still hovering until it was about 200 feet off the ground (very close to the ground), North/Northeast bound off the base of the range at this point. Object slowly accelerated northeast-bound for a few seconds guesstimating between 50 and 100 mph, still about 200 feet above the ground, afterwards it then shot at a tremendous speed northbound, so fast I could just see it dart outside of my peripherial vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t realize what I was looking at until it moved from it&#39;s stationary position above the mountain, at which point I was a bit in shock when I saw the object fly downwards then hover along the ground moving. When it was moving northeast about 50 - 100 mph is when I think I realized what I was looking, and yelled in our car &#34;Hey do you see that?!&#34;. My family members lazily asked me &#34;See what?&#34;. By that time it was gone and to this day irritated that no-one else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no lights on the object, I heard no sound (being inside the car I didn&#39;t really expect too).

It could have been an expiremental military aircraft for I&#39;ll I know, but I have never seen anything manuvere they way that thing did.

Orange yellow glow emitted from this triangular UFO. We both pointed just like the movies and realized that we needed someone else to witness this. We ran 2 blocks down to another friends house. By the time we reached the corner of the other friends block the object was no where to be seen. After looking at the sky for a few seconds i managed to see the object.

The strange thing is that it was acending very slow and straight up not at an angle like the shuttle does and as sure as I said that to my friend the light shot straigt up what looked to be at least 3 miles up in the blink of an eye I mean rediculously fast.Before I knew it the thing started coming our direction I had to be at least 5 miles away and was over the lake we were at within 2 to 3 seconds and when we saw it hover over the lake the whole sky reflected off of it ,it was about the size of a vw bettle and there were two lights on top long ones moving back and forth. It was very quiet no sound but the crickets and frogs man, dont know what it was but my bud s! tarted shaking and upon trying to start his car I asked him not to beacause I wanted to know if what we were seeing was real. Had him decribe what he was seeing and it was exactly what I was seeing so I know it was real.  I stepped out of the car and proceeded to walk toward the lake edge to get a closer look at it hovering( 50ft or so in air) as I opened the car door and stepped out it straighted it self out went side to side across whole lake which was at leat half mile wide, zig zagged about 7 time and shot straight toward palm beach county in the blink of an eye. Never believed in UFOs but have  since.  Saw it a week later after everyone said I was crazy. Standing out back my house was the second and last encounter. Looked over toward the lake ,( by this time my girl had already said she had enough and she didnt know if she believed me. About ten min later looking toward  the lake we both noticed a bright light which appeared to be a spot light on a small plane. Almost out! of my mind at this time because I thought I was going crazy f! or what me and my friend saw just days before. Anyway looked like a spot light on a small plane started to get brighter and brighter so I took my lighter and started flickering it just because I guess , but as I did it me and my girl noticed the spot light start to flicker as I did with my lighter. Kinda creepy my girl started to wonder at this time because the more I flickered my light the more the spot light did the same as it came our direction over the pine trees. As it got closer we heard what sounded like a prop plane single engine. At this time my girl pretty much called me crazy and said ,&#34;see it&#39;s just a plane man i agreed and said your right. All of a sudden the plane noise changed to a helicopter sound. My girl started to weird out about this time and wanted to go inside.I told her hell no please stay i said everyone thinks I crazy. She agreed and at this time the noise coming toward us change into distinctly what sounded like a jet engine noise,but the light coming towar! d us was moving slowly. Until right about 5 seconds later there it was no sound just quiet. No more plane sound no more helicopter sound no more jet sound just hovering over a 40ft pine in my back yard. It sat at an angle with this weird  feeling we were being watched. My girl started crying and I asked her what do you see? Her reply,&#34; I see it I beleive&#34;, and continued to cry. I told her to go in the house and get my mom and her husband and to quietly walk out the back door to see. She headed toward the house while I just looked in awe. I heard them come around the front of house instead of the back ,looked over to tell them to hurry, looked back up and saw it fade out of view in front of me and a little flickering light appeared and began moving so fast and in ways no plane we have could have moved with such precission and no sound. Unfortunately my mother and her husband did not see it as we did. I was still called a lier even after my girl told them what she had seen. N! ote we were not believers until these events occured. As for m! y friend he was the smart one he never told anyone and said he wouldnt.. We have not spoken since the incident nor have I ever seen it again.I know this is very old sighting but please tell me I am not crazy or else how could I remember it as if it were right in front of me now. This happened when I was sixteen and am now 36 . I know I saw something i could not explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/1/91 04:00|Port Vue|PA|Sphere|10 minutes|Mother and daughter view glowing red sphere at 4:00 in an empty field 200 yards behind neighbor's back yard.|2/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11835.html|47|ndxe199106| Mother and daughter view glowing red sphere at 4:00 in an empty field 200 yards behind neighbor&#39;s back yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had fallen asleep on the living room couch.  I woke up at 4 am, I remember the time because I always look at a clock first thing to see if it&#39;s time for work.  Anyway, the room was glowing red and I noticed my mother staring out the window that was above the couch I was lying on.  We both saw the glowing red sphere that had landed in an empty field about 200 yards behind our next door neighbor&#39;s backyard.  The object was motionless and made no sound.  I don&#39;t remember what happened after the ten minutes, I think I fell back asleep leaving my mother to watch the object alone.  The next morning I checked the area for landing gear or burn marks but found nothing.  Note:  The empty field is now a new neighborhood that has been built over the last seven years.  Thank you  Would have reported this earlier had I thought anyone would believe the story but computers add so much anonimity, don&#39;t they?<n>
6/1/91 02:00|Yuma|AZ|Disk|7 hours/uncertain|Loss of hours while driving to Yuma, Az|6/18/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29220.html|48|ndxe199106| Loss of hours while driving to Yuma, Az<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time and date are not specific, as it was when I was about 18. i am now 30. A friend and I were driving, I was the passenger, to Yuma, Az. At about 2:00 a.m., I estimate we were about 15 minutes from Yuma. We saw in the desert about half a mile away a UFO with changing colored lights, the changed so frequently, maybe going around the craft, I cant be specific of all the colors. We pulled over to watch it for about 3-5 minutes and started to take off and we were watching it as we drove off very scared trying not to panic.  The next thing i recall is we are driving in the exact same place, but it is now about 8-9 a.m. I know we were in the same place because city lights were visable at night as the same in a.m. I remember being in a very calm state and not even talking about what we had seen, just very calm and relaxed. I cannot account for the hours in between.  I have no recall of any events of being abducted, but have no explaination for the loss of hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
