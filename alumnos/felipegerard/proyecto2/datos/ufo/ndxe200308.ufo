PD))|9/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31892.html|1|ndxe200308| Triangle of white lights heading north at high altitude over Portland<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mulino is approx. halfway between Salem and Portland, about 15 miles east of I-5, my brother in law and I standing in front of my house when he says what the hell is that. I look and we see a triangle of lights. These were single lights matching adjascent stars light output moving slowly north by northeast. Being in a heavily wooded area they were only visible for about a minute before being obscured by the trees. No sound, appeared to be very high altitude. Seen dozens of satilites but never three so close and moving in same direction. They also were blocking out local stars light when going between earth and stars so must have something solid between the points of light of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed the three satellites, which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy &#34;NOSS&#34; satellite surveillance system.  PD))<n>

My husband had an odd look on his face.  I asked him what was wrong?  He pointed to the clear sky and we looked up and then walked off the porch onto the street to see up in the sky something that looked liked a hot air balloon but it was all lit up and moved much quicker than a hot air balloon.  On the bottom of the &#34;hot balloon image&#34;  was a blinking light.  We watched for awhile and tried to determine what it was. . .we couldn&#39;t figured it out. . .because it moved to quickly to be a hot air balloon and not the shape of a blimp and moved much too quickly for it to be one.  Was not the moon because there was a blinking light on the bottom of this aircraft. . .I said it must be an UFO. . .they laughed. . .I said, &#34;Well it is an unidentified flying object. . .none of us can tell what it is!&#34;  Could this be some kind of alien aircraft?<n>

It appeared twice. The first time it apeared it was not along there were two red lights in the sky. The sky was clear. no clouds, no glare, no nothing around it. at this time my girlfriends sister called us in the car and we looked up in through the moon roof and there it was two bright red dots in the sky. when we got to there house it was gone. I looked up at the sky and saw two stars in the sky. I assumed that it could have been some sort of solar flare reflecting off the stars. then about 2 hours later it came back. this time only one bright red light appeared. and this time i had my video camera and recorded it all on tape. the light just stayed sationary it didn&#39;t move. then after a few mins the started to blink almost like morose code. then it dissapeared. after we recorded it we viewed it in slow motion. what was really strange was that at one point towards the end we saw a stream of light moving upwards from the ground up into the sky. how weird is that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once i figure out how to download the video to my computer i will send it in. sorry i&#39;m new to this and i just got my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We watched it move at a steady speed in a straight path across the sky,<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw a large fireball in the sky below a ceiling of clouds.  We were in a campground in the hills of Dansville.  At first we thought it was the fire from a hot air balloon as there was a Balloon festival that weekend.  However, the ball of fire was much larger than a balloons would be at the close distance, it was moving much faster than a balloon but not fast enough to be an aircraft; that was also a consideration beacuse there is also a small airport in the area.  We watched it move at a steady speed in a straight path across the sky, right to left,(Mars being on the right)and then it looked like it shrunk and dissapeared. We took 2 or three pictures on a disposable camera but as of yet have not had it developed.  I figure it won&#39;t look like much.  The next morning I called that area airport to make sure that any aircraft in the air at night should have the blinking lights (which he said yes) and to see if hot air balloons were allowed up at night (which he said no).  I then asked him if he had any reports of anyone seeing anything in the sky last night (which he said no).  When I hung up I heard the news on TV that there were many sightings in Calafornia that same night three hours after our sighting.  I am a night sky watcher and have never seen anything like it. Please contact me if your interested in a detailed description of our location or the pictures<n>
8/31/03 22:30|Madison|WI|Light|10 Sec.|Bright light flying at a low level and high rate of speed - much faster than any aircraft and too low to be a conventional space craft.|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31177.html|6|ndxe200308| Bright light flying at a low level and high rate of speed - much faster than any aircraft and too low to be a conventional space craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were driving from Sun Prairie to Madison at 10:30 pm on 8/31/03, just north of the airport.  My wife was sleeping at the time.  I saw a bright light screeming across the sky, from southwest to northeast, at a fairly low level (approximately 10,000-15,000 foot range).  It was traveling much faster than any jet plane, and my first thought was meteorite - but it was flying horizontal, not in a downward direction, and there was no trail behide it.  It was also flying much faster than any craft that would have been flying in or out of the airport - and at a direction not in line with any runways.  There was one airplane coming into the airport from the oposite (south) side of the city, and the pilot may have seen what I saw, although he/she was likely preoccupied in preparation for landing.  I only saw it for a few seconds as it was moving so fast.  When we arrived at home, I told my wife about it.  The next day, she heard part of a brief report on either CNN or Headline News about a light in the sky seen somewhere - but didn&#39;t catch any details.  Wondering if there is any more info. about the other report(s) - where else this was seen - etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw the one very bright star in the west it seemed to very akward because it looked to be moving and changeing colors,  We watched it move across the sky and get very bright and change colors to red and white yellow and green.  My two boys saw it shoot somthing down and appear to dreg a smaller light, I could not see this but my girlfreind could.  I was probally the same light that the lady in L.A could see on the same night as reported by CNN.,.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It after about 10 minutes got dim and then stayed in one spot. What we were looking at was not a star. When we watche the video on the t.v  I zoomed in on the light 600x,s and of course it got blury with digital pixels but the lights were clearly visable and the shape was sorta like a hexagon.  It was very far away and probaly over in L.A it was moving a lot but this far away it only seemed to be a short distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought that it was a low-flying aircraft nav light, but as it approached - quite rapidly in an arc flight path below a moderate cloud cover - it became evident that it was no aircraft.  No navigation lights, no strobe lights, no green starboard light.  We turned off the music system and the jacuzzi pump to listen for any engine noises.  There were none.  We live in a rural area where there is very little noise at night - no traffic noise at all at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached, the red light took on a ball shape with a steady, bright white light emitted, along with the red light.  We watched it disappear beyond our house roof in a NE&#39;ly direction, always maintaining a steady, rapid flight, covering the arc of about 100 degrees in an estimated 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired oil executive and my wife who also saw the entire event is a business administrator.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/31/03 21:02|La Canada|CA|Other|5 - 10 sec.|At first I thought this was a helicopter, and it may well have been, but the lights were odd, and didn't quite fit for a helicopter.|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31085.html|12|ndxe200308| At first I thought this was a helicopter, and it may well have been, but the lights were odd, and didn&#39;t quite fit for a helicopter.   There were three lights, all the same color: white, a little on the warm side, like tungsten.  They were close together, almost touching. It wasn&#39;t completely dark and I could not see a structure connecting or connected to the lights against the background sky.  I was answering my cell phone, and thus a little distracted during the sighting.  I initially thought the largest light was a bright interior light of the helicopter cabin, followed by a slightly smaller light on the rear rotor, topped by the third navigation light, a point source blinking at about 1 or 2 Hz.  After observing it for a second or two, it hit me that the pattern of lights didn&#39;t match a helicopter. I didn&#39;t hear a sound coming from it, which occurred to me after the event.  There also is a fair amount of freeway noise coming from the direction of the sighting, which may have been drowning out the motor if it were a helicopter.  This object was traveling east to west.  I viewed it directly from the north (ie., I was looking south).  It seemed to be coming from the Rose Bowl area and it headed off through Cresenta Valley going toward Sunland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have logged many hours in small aircraft, including helicopters, and can identify many aircraft by make.  I actively search the sky for UFOs.  This is the third strange light I&#39;ve seen.  I&#39;d like to hear from anyone who may have seen this as well, or who can confirm it was simply a helicopter.  The time is pretty exact, taken from the cell phone call.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 2100 we were star gazing with my binoculars. The conditions were perfect, no moon and very dark cloudless skies. The Milky Way was overhead and very bright and distint. My wife put down the binoculars and and was pointing out an airplane in the distance. I looked up..so we were both now looking in the same part of the sky and at that instant an object flew by about 1000&#39;(?) overhead from north to south. It was traveling very fast and was completely silent. The object was very dark, the only reason you could see it was that it blocked the stars as it went. the size was hard to judge. There were no lights on it but there was a faint glint like star light reflecting off of metal. It was gone in just a few seconds. We talked about it and we both described the same object. I camp alot and enjoy star gazing. I am very familiar with meteors, Iridium flares, sattelites and normal atmospheric phenomena. I have seen other things in the past but was always able to explain then away ( I thought ). This is one I can&#39;t explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a shiney object in the smoke almost directly above me it would appear then disappear in the thick blowing smoke, a couple of times I was able to see the entire bottom of the craft it was shaped like a teardrop all along the edge it looked like diamond cuts like you would see on jewelry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At times I thought it had left but the smoke would clear alittle and there it would be again.  It stayed in the clouds of smoke as long as the fireworks continued.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it was gone, not a sound did it make at least nothing I could hear over the fireworks. I seen no lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>

She said it was hovering ~ I said, no way..and laffed.  As I began to enter the bend in the road prior to the highway, it was directly over top of us.  There were four lights, with the two on the outsides being slightly the largest.  I could not see a shape  of the object, per say, because the lights were so bright and it was so close.  I told her I was stopping the van when I got out of the curve, right at the highway intersection.  By this time, it was obvious that the object was in fact hovering, b/c i had to look &#39;behind me&#39;, thru the back van window and also in the driver&#39;s side window to see it.  It was still up there.  I said, &#34;Let&#39;s get out&#34;.  As I unlocked the doors, I was watching it out of the corner of my eye (I had my head turned slightly left looking out the back side window at it.  We both jumped out of the van.  The very second I turned, it was absolutely and completely GONE.  (This thing was SO CLOSE to the ground, that the lights were almost blinding to look into.  I would have compared the lights on it to vehicle lights, maybe 4 car lengths ahead coming toward us.  It was, however, considerably wider). We literally jumped back into the van, and went into town (it was 8:40 when we arrived at the store, b/c the lady told us she got off at 9PM, in 20 minutes).  We got our few groceries, came back, &lt;still saying NO WAY&gt;, and returned home not seeing it (about 7 min from the store.)  Maybe because of my work background, I told her let&#39;s not discuss what it looked like, lets both go home and draw it.  We did.  It was the same thing.  I still have the drawings.  It was UNreal.  She and my husband and I went back out about 15-20 min later and reinacted it as closely as possible.  I turned on all lights in the van, at the area &#39;it&#39; was seen inust to prove to myself that it was not reflection! from inside the van.  She lit a cigarette, that wasn&#39;t the 4 lights.  Nothing made those lights appear again.  This was a craft of some type.  I could just &#39;sense&#39; it was hovering (well, how else could it be suspended in the sky so close to the ground unless it was in fact a craft, hovering?????)  We are still &#39;anxious&#39;, for lack of better word, still not believing that we saw this odd looking thing.   Both of us continue to say, &#34;This can NOT be for real!&#34;  But it is.  It was.  We both saw it.  **Note**  WE heard NO sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like how a planet would look when they are at their closest.  It stood out significantly from the other visible stars.  A few seconds later, a halo appeared as it took off.  It went out of sight within a few seconds.  It flew straight up North about 45 degrees.  I went back inside to tell my wife.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He and his fiancée were on their way home, which is in the Thronhill area of Terrace when they spotted a strange object hovering high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The couple were driving along Crumb Road and looked up just over the trees and high up underneath the clouds they saw the object. He described it as being rather flat, dark gray in color and it sat stationary for approx: one minute before it disappeared. They both saw a number of lights on it, the fellow said he thought there were 5 lights, and his fiancée thought there were 6. All the lights were white in color and the witness said they looked like the headlights on a vehicle. The witness believe the lights were running around the object but was hard to say for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His fiancée thought at first it may have been a plane, but they soon ruled that out because it sat in the same position for such a long time. &#34;It did not move&#34;. After I asked a number of questions, the witnesses said the object would have been shaped more like a disk in shape. It was rather long, but not a lot of height to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked the witness if he might give me some kind of idea of the size of the craft. As we know this is not an easy thing to do. The man turned to his fiancée and asked, both said they thought it may have been around one and a half thumbs wide. This was a guess at how long this object may have been. No sound was heard, mainly because the couple were in their vehicle and they may have not heard anything due to the altitude the craft was at. They also reported that the sun was not shinning off it, in other words no reflection off the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The couple said after the object disappeared they drove to the airport just to have a look to see if any planes were around the area, he told me there was nothing in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

When they soon left I saw a round light moving slowly but not following the copters. It look like the sun but smaller, maybe the size of an airplane and I couldn&#39;t tell the distance it was.  It was a hazy color so anyone could look directly at it. I couldn&#39;t make out what it was. It wasn&#39;t a plane or not even a weather balloon. But I have a feeling the military was there keeping an eye on it. I didn&#39;t hear anything on the news or paper about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It must have been a few streets over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened so quick but I remember this:  It looked as if it came up from the ground, on the left side of the trees, and went down to the right side.  Like up,over and down. I thought wow, what was that?  As I was thinking that exact thought, It happened again, in the same spot it started out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do remember a small round blinking light, but I&#39;m not sure if it was in the center.

I thought it was a helicopter at first, since it was pretty stationary and the lights were bright.  The lights we&#39;re not blinking.  The weird thing that happened was that this object swooped down in front of the SUV in front of me and the SUV broke hard.  I&#39;ve never seen an aircraft move that fast and change directions so quickly.  I woke up my wife immediately and told her that I thought I just saw a UFO.  I looked to the east to see if there was a neighboring airport in the vicnity and there was nothing out there.  I looked in my rear view mirror and saw the lights move upwards erratically zig-zagging throught the sky.  I knew for sure that was no ordinary aircraft.  Nothing to my knowledge, could move that fast and change directions so quickly.  I was hoping to catch the SUV at a gas station to ask him what he saw because it looked like he got a better view of it than I did, since he had to brake in order on to collide with it.  Before this event, I never believed in these types of things but now I&#39;m a true believer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It came from outside my bedroom window which overlooks the driveway; the window was open.  It lasted for just a couple of seconds once I awoke and seemed to fade out but at the same time a long drawn out buzzing started.  It was more similar to a musical note than a mechanical buzzing - the buzzing tone you hear from a tuning fork as it rings in your ears.  It was moving around outside and I thought perhaps a street sweeper was out there but there were no other noises, just the buzzing hum.  No engines, no radio, nothing else.  My dog was under the covers shivering which is very unlike her.  She is a terrier and usually has no fear; just growls or barks at all night noises.  I got up to look out the window but saw nothing on the ground or in the sky.  I still heard the odd humming noise that was moving around in the distance.  It would fade out and become louder.  It stopped for a couple of minutes and then started again and finally quit altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I told my parents about it the next morning, my mother (a no-nonsense midwesterner) said she had seen some odd lights that night.  It was about midnight and she couldn&#39;t sleep so she went into the darkened living room.  She looked out the window which faces north and saw some lights in the far distance in the Northeast that were just over the horizon.  She went to get a glass of water and came back and they had not moved.  As she watched the lights, they moved a slight bit to the east and then back.  They moved very slowly and she thought she saw red &amp; green lights like the landing gear of a plane but when she got the binoculars, she noticed more colors of lights.  The object seemed to be moving farther away but very slowly.  She watched the object for about 10-15minutes before it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First I saw a bright red light, nearly overhead, but more to the north.   I watched it for 10 minutes, it tracked a little to the north-west, began blinking and dissapeared.   About a half hour later, I saw the same bright red light to the east or south east.   It was lower in the horizon, moved very slowly in a north-westerly direction, hovered for a while, blinked intermittantly and the lights went out. I video taped it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe in UFO&#39;s.  This could easily have been a man made object - it was just very strange for a number of reasons:  The bright red light, It hovered in the same place and made no noise, the blinking of the light seemed random.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly, this long rod (about 10ft in length) came down. I can&#39;t remember exactly, but it had 3 bright white balls of light on it. It was about 30 ft from my window, hovering about 100 ft in the air. It quickly swayed back and forth, then took off out of nowhere. It just disappeared. The balls of light were so bright that they hurt my eyes. I quickly ran to the window to look for further evidence, but nothing was found. After a few minutes I went online again to see if my friends had seen anything, and one of them had seen something similar at the same time as me. He told me it was something bright.. which looked like a star going straight downwards across his house. We don&#39;t think these two occurences were linked but they did happen at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report from student.  PD))<n>

The fellows wife was driving and he was in the passengers seat. As they drove along they suddenly were enveloped in a very high intense white light. The witnesses reported that the light was coming from behind them. The husband first thought it might have been a O.P.P. cruiser with their spot lights on. But they soon realized that it was something very unusual due to the light growing in size around there vehicle and the surrounding area. Also the couple mentioned it all took place very quickly, in approximately five seconds went by before the event was over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness said the light was so intense that it lit up the whole hemisphere. They said from their location on the highway they had a beautiful view of the area and the whole sky was lit up. His wife who was driving looked into the outside rear mirror and observed an object coming up from behind them with three colored lights on it. (In the sky)  His wife reports that the lights were orange, red and green in color. Also they added that the white light which engulfed their vehicle was so bright that they had a very hard time seeing where they were going. Also their were a number of cars on the highway at the time and everyone hit their brakes as the witnesses noted all of the car&#39;s brake lights came on. The fellow said their had to have been some 10 or 12 vehicles on the road at this time due to the long weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as his wife glanced into the mirror and saw the three lights behind their car, there was an explosion of this bright intense light and then it disappeared. All the light was gone, and not a sound was heard throughout this whole event. They did mention to me that the vehicle&#39;s windows were rolled up and they were listening to music.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the couple arrived home and started thinking about what just took place, they wondered if an aircraft had exploded as they were trying to make some sense of what they witnessed. He told me it was a clear night so know lightening was around. The fellow said they saw some neighbors sitting outside, so he went over and asked, did any of you see that bright light? All of the neighbors said yes, and commented what the heck was it. Others who were camping around the area also witnessed it. Pilots who were on the ground at the time, saw it. Also the T.V. and radio stations were reporting it as well and a number of area residents had called in reporting they saw this very bright light which lit up the whole sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway gang, there is a lot more to come of this sighting. This is just the first of a few reports I will be making on this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

The light had a slight green glow to it and I thought it was a car coming up the road with strange headlights until I turned around and noticed an orange/green ball of light above our heads.  As soon as we looked at it, it exploded directly above the trees beside us, when it exploded it was like a firework exploding in all directions with orange balls of fire.  I did hear a sound that is hard to explain, I believe what we saw was a bolide.

There were about 25-30 people who all witnessed this event and also others that were staying at the lake. It seemed to have caught the attention of all that were outside. suddenly high in the sky a bright blue ball of light came streaking across the sky. It turned from blue to orange then green and left a trail of light like something burning in the sky. the trail of light seemed to have lasted for about ten to fifteen minutes. None of us of all ages have ever seen anything like it and left us all wondering what the heck it was. We all thought maybe a satelite burning up in the atmosphere. we all thought for sure we would hear something 0n the news or papers but nobody has heard anything as to what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness states that event occurred on Sunday morning, August 31, at between midnight and 01:00 hrs.<n>

It was very, very high  in the sky and it was obviously not an aircraft. At first we thought it was Mars, but we later located Mars at a different location from the glowing red object.  It was stationary for almost the entire duration while we were watching it, and then it started moving northerly and then disappeared all of a sudden. It did not leave any trails in the sky but faded in and out a couple of times before disappearing.  It was extremely bright and very red. We are absolutely positive it was not an aircraft due to the apparent extreme altitude, shape, and movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/30/03 23:59|McGregor|MN|Chevron|5 minutes|Huge, stealth like craft passses over us with red and white lights, only to be followed by squadrons of fighters in its path|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31156.html|35|ndxe200308| Huge, stealth like craft passses over us with red and white lights, only to be followed by squadrons of fighters in its path<n> <n><n> <n><n> Craft sounded like a slow flying jet. We could hear it coming before we saw it. It was around midnight so it was dark and all you could see was the lights. There were four white lights on the rear of the craft in the shape of a diamond and two red lights on each wing, Maybe one on the end of the wing and one in the middle of the wings. None of the lights were blinking like all the other aircraft in the sky today. The lights on the wings were angled back so you could tell that the wings were swepted back like a jet. It reminded me of a Stealth only in a much much larger scale. At first I thought it was more than one plane flying in formation but the lights would&#39;nt have made any sense, because there would have been only one plane with the four white lights on the back of it and four other planes flying with only one red light. So it came to our conclusion that it could only be one plane. Antway it continued across the lake and at that point we could see two other planes coming across the sky at a very fast rate of speed to meet up with it and fly almost like escorting it till it was out of our sight. About twenty minutes later a squadron of planes flew over us in the same exact spot and the same direction almost like they were trying to duplicate what the other had just done. Only the precision flying wasn&#39;t there, and the lights were blinking on these planes. They had red and white lights on them too. Only each plane had red and white lights on them. After a while another squadron of them flew the same way and a little while another squadron. All of these planes had both red and white lights blinking on them. Thats why I think that the first one we saw was one big craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking up at sky and there it was a bright red object just hovering what seemed to be right next to mars. It was moving very slowly east to west then up and down sort scanning the area. This was very exciting so I called the local news station Fox 11 news and I got a hold of somebody at the breaking news desk. Well I told her I wanted to report something going on in the sky and before I could tell her anything she said to me &#34;Is this about the red glowing object in the sky?&#34; Apparently my friends and I were not the only ones seeing this. We continued to observe the object as it sort of cruised the sky and then it started to dim as if fading away, then it got bright red again. Then it started heading north were it stopped and then just disappeared, faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was on my balcony, facing south, looking up at the clouds, watching the searchlights.  I could see what I believe is Mars just above the tops of the clouds.  I noticed a pair of red lights (they could have been just about any color, I am color-blind) moving quickly across the underside of the clouds in a west-to-east direction, towards Sandia Mountain.  I first thought that it was someone with a powerful laser pointer having some fun - the lights moved in a jerky manner, as a light directed from the ground might, but I have tried to shine a laser pointer on the underside of a cloud at night before, and I realize that they are not powerful enough to do this at such a distance.  In any case, I was startled when the lights came to the edge of the cloud formation and did not disappear, as they would have if they were merely lights being shone on the bottom of the cloud by people below on the ground.  The lights instead continued on and quickly vanished over the top of Sandia Mountain.  I waited to see if the lights would return, but they did not.  I turned around and noticed my kitchen clock - it was nearly midnight, so I would put the time of my observation at around 11:55 P.M. Mountain Time.  It was only after the lights vanished that I realized that they had moved without making a sound.  With the low-hanging clouds tonight, if it had been military or civilian jets, they should have made a noise I could hear.  Also, I believe that jets have blinking lights - these were on steady and bright.  Also, jets tend to move in a straight line - these lights jerked back and forth, not a lot, but far more than a jet could do.  I have never made any kind of a report before, and this may mean nothing, but it was interesting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The craft&#39;s &#39;wingspread&#39; was an apparent two inches at arm&#39;s length.  It had four white lights in a diamond shape at the front, an apparent one quarter inch in size at arm&#39;s length, and two solid red lights on each of the apparent leading edges.  None of the lights blinked and all were very bright.  We heard the craft coming over the trees at the water&#39;s edge before we saw it, so it was apparently flying very slowly.  All were in awe upon seeing it, as it was flying much too slowly to be a &#39;standard&#39; aircraft, the lights were very bright and distinct, and yet it was apparently high the sky.  The sound it made was that of a very high flying commercial jet.  It was flying west to east, directly toward Duluth, Mn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Prior to seeing this craft, two of the witnesses had been watching two apparent military aircraft in the distance north of the lake, flying east.  After the craft passed overhead, these two military craft were seen flying very fast southeast to intercept the unindentified craft.  No sound was heard from the military craft, which suggests they were at high altitude, and one of the witnesses, formerly in the military, stated that they were flying above mach speed.  They covered ground VERY quickly.  They then intercepted the unidentified craft several miles away and then flew next to it, while two more military aircraft appeared from the south and also flanked the craft, as it disappeared into the distance.  All of the military craft were much smaller than the object, which dwarfed them.  From this, it was estimated that the size of the object was approximately one thousand feet from wing tip to wing tip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thirty minutes later, at 12:30am, several military craft were seen coming from the east, circled the area, and then joined with a group of aircraft following the exact path of the first object, and attempting to fly in the same triangular pattern, apparently in a attempt to show that the first object was only a military excercise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again at 1:34am, two more military aircraft circled the area, this time close enough that through a binoculars they could be identified as fighter jets (the lights on these aircraft made structure visible), and again they joined with a formation of other aircraft flying the exact path of the original object, and in a triagle formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All witnesses thought this situation had an element of high strangeness about it.  In one hour and thirty five minutes, twenty six aircraft were observed, including the original object.  It is believed that twenty five of the aircraft were &#39;normal&#39; military craft.  The witnesses have been in this area during the summer for many, many years, and have never seen this number of aircraft, either during the day or at night, and hardly ever have seen military aircraft of any kind flying overhead.  We are not on a normal commercial route and seldom see commercial craft overhead.  It could be that the first two military craft flew in from Minot Air Force base in Minot North Dakota, although this is only speculation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were able to video tape portions of the encounter, although we did not get the object on tape as it first went overhead, as we needed to send someone through the dark and into the cabin to retrieve the camera, thus the quality of the video is not very good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the first sighting of any kind for the vast majority of the witnesses.  I&#39;m the only person who has ever seen a UFO, having made a report to MUFON several years ago.  Only one of the witnesses had been drinking alcohol, and that only beer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/30/03 23:55|McGregor|MN|Other|5 mins.|Large V shaped aircfaft slowly flying overhead while other planes scramble to catch up.|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31179.html|39|ndxe200308| Large V shaped aircfaft slowly flying overhead while other planes scramble to catch up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft in question came out from behind the tree line above and out in front of us heading NNE.  If I was to hold my fingers out at arms length and about 2 1/2 inches apart, that would be about the size it appeared in the sky. The sound was a low rumble like you would hear from a jet liner going over, except that the sound was coming directly from the source, as opposed to trailing the aircraft, which makes me think that it wasn’t very high in the sky, but yet I would estimate it at between one and two miles. It turned to the east and continued on until it was out of sight. As far as the shape, I would say it was like a B2 bomber but would have had to have been bigger. A little before we saw this my brother and nephew had noticed a couple smaller aircraft flying around to the north of the lake. As the big one turned to head east, the two screamed across the sky and met up with it a ways out. We could not hear the smaller planes so they must have been pretty high up. On a normal night we may only see one to four planes on average, and knowing how slow they move across the sky I thought that the two planes must be jet fighters because they crossed the sky quickly. Within an hour later 2 smaller planes came back from the east and we watched them thinking that it may be the same two that had caught up and escorted the big one. They had made a couple of turns, which again made me think that they were not commercial planes ( again, what we normally see up there are commercial planes that fly high over head in a perfectly straight line.) Anyway then we heard planes overhead and saw four planes flying in &#34;V&#34; formation and trying to follow the same route as the big craft flew. The formation looked like they were trying to make it look like it was what we saw earlier, but was obviously not. After a while and seeing a few more planes jetting around the sky I went to bed, but was told that everyone that stayed up saw one more display of the &#34;V&#34; formation a little later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few key points to myself are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) We normally will only see one to three planes per night. We sit out at the campfire every weekend looking up at the stars and counting satellites, so it’s not like we don’t look up. On this night we saw in excess of 20 planes, all after 11:45 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) The big craft appeared to be flying too slowly for something that big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) The fighters that screamed across the sky to intercept or escort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of questions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) What was this large craft? 2) Would the airforce admit to flying &#34;training exercises&#34; or anything else? 3) Is it possible that this large craft was below radar and the other planes were waiting for it to show itself, and we saw it as it was going up and the two smaller craft streaked toward it when they picked it up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lastly I would like to mention one thing that may have nothing to do with this but may be worth mentioning. About an hour earlier than the sighting of the big craft, we heard loud commotion back in the woods maybe a mile or more that sounded like many coyote’s or wolves howling or fighting. This went on and off for about a half an hour or so and ended shortly before seeing the big craft. These sounds were coming directly in the area of where we saw the craft come from. Probably just a coincidence<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date of the sighting was August 30.  We have amended the data above.  PD))<n>

I immediately ran out to see what everybody was looking at. I looked up and saw this large slow moving craft that made a low rumbling sound, like a passenger jet at 30,000 feet. The craft had a flying wing appearance with 4 red lights on the trailing edges, 2 on each side spaced evenly across its wingspan. 4 white lights in a diamond pattern were focused near the center and were equally as bright. It was flying slow enough and/or low enough that the sound was not delayed but seemed to emanate directly from the craft. Holding my hand out above me, the craft was about 2 inches wide in the sky and was moving at a rate of 1 inch per every 2 seconds, and seemed to be accelerating. After about 30 seconds of watching it move in a straight line across the sky, 2 aircraft which appeared to be F15&#39;s were moving in on its location at very high velocity. Once both reached the craft one F15 followed off the crafts left wing, and another directly behind it. Both of these F15&#39;s had noticeable wing tip lights and a center flashing light, standard to military aircraft. In the distant we could still hear the low rumble of the craft yet no sound from screaming the F15&#39;s, which suggests they were too far away too hear, which would also imply the scale of this craft was enormous. After another minute or so, we could still see the flashing lights of the following F15’s in the distant, while another F15 flew overhead at very high velocity toward the craft in the distant. From then on we saw an occasional pair of F15’s which looked to be in a search pattern across the sky. Not more than a half hour later 4 military aircraft flew over head in a formation that looked similar to the craft that flew over, yet only a single white light in the center, one red light to the right, and 2 red lights way too far off to the left. All had flashing lights. They looked as though they were trying to “copy” the lights of the first craft. A! lthough, it was obvious these were F15’s or similar because they were traveling at much higher velocity and the delay of sound was very long. Within a time span of an hour, 2 more F15’s had circled around and met up with yet another formation of five F-15’s that closer matched the look of the first craft, yet even this time it was obvious again that these were more F15’s in a V-formation at high altitude, high velocity, and long delay of sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Second report from different witness.

At 11:30pm, 12:25am and 1:30am. There were six red lights in a wing pattern, but no tail lights, it was moving fairly slowly and looked quite large, I heard a definite engine sound, but did not sound like a typical jet aircraft. There is no airfield large enough to land such a large craft (I did not make out an actual shape or craft, just the lights, but they spanned a large area). The same (or different) lights, traveled over the same path on the 3 seperate times indicated above - I tried to take pictures the second time, I have not yet developed the film. The exact location was at the Mississippi River, at Riverton, MN (at the location of Rabbit lake). I did not call the hotline since it may have been planes (but it must have been a huge plane and I don&#39;t know where such a plane would land) and I don&#39;t know how to check with the local airports to see if it was in fact a plane (somebody would have been tracking it, I assume). We have been going to this piece of property for 3 years and I have never seen similar air traffic- which is why I thought I would report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

8/30/03 23:30|Maricopa|AZ|Unknown|2 hours|17 stationary and slow moving starlike objects emitting brilliant rainbow lights|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31069.html|44|ndxe200308| 17 stationary and slow moving starlike objects emitting brilliant rainbow lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Rainbow lights:  Observed what looked like 17 peculiar stars flickering more brightly than usual at irregular intervals.  Viewed through binoculars these objects were emitting brilliant flashing rainbow lights -- predominantly red, blue, green and gold. Other stars viewed through the binoculars did not take on this appearance.  The majority of these 17 objects remained stationary.  Most of them were in the southwestern quarter of the sky near or over the Barry Goldwater military range.  A few were observed in the northwest and northern quarters.  A few were observed in north-northeastern quarter.  A few were viewed in the southern quarter.  None were observed directly overhead and all at distances too great to discern shape of object.  I only saw the lights which were only visible with the binoculars, not the naked eye, so they appeared to be very far away.  Three were observed to be moving very gradually:  one in the north moved northwest to northeast in the direction of Phoenix.  Then a pair in the south moved closer to one another as did a pair in the northwest.  Several of them formed triangles at the points of the compass.  Two finally disappeared out of visual range or below the horizon.  At one point, one in the south changed from flashing rainbow colors to brilliant purple-blue light.  I did not observe any other unusual activity in the skies.  Some aircraft flew by during these hours, yet I was completely able to identify them as conventional aircraft due to the wing lights and rapid consistent movement.  None of the rainbow objects moved that fast.  Most of these objects were still hovering in the sky at the time I went inside to go to bed which was about 1:30 a.m.  My background is in the legal profession.  My partner witness has a background in semiconductor engineering.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was lemony with a bluish tinge in colour.  There was no sound.  We (2 middle-aged women) were part of a &#39;Citizens on Patrol&#39; group formed in the rural area, just north of Vernon to patrol our area for possible fires. Shifts last 2 hours. We had signed up for the 10-12 midnight shift.We live 45 minutes north of Kelowna in the interface between the city of Vernon and crown land.  We were near the north end of Hartnell Road, coming down the road when we saw a brilliant flash to the northeast, illuminating the mountain behind.  As suddenly as the flash appeared, it disappeared. The energy required to illuminate the mountain (East Vernon Hill) must have been enormous. Neither of us had seen anything like this before. As you can imagine, given the fire danger, we were anxious to find out if this event had fire potential. The sky was clear and cloudless so we discounted lightning...did not see another flash thereafter. Also, there was no sound accompanying the flash.  We wondered if it was part of a meteor shower but have no explanation for what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was 11:15 pm.  It was very large. About the size of a football field or larger. It was moving very slowly.  It made no sound.  It had three red lights on one side and two on the other. It had a cluster of white lights in the nose. With my binoculars I could tell that the cluster  was three white lights.  These three white lights toghter were about the same size as one red light.  These lights were not flashing like plane lights do. The one red light that was missing was bettween the two red lights on one side.  It glided off to the east, till I couldn&#39;t see it any more.  I seen it for about 3 minutes.  All the lights moved together as if it was one huge object.<n>

My wife hollered for me to come outside and look at the lights which I did.  I noticed at least 6 bright lights, 2 non-flashing white lights in front. and five red flashing lights in the back   flying to the East in a large V shaped formation, they weren&#39;t flying very high or fast and they gave off a low rumbling sound somewhat like a jet.  As the formation went over my house they suddenly broke their formation and were moving around.  The whole event was startling to witness.  One of my brothers was hollering at me to get my camera.  I told them it would not pick up the lights so there was no use trying to take a picture.  I called the Sheriffs Dept. at about 11:30 to see if any one else had reported these lights.  The dispatcher said no one else called anything in.  Then at 12:03 a.m. another formation of lights flew overhead just like the first formation, heading east and a little to the North.  We had all decided to stay outside to see what was going on at this point.  And then again another formation of lights just like the first formation flew over at about 1:15 a.m heading in the same Easterly direction.  I am assuming these were fighter jets going overhead but the first formation seemed a little odd, the lights in front of the formation didn&#39;t seem like aircraft lights.<n>

It began to move upwards in a northerly direction towards my location. As it got closer I could distinguish that the light was composed of three smaller lights in a triangular configuratiion. The light object hovered there for about five seconds then it became reduced in size at high speed and disappeared and reappeared a few times until finally disapearing for good. When it turned off and on it seemed to be breathed in and out of space. I ran in the house to turn off the oven, I looked outside again towards the southern sky and there it was again in the same location as the first sighting, to the right of Mars! It started moving upwards in the same direction as the first time. It seemed at a higher altitude than the first one. When it got almost overhead, it hovered for a few seconds before moving in a doodle like line for about a minute before moving farther in a northwest direction and doing similar movements. It then moved northbound and closer before completely disappearing into space again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After a minute or so I took notice of the stationary orbit of this object. I did&#39;nt think it was an airplane( or else it would&#39;ve flown on by now ) nor a helicopter. ( As I thought it was too far up for any helicopter to hover---that I&#39;m aware of.) I pointed this out to my friends and for the next half-hour or so we watched this red-lighted object slowly traveled west,northwest,north,and finally northeast before it suddenly vanished as though someone turned-off a light switch!  During its slow flight we observed this object through binoculars and we were able to see this object as a cluster of lights from a very faintly dark-colored almost-triangular shaped object. Some starlight was able to provide a slightly lighter background for us to make out this dark shape. Also during its flight, we noticed the red light dimmed at times as well as getting slightly brighter. Two other witnesses were called out and watched with curiousity and interest. We concluded this was an object we had not seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

8/30/03 22:35|Whittier|CA|Light|70 minutes?|Unblinking red light motionless for over one hour in the sky.|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31127.html|57|ndxe200308| Unblinking red light motionless for over one hour in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very red starlight object hovered motionless in the WNW sky. Not orange-red, not blood-red, just pure red. Approximate magnitude 2.0, 45 degrees above the horizon. I don&#39;t know if it was the same object, or perhaps a second object, one hour later it was five degrees to the south (still 45 degrees above the horizon. It never blinked or changed in any way. The pure red color drew the eye. I watched it for 20 minutes the first time. Since I was already outside with my telescope looking at Mars (which was in the opposite sky), I looked at this object through my telescope. I could discern no shape, or even source of the light (was not reflecting light they way lights on standard aircraft tend to do.) Therefore all I could see through the telescope was a &#34;very red star&#34; surrounded by darkness. When I looked at it an hour later, it had moved or another one had shown up, I only saw the one light. No flashing, blinking, or moving; one moment it was there, and suddenly it was gone. At first I thought it was a helicopter, looking through my telescope I realized it was not (I would have seen the shape.) Sky was clear overhead with some haze/fog along the horizon (well below the strange light.) This red light barely even twinkled, adding to the strangeness. I am baffled. This light didn&#39;t do anything at all. I just recognized it as a &#34;star&#34; that shouldn&#39;t be there, and a ruby red star at that. If I am to guess the altitude, I would say 30,000 feet? This did not seem to be a very high altitude object. I am a longtime amateur astronomer and and able to tell the differences between aircraft, helicopters, dirigibles, migrating birds, etc. If this was one of ours, it must be something new. The light did not do anything, it was hung in the sky, unblinking and unflashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports.  PD))<n>

I followed the light across the sky when another light seemed to intercept it and returned along the path of the last light.  I watched these lights do this for about a half an hour and quit when I noticed an aircraft in the vicinity and the lights vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Then the hole shape moved from 12 to 9 o´clock in a few seconds. The funny thins is that we noticed that for about 25 minutes the incomming air traffic was stopped as the evening before (and also according to the timetables) every 2 minutes an airplane should come in. Only two planes have been comming in on diffent flightpaths (different to te regular flightpaths we noticed on the evenings before. We saw this all from our hotelroom in Barcelona.

No sharp turns or flashing lights were noted. It looked like the moon in a total eclipse.  There was a  slight glow of white light eminating from around the circular edge. It was about 2/3&#39;s the size of the moon.  This particular night the moon was on the rise and in a slight crescent phase.  I called out to my husband what I was seeing at the time.

We went to the window &amp; I saw it for maybe 2 seconds.  We then ran outside at 9:45 p.m. to look at the sky above our street.  The object emerged from behind houses into full view and continued traveling from northeast toward the southwest.  It was a clear , dark night and the moon was a sliver in the south,behind us.  A few stars were visible.  The object made no sound and looked evenly lit up bright white.  It was oval in shape with the ends of the oval parallel to the horizon.  Around the whole perimeter were evenly spaced lights that glowed with a brighter blue-white light.  Standing on our sidewalk we observed this clearly for about 20 seconds.   I&#39;d estimate that it moved thru 40 degrees of arc until it was again hidden by trees/houses.  Both my husband &amp; I felt it was very large.  It was at least as large as 10 full moons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as height , it may have been between 600 -1200 feet  altitude.  It was at about 30 degrees  to the horizon ( NNE).  When I lost sight of it at home, I ran to get keys and started my car to go look for it. When I drove up the Shunpike Rd. toward Summit,N.J. and I was a a hilltop overpass of Route 78 ,I looked down Rt. 78 and saw this object over the road maybe around Berkley Heights, 4 miles away.  Since I could not park there, I continued driving to Springfield Ave., Berkeley Heights where I saw it for the last time now in the SW sky.  Our background is that we are both college grads and I have a M.S.  We both work as successful executives in business careers. In my youth I was in Civil Air Patrol and became a pilot.

I saw what looked like 4 soft white light glowing football shaped objects flying in a perfectly straight line, wing tip to wing tip. They did not make any noise. There were traveling from west to east heading out over the Atlantic Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t see them until they were directly overhead the beach. They appeared to be flying at about the same level as the lowest cloud tops. It was a mostly clear night, but a few puffy clouds were scattered about the sky. The moon was lighting up the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed them out to my wife and said, &#34;Look at those things flying in formation.&#34; She said, &#34;That&#39;s just a plane.&#34; Then I said, &#34;No. That&#39;s four separate objects flying in a line, wing tip to wing tip.&#34;  Then I watched as the left end object swung out wide from the formation and then shortly thereafter rejoined the formation exactly where it had been. The wing tips were exactly spaced between the objects and the speed was exactly the same for all of the objects. If those were airplanes I had never seen the bottom of airplanes glow in a soft white light and the shape was not an airplane shaped even a reflection off of an airplane would not look like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flying objects stayed in a perfect line formation, wing tip to wing tip and suddenly faded into the blackness of space a few seconds after the left wing object rejoined the formation. I will never forget it. I had never seen anything like it. I am 51 years old. My wife was 45 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget the soft white glow crossing the dark sky directly overhead. I didn&#39;t get scared or anything. There were lots of people out on the beach that night. But I don&#39;t know if anyone else looked up to see what we saw. In case it was a plane, I kept listening for an engine noise, but never heard a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to call the talk show last night and talk about this, but could not get through.

As I sat on a bench waiting on him, I was watching what I thought was Mars straight ahead in my view. It was a reddish-orange color and I watched it for approximately 10 minutes when suddenly it just disappeared. I never took my eyes off of it &amp; saw it just blink out.  Just then my friend came out &amp; I was telling him about it as we walked toward his car when I looked up and saw what seemed to be (judging by the color) the same object moving across the sky toward the moon. A few notes about this is: When I first saw it before it disappeared, it never blinked or moved at all until it disappeared. It appeared to be round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time I saw it, as it moved across the sky, it would blink off for about a second and a half and appear at a further distance and as it moved, it seemd to move in a sliding motion as it seemed to pause for about 2 seconds and then move some more. It was hard to distinguish the shape due to the blink. I lost sight of it after about six of these &#34;jumps&#34; from one spot to another in a straight line. Also, there were others outside so I&#39;m sure they saw it too<n>

No movement of leaves; No movement of cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note on Weather:  An article in the OTTAWA CITIZEN newspaper, on August 31 reported that the Hot Air Balloons from the Balloon Festival were forced down in the South End of the city at dusk due to insufficient wind to carry them to better landing sites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking past the Convention Centre when I noticed a movement and stopped to watch a bright sphere move in a South West direction. When first seen, I was at about 45 degrees above the horizon, or about the height of the National Defence building. It was directly over the Canal and curved down towards the trees between the Canal and the National Arts Centre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving at a very rapid pace, faster than city traffic, and was only seen briefly, 2;about a minute at most but probably about 15-30 seconds. There were tourists and other passers-by but it did not occur to me to point out the object to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a perfect sphere, very bright, probably from reflected light, as I watched it intently and it changed from bright to black. There was an intermediate quarter moon phase, so it was probably dark on one side and highly reflective on the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably not one of the hot-air balloons from the Hot Air Festival as it had no basket, was not the usual tear-drop or fanciful shape or colour, and would have distinctly varied in size if it was passing over or coming down near enough to me to be framed by the National Defence Building and the National Arts Centre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because it was perfectly spherical, opaque to light, showed no sign of colour and changed from bright to dark, I eliminated the possibility of a toy balloon on the spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a point of trying to determine if it was one of those round pillow shaped greeting balloons which have a printed sight and a shiny metal side but it did not appear to change shape at all. If it was a balloon of that size (one foot, 30 centimetres diameter)  it was closer to me on the ground than either the National Arts Centre or the National Defence building when I observed it, so a change in shape should have been visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, I considered the possibility that it might be a helicopter or a large balloon (in the range,  two to six foot diameter, one to two metres). It was difficult to determine scale as it was against a background of clear sky. The curve in its flight suggests that it was distant enough to appear to move along the curvature of the sky, but in that case it must have been bigger than a house. I don&#39;t recall seeing it actually pass behind the trees, so I may have been momentarily distracted at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I revisited the site to attempt to determine where I was standing while I stopped and watched the balloon. I remembered that the canal was directly before me the day before but acquired no new information on my exact position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did notice a couple of large advertising balloons attached to the stroller/perambulator of a child in the Rideau Centre Shopping Mall. They were advertising a story called Richards or something like (it definitely started with an &#34;R.&#34; They were about 1.5 feet or 50 centimetres in diameter, transparent and green. It is unlikely that a metallic, two-coloured balloon was being used as a promotional giveaway as well, but they were within the possible size-range of the object which I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to call this object a U.F.O. because the only evidence that it was a balloon was its shape and change of brightness, while the total absence of wind on the ground or at cloud level does not permit me to suppose that it was moving under wind power. Also, its path seemed curved with the curvature of the sky and if it was a wind it was taking a highly anomalous downward curve path.  Do high speed air currents curve to the ground?  I did, however, have the impression that the sphere was not much larger than a small aircraft, or smaller than a very large balloon, also that it may have passed lower than the National Defence Building, although I do not positively recall it passing in front of the building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being of a scientific turn of mind, I believe that the most probably explanation would be a balloon, but not a toy or greetings balloon but something larger than those and smaller than a Hot Air Balloon. To conclude this positively, I would have to assume, however, that there was a brisk, but invisible wind at an altitude in excess of the height of the National Arts Centre and the Convention Centre on the opposite side of the Canal (4 to 6 stories), a wind which was curving downward over a short distance, perhaps less than the distance to Confederation Park beyond the National Arts Centre. I noticed not the slightest breeze where I stood, no wind in the branches of the trees by the National Arts Centre (some of which are nearly as tall as the building), and no cloud movement.<n>

Perfect sky, no clouds anywhere. While enjoying the day we looked up into the colbalt blue of the overhead sky and saw a tight &#34;Y&#34; formation of four silver dots, each about the size of a pinhead seen from a foot or so away. First thought was they were mylar ballons, but the perfect formation, then the change to a &#34;V&#34; made us wonder. They were not moving much, like you would expect from a formation of planes, from their position, but hovering. Then 2 of the dots started moving in slow broad circles around the others. After this, they started to split up, slowly, and seemed to go higher and less distinct. Again, we kept thinking childs ballons, but then a commercial jet when by, quite high up so the jet looked the size of a fly from about a foot away, and the &#34;dots&#34; were temporarly blocked by it as it passed. Within a few minutes of this, a smaller fast jet, possibly fighter, went past from west to east, and the objects then faded from view. If it were night, if they were going left to right or some similar course, I would compare the size an luminisity to a satalite, even in the daylight, but their movement was not linear, but as described above, hovering and making un-satalite type moves.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had NO wings at all.  I have never seen anything like it ever in my life.  The object had no lights that we could see.  It wasn&#39;t reflecting any sun that I could see.  It was a sunny day outside and it was in the daylight...I hope other people see it and report.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The weather was clear and sunny. We had walked to Pike Place Market and exited out to Post Alley to go and look at some of the furniture stores. As I waited outside while my wife looked in a shop, I looked up and noticed a shiny, cylindrical object hovering over the city. It appeared to be motionless, but occasionally it would appear to rotate slightly because the quality of the sun&#39;s reflection would change on its surface. I assumed that it was a helicopter, but I couldn&#39;t see any rotor blades. My wife came out of the store and I pointed the object out to her and we watched it for around 10 minutes. It didn&#39;t move during that time. We continued walking, and we went in a few stores over the next 20 minutes and each time we came back out onto the street the object was still in the same location, still rotating slightly causing the sunlight to glint off it. At one point, we stopped to watch an aircraft fly past it and as we did, we noticed a very tiny speck of white light (which I assumed to be a satellite or perhaps the ISS going past) travel past the object and stop. We continued to walk, and when I looked up again, the dot was gone but the cylyndrical object remained. After we had observed the object for approximately a half hour, it started to slowly drift to the southeast and we lost sight of it over the tall buildings in downtown Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Seemed to be in some sort of formation pattern two close together and one more distant creating a triangle than one dissapearing and then going higher in the sky and all three gone quickly then returning and closer to the earth and than shape change occured as I was looking through my camara lense shot several pictures this pattern has continued over several hours and continues now as I type this report.  It is very difficult to explain the exact shape and size of the crafts as they change.  Two are always together and one is always more distant.  The backround is perfectly blue sky with no clouds.  There is an airport close by but nothing like this has been seen before.  They are very slow moving at time and then complety dissapear so seems to be able to move rapidly. We called the news, they weren&#39;t interested.  They are able to change altitude so don&#39;t suggest any type of experimental aircraft as they move up and down like a helicopter and side to side without making a sound.  They have been very close to view with the naked eye and very far but seem to be staying in the general area.  Boeing is very close to us as well as a Navy base and Paine field airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request copies of the photos to try to identify the objects.  PD))<n>

I layed in bed for a while and absolutely couldn&#39;t sleep, then I put on some light music and went to lay down on my bed next to my window. I could tell that it was starting to get kind of light outside and I thought it would be cool to watch the sunrise since I was awake anyway. That&#39;s when I noticed in the distance just a gold shining ball. It looked like a huge gold star but I knew it was too big to be a star. So i thought it was a planet but it was moving toward me and it was getting bigger. As it got closer I could see the lights flashing on it and there were like these red and blue lights with gold lights on the bottom, the red and blue lights were on the sides. So i thought it was like some really weird fancy airplane, but it was a circle, and it just flew right by. I am really scared right now...I sat there and told myself it was a plane and to forget about it but I cant. It&#39;s just weird because the other day I was talking with my friends about UFO&#39;s and I was saying how i don&#39;t believe in them at all and that they&#39;re weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A few minutes later while looking at the same area in the Little Dipper I noticed another of the same type of object. I followed it this time with my telescope and was not able to keep up with it. I tried to focus on it better but it seemed to be in focus with other stars in the sky...

It was then that I saw a &#34;boomerang shaped&#34; figure traveling southwest. The figure had no audible engine noise emmiting from it and was riding quite slow. It paused for about 5 seconds then continued flying another ten seconds. It then again paused for another 3 seconds and continued flying on a south west bound course. I tried getting my wife to notice what I was looking at but she says saw nothing. About 3 minutes later I noticed the same object was traveling south, as if going towards the Brownsville direction. This time both my wife and I noticed the object, only this time it had a strange red hue to it. We continued looking at the &#34;UFO&#34; traveling south until it was no longer visible. This event made me quite nervous as I am not a firm believer in UFO&#39;s but it will forever change the way I look at the night sky!!!<n>
8/30/03 00:15|Merrick|NY|Other|45 minutes|4 elliptical lit objects surrounded by a haze/halo, proceeding to individually dive, climb, zigzag. Lasted about 45 minutes.|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31129.html|87|ndxe200308| 4 elliptical lit objects surrounded by a haze/halo, proceeding to individually dive, climb, zigzag. Lasted about 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside, to my backyard, at approximately 12:15 AM. I was sitting on a chair on my deck, facing east, towards Bellmore, when I noticed an elliptical shaped light/object moving at a high rate of speed across the sky, followed by another. It was not a shooting star, as I have seen those before. These were much, much larger! The objects were behind a haze that was in front of the objects. The sky had some cloud cover, but there was also clear patches of sky. The objects had a haze/halo in front of them, even in the portions of the sky that were not cloudy. At first, they passed in a straight line, with a short distance between them. One of them was brighter than the others, at times. They were larger, very much larger, than an aircraft. I called my husband to see them, and after about 2 seconds, he promptly dismissed the lights as the type of lights at a grand opening, and he went to bed. However, there was no beam going up to where the objects were, and the objects were not rounded, as grand opening large beams of light. I have seen grand opening beams, but never like what I witnessed in the sky, on Saturday night. I began to time the lights in the sky, to see if there was any kind of pattern to their movements, but there was no pattern. Another object then joined the other two, and several minutes later, a fourth object joined them. They appeared to be following each other. At this point, I didn’t think much of it, but my curiosity riveted me to the spot, as I have never seen anything like it in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live on the water, on the wide estuary that separates Merrick from Bellmore, a few hundred feet down from where Newbridge Park meets the water, so I had a clear view, with no tree line to obstruct my vision. The objects then switched from flying in more or less a straight line, to doing what I can only term as insane acrobatic type movements. They were individually zigzagging, diving, and going every which way, in steep ascents and descents. They weren’t following each other, at this point, but each doing *their own thing*. I watched as they came together (all 4 objects seemed to meld into one), for a few seconds, and then they split apart and began diving, climbing, and crossing the sky in a way I have never seen anything fly, dive, climb, in my entire life. This scenario kept being repeated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I phoned the police, to see if there were any events that might have large lights being beamed into the sky. The police had no knowledge of any events, nor would such events be permitted at such a late hour, due to local ordinances. I went back outside and continued to watch the scenario playing before my eyes, totally fascinated. I did not feel fear, nor did I feel any strange sensations, other than an amazing curiosity. I called the police about 15- 20 minutes later, asking if anyone else had reported seeing what I saw, but no one reported it. (They probably thought I was nuts-I was beginning to think so, myself!) They asked if I wanted a car to come to my home, but I declined, as there was nothing to be done about whatever it was that was in the sky, and they would assume I was a real nut case.. Two airplanes flew over my house during this time, one small plane, and one commercial jetliner. That only served to confirm that what I was seeing was not an airplane.  The lights were as different in size and shape, as night and day, as was the altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed a regular flashlight, and one of those powerful beam flashlights, to see if I could duplicate what I was seeing, with the idea that perhaps it was kids playing with flashlights, across the water. With both the regular flashlight, and the beam flashlight, I could not shine a beam up without seeing the path of the beam. In another words, I saw a trail of light on the beam going up, as I was shining it, whereas, whatever was up there, had no beam leading up to it.  What ever the heck it was that I saw, seemed to be creating its own light. Furthermore, the light from the flashlight and the beam light would not go even a fraction as high as the light that was coming from these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next thought was heat lightening, but this was not like any heat lightening I had ever seen. These were individual, specific lights, despite the halos around them. Heat lightening crossed my mind, as a possibility, due to the haze/halo around the objects, but then realized heat lightening was quite different than what I was observing, not being individual lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 12:45 I went upstairs and got into bed. My 6-foot bedroom casement windows faced the area of the sky in which the acrobatics were taking place, so I watched from my bed. At 1:08 A.M, I became so fascinated by what I was observing, that I decided to get my binoculars, so I could try to see more clearly, to try to solve the mystery that was playing out before my eyes. I went downstairs to get my binoculars, but when I came back upstairs, the objects had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a mature adult, a 58-year-old woman, and had no drinks at dinner or after dinner, other than a diet coke. I rarely ever have a drink, and then, only a beer, on occasion. I feel like a fool reporting this, but I know what I saw, and have never seen anything like it in my entire life. I sure wish someone could find a rational explanation for what I observed.. I have not seen the objects again, since Saturday night, but I will tell you that I am very hesitant to go outside again, alone, late at night, after what I witnessed. I wasn’t afraid, then, as my curiosity left no room for fear, that night, but now, I would not be comfortable being alone outside, late at night. I sure as heck hope you will tell me someone had an opening event with weird lights, despite the local ordinances, but I truly do not believe this was the case...<n>

(I tend to collect a batch of films and then send them all together to Clark Color Lab.

Thinking it&#39;s just dirty print, I looked for the negs so I could send them back to the lab and have them do these 2 shots over again. I was very surprised to find these shapes in the negatives!  Where can I take the negs and prints for further analysis?  Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I decided to find the first turn to the left (south) to see how close I could get.  I had my digital camera with me and it was my intention to photograph.  I turned from Division onto NW Angeline St. (southbound)  The street was lined with many tall fir trees and I could still see the light intermittently through the trees. Hoping to hear if what I was seeing was just a hovering helicopter, I turned off the radio and fan, and rolled down all of the car windows. I contiuned south on Angeline until I came to NW 5th where I then turned left (east).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I had a very clear view of the object.  I could now see that it was triangular in shape with two bright lights on two of the corners and the red light was on the third corner. Luckily I wasn&#39;t the only one to see this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two men who were standing on the left side of the street (NW 5th) were looking up at the object.  Further down the street, a car was slowly moving toward the object with the driver looking up towards the triangle.  Two girls, who were running down the street behind the car, were also looking up and pointing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the windows rolled down, I tried to hear what, if any sound the object was making.  It was absolutely silent.  Over the years I have seen Police, News, and Rescue helicopters flying all over the Portland area.  If this were a helicopter hovering over a quiet residential neighborhood it would have been terrifically loud at its altitude.  The most striking thing besides the silence, was the incredible stability of the object.  It sat so still you would think it was affixed to the top of a tower. Helicopters hovering have a bit of wobble and drift, however slight.  This was rock solid.  I can&#39;t stress this point enough.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen pictures of the Phoenix lights, the Belgium Triangle, Lubbock lights, etc, and this was very similar.  While it was not possible from my point of view to discern surface details, it appeared to be very large (fifty to one hundred feet or more across) and an equilateral triangle.  Since I was looking up at the object, it was not possible to estimate the height or thickness of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I moved further east on NW 5th, the triangle suddenly started to move. It may have been a reaction to so many people all moving towards it at once. But it may have been a coincidence. It pivoted on its center to face to the Northeast.  As is turned it began to accelerate.  Again, it was absolutely silent.   And what was the most striking was the weirdly perfect precision of the turn.  Not like a helicopter that will wobble slightly while turning, then tilt forward to accelerate.  This move reminded me of the too precise way a computer simulation can be. (If done wrong)  In film and television computer animation, an animator will intentionally add small bumps, tilts, or wobbles to make the animation seem more &#34;real&#34; or lifelike.  This thing turned and began moving in one smooth perfect motion.  If an animator produced a motion like this, it would be rejected as too smooth and fake looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to follow it by taking the next available left turn (onto Towle Rd) and continued north.  The street was lined with fir trees and it was rapidly moving to the NE making it difficult to see.  Towle road has numerous speed bumps, so it was not possible to keep up.  As I reached Division St. (the street I was originally travelling on when I first sighted the object) I could see two bright white lights of the back of the triangle.  The red light was no longer visible, so I assumed it was either off, or that it was on the corner pointed away from me.  (Was it the &#39;front&#39;?)  I turned left on Division St. and was now traveling east to west again.  As there are houses and trees along this part of Division it was difficult to keep track of the triangle.  As I approached the intersection of Birdsdale and Division I could see that it was now what appeared to be two to four miles away moving faster to the NE.  If it continued in that direction it would have come very close to Portland International Airport and the Air National Guard.  Within a few seconds it was gone from sight.  It was now 10:37.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain it was not a plane or helicopter.  The complete lack of any sound would rule those out as possibilities. A Harrier Jet might be able to stay relatively still and then accelerate something like this did, but not stay completely motionless.  Plus the Harrier is quite loud hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was it a blimp or some sort of balloon?   Even blimps and balloons hovering make some movement.  This was sitting rock steady in one spot.  And the speed at which it accelerated would have required some sort of jet or prop engine.  This was silent.  Absolutely, completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to pass my report along to ((investigator)).

Conventional aircraft are in this area all the time, and local residents are accustomed to seeing them.  One witness also observed and clearly identified a commercial airliner that flew over minutes after the sighting of the unknown object.  Both witnesses agree on basic details, essentially that a triangular object with lights near the corners, hovered over a residential area at well under 1,000 feet (the FAA mandated minimum altitude above terrain).  This craft hovered silently for several seconds, then departed rapidly in a northerly or northwesterly direction.

8/29/03 20:58|Atlantic City|NJ|Light|For minutes|I saw lights in the sky while coming back from Atlantic City in a bus!|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31092.html|93|ndxe200308| I saw lights in the sky while coming back from Atlantic City in a bus!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, I&#39;m 14 years old and my name&#39;s ((name deleted)). I went with my mom and dad to Atlantic city on a travel bus. When we were going back to where I am from (that&#39;s Elizabeth, New jersey) the bus lights went off so that everyone could sleep (it was 6:40 when we left) My mom and I tryed to sleep but couldn&#39;t, at the end my mom fell asleep but I kept looking out the window. Finally I got some sleep and woke up about 8:40 or 8:48 PM. It was night and the sky was dark, wind was blowing from the looks of it (All the windows were closed) and the cars were passing by fast. When I look at the sky, I see the moon and far away from it one star, one lonely star, I told my mom and she looked at it. Indeed it was a star... but then all of a sudden two flashing lights appear above it, way above it. The lights were blinking and I didn&#39;t take them for importance because I thought they were planes... but then 3 more appeared to the left of them, below them. I was surprised and started watching closely... Not wanting to tell my mom because she was sleeping. One of the lights that appeared earlier stopped blinking and become very bright, then went upwards into the sky, VERY fast. It was going fast and far away into the clouds. By this time I didn&#39;t think it was a plane...<n> <n><n> <n><n> They had no sound (but we had the windows closed so we couldn&#39;t know.) Then the other 2 that appeared earlier went right, very fast and the others who appeared later stopped blinking and disappeared completely... Anyways... they disappeared and I went back to sleep, then woke up again and was (8:58 PM) ...and the freaking bus still didn&#39;t make it to Elizabeth... when I look out the window, there was a blinking light... and it was going down on some bushes/forest. I looked closely and 3 more blinking lights appeared near it and went upwards then to the right and finally disappeared into the clouds... I made my mom look and she was surprised that anything could move like that... There was also two jet-like planes (or maybe the same lights but closer?...) that were chasing those lights.. They were only two and they passed right above the bus... they moved like planes... so I thought they were jet-planes... they disappeared into the clouds in the direction of the &#34;light&#34; objects. I just shrugged and went back to sleep. By the time I woke up we were already back. Personally, I have never seen such sighting in my life. I mean... Maybe sometimes I see a ball of light moving then disappearing but I have never seen groups and appearances like that... I was scared! hehe... We got out of the bus, bought something to eat, went home, ate and we slept happily ever after... Then I woke up and came to this site... started writing. That&#39;s my sighting and how I left atlantic city.<n>

We were staying on the east/south east side of the island. Sitting on the beach at about 10-10:30 pm we all four noticed what we thought were 2 falling stars traveling downward from north-west to east-south-east at approximately a 50-60 degree angle. We watched these white stars/lights fall for several (5-8)seconds, long enough for everyone to comment how cool it was to see 2 falling stars at the same time traveling parrell to one another. Then, faster than I have ever seen any object in the sky move before, these 2 light-objects simultaneously changed direction and headed upward (south) at approximately a 120+ degree angle, &#34;bowed-out&#34; away from each other then joined back parallell to each other, then in what was literally a blink of an eye the lower-left object shot outward (east) at an approximate 95-110 degree angle away from the 2nd object, then both objects were gone. As the four of us were discussing what we&#39;d just witnessed and debating what the objects could have been, a single light came out of the sky from the south heading northward and shot across the sky in a waivering-undulating pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 44 y/o man who works for a major telecommunications corportation as a Corporate Account Manager, my wife is 43 y/o and works in accounting for a fortune 500 company, my best friend is a 38 y/o professional real-estate agent and his wife is a 44 y/o registered nurse. None of us has ever witnessed anything like this before in our lives or know of anyone else who has. We all agree that these lights/objects traveled and moved at speeds, patterns, and angles much differently from anything we have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We reached the post around 1:15AM.  My brother and I stood outside and drank some beers and the time just flew!  My brother all of a sudden told me to take a look at this helicopter that must have stopped someone on the I15.  But, as the time continued to go (around a half an hour 4:00 AM to 4:30 AM) the helicopter never moved.  We assumed it was a police helicopter because the lights at first were only red and blue flashing lights.  This was around 4:30 AM and the lights started flashing in this order, red, blue, green, and yellow very very quickly.  I told him that I was going to go wake up my girlfriend so that she could prove that we were not seeing things!  He woke his wife and I woke my girlfriend and at first, they thought It was Mars but mars was directly behind us.  As we all starred together we noticed it started moving quickly then slowly then it appeared to get close then far, but it only stood in a certain section of the sky.  At around 5:00 AM it went out like a candle light, but for whatever reason it reappeared.  We were tired so we went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a &#34;twinkling&#34; star would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out, before we could accept that the object was a &#34;bona fide&#34; UFO.  PD))<n>

I had strange effects, as I would tape I would loose all track of what I was doing, and then realize I was watching this strange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tape is amazing, showed it to my family and still can&#39;t explain why what I was looking at and taping are so different. The tape is amazing, has this large white grey egg that dances, and changes shape, like a saucer so flexible and gets up real close and then explodes like a fire work display, but comes right back, but it has its own energy, does not move in one direction like a plane, but dances up to you and around and just has a life like a huge fly. WHAT IS IT. I am making myself crazy. Will go out again tonight to see if it comes back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a copy of the tape for inspection.  PD))<n>

We do not know if it was UFO related. Our family had gone to bed for the night, when my daughter entered my bedroom and expressed concerned over an outside &#34;light&#34; that was visible through the mini-blinds covering her bedroom window. I entered her room and without opening the blinds, could see what would best be described as a strobe-like light. The angle of my view would not allow me to see the actual source of the light. We could only see the strobe effect within the beam. The beam diffusion was such that the light source must have been coming from above the window. We watched it together for about a minute. Then we decided to go outside to find out what it may be. The time lapse to go from the bedroom to outside was no more than a minute. Once outside, we found nothing. No light source, nothing. We live in a rural area and our residence is situated higher than the road we live on so I can probably rule out any car source. There are no street lights in our area. When it&#39;s nightime, it&#39;s dark here. I cannot explain or comprehend what my daughter and I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Since I was driving I was only able to see it as a very white bright light, I thought at first that it had been a shooting Comet or Meteorite Because it was so big! and it was definitely very close to the City and what  seemed above the buildings. At that moment what went through my mind was &#34;Oh my God that meteorite/comet is going to hit some buildings it was really so close that I said it will hit something how could it not!

It was not very high above the ground and I was able to watch it for about 1 and a 1/2 minutes.  The night was so clear and still you could hear a mouse in the woods at 100 yards away. The milky way was as bright as it gets.  This object made NO sound and kinda jerked as it moved in a straight path heading North East. The object was brighter than anything in the sky by far &amp; had a red glow with a very different look that I had never seen before. Its been 5 days now and I felt I should file a repost to see if anyone else had seen the same thing.  I am 41 years old and have had my own contracting business for over 18 years. I have been married for 15 years with 2 children.<n>

What I could see was the wing portion of the craft. Each wing starts off straight, but then is bent upwards around the mid-length of the wing and then bent downwards to form two sides of a triangle. The under side of the wings(the part I could see) appeared to have what looked like veins that emmitted a low intencity green light. The light intencity from the craft was not strong enough to overcome the light intencity of our street lights in our parking lot. Using buildings and trees as a heighth and width reference I would say that the craft was flying at 60-100 Ft. off the ground. The wing span I would estimate at being 40-60 Ft. in length. The speed of the craft at about 10 M.P.H. I could not understand how a winged craft moving that slow not only did&#39;nt run into a stall speed problem, but concidering the altitude, that it did not emit any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At around 11 pm the adults were sitting outside the cabin enjoying a beutiful summer night, the sky was clear (on which we were making comments about how crystal and big the stars were) when we noticed a bright light literally on top of a small mountain direclty across from our mountain, about a 1/4 of a mile away, we were basically at the same height and the light was in direct line of sight.  We started speculating as to what it was, our best guess was a flood light on a cabin? only there were no cabins on that mountain.  After 10 minutes or so of discussing it, we lost interest and went on to other subjects when suddenly the light went out.  About fifteen minutes later, the light reappeared only this time it was about 100 feet above the same location, and more intense.  It was about the size of a quarter when my arm was outreached, it was a yellowish/orange color and had no sound.  We were all speculating as to what it could be but nothing conventional fit, we watched it for 10-15 minutes when I noticed it was very slowly rising (there was a big pine tree right underneath it and based on the trees upmost tip is how I first noticed that it rising).  After it was about an additional 100 feet in the air (about 1/2 an hour after it first appeared in the sky) three small, very intenensly bright white lights, they reminded me of a diamonds sparkle, appeared around the first light.  After a few minutes all three of the smaller lights darted, in a zig-zag manner to the south at a very high speed, we lost sight of them behind a mountain.  At this point the first, large light started slowly dimming out until it wasnt visible, then it would slowly dim on to its original brightness, the cycle would take about 5 minutes from bright to dim to bright agian.  At the same it was acsending a little faster than earlier but still very slowly. We watched it ascend until it was out of sight, about an hour after the little lights had darted off.  This wasnt a specutlar sighting from what I&#39;ve read since, but it really raised my curiosity on this issue.  One peculiar fact I&#39;ll like to point out, before the incident, I had noticed airplanes on a north-western path above us, one about every 20 minutes or so (the red blinking lights stood out in that crystal clear sky), during the sighting, no planes flew over.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/28/03 23:00|St. Laurent (Canada)|MB|Unknown|several minutes|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  St. Laurent, Manitoba, Lights And Creature.|9/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31821.html|107|ndxe200308| St. Laurent, Manitoba, Lights And Creature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a telephone call from a gentleman from St. Laurent, Manitoba on September 22, 2003. The area where this event took place is mainly a Matee community. The fellow I talked to said he and his wife bought a business  and have lived in the community for thirteen years and know many of the area residents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the last week of August, 2003 four youths were driving south of St. Laurent towards the golf course on golf course road (as many folks there call it). The road runs by Francis Lake and the golf course is on the left hand side of the road when traveling south. As they drove along they noticed an abandoned vehicle off to the side of the road across from the golf course. At this point they all saw flashing lights over and above one of the buildings on the course. The lights seemed to be sitting stationary in one spot and low over the sheds. They assumed, after seeing the car pulled off to the side of the road and the lights flashing,  that someone may have been breaking into the sheds. Two of the young men decided to sneak in to see if they might catch someone causing damage, the other two  went back home to get their parents and have them come down to the area where all this was taking place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two youths were approximately half way into the course and as they approached a small road which passed by one of the dugouts, they heard a very loud, piercing scream. As they kept walking for approx: another 100 feet, all of a sudden this &#34;thing&#34; was right in front of them and screaming out this loud screeching noise. A three foot high creature ran in front of them and it was only about 25 feet away. Both witnesses were taken totally by surprise and very frightened as they had no idea what this thing was. It didn&#39;t help that it was dark outside. Both of them ran back towards the road where they had been dropped off, but seeing they did not have a vehicle they cowered in the ditch which ran along side the road hoping that whatever it was they saw would not find them. Finally their two friends returned with a couple of the parents and when the vehicle stopped the two guys who witnessed the creature, hurridly  jumped  into the vehicle. &#34;Let&#39;s get out of here&#34; they said .... however the parents did go and check the buildings and found nothing had been disturbed.   They all talked about the event on their way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights which were seen hovering over the buildings were a red, greenish and white colour.  The witnesses  mentioned that not a sound could be heard coming from where the lights were seen. Also they  claimed seeing another light hovering over Francis Lake which was totally red.  Again not a sound could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the same night, shortly after the above sighting ......another man, driving his van, had to slam on his brakes to avoid hitting  a similar creature. He claimed that it was about 10 feet in front of him when he finally came to a complete stop. It moved to the driver&#39;s side of the van and squatted down, bending slightly to one side, looked up at the frightened driver.  The man described the creature as being small and having a protruding jaw filled with a number of teeth. He put the truck into reverse and headed out of there as fast as he could.  After thinking about what just happened, and what he saw, he broke down and started to cry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another series of events have taken place in the same general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A local resident who had some 27 chickens well penned up in a &#34;heavy steel wired&#34; area, found on the following day, that 20 of his poultry had disappeared.  A large hole had been ripped in the strong wire fence. The resident looked around the area and found one chicken still partly alive in the bushes behind their home  and it had two puncture holes at the base of its neck.  No other chickens were found.  Strangely, also there has been a large number of domestic cats which have gone missing just over the same time period, which is definitely not normal and there does not seem to be any explanation for their disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fellow claims that there is a lot of history of unknown objects being seen in and around the community. He also said that the creature had been spotted on other occasions throughout the St. Laurent area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were strange, the creature was strange...  what they were and whether or not they were connected is anyone&#39;s guess.   There does seem to be something very weird happening in this particular part of Canada.   I will continue to look into this and see what, if anything more , I can discover about it.  Due to the community being tight lipped about such strange events its not going to be an easy task.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

As I kept driving the ligts kept flying south until they stopped above i40 approx 3 miles east of us. The craft started to ilumminate the road, I could see both sides of the high way ilumminated (east/west bound lanes). As I got closer the craft turned the lights off and started heading west towards us. As it got closer I could see the lights under the craft, nothing I had ever seen before. The lights look like diamond shape and soft yellow, violet and green iluminated from them with a red light in the middle. Triangular was the shape of the craft and could not hear a sound from it. It look like it was just floating in the air. As the craft kept getting closer it started going north west until it disappear in to the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know there were other vehicles comming west and few going east on this Thursday August 28 at about 11:00 pm. and probably saw the same craft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite convincing and objective to us.  We suspect he is a very good witness.  We would like to hear from other witnesses to the same event.  PD))<n>

The sound was unlike any we had ever heard. It was a whirling sound almost like the sound of air vibrating when you are spinning something very fast.  I saw three steady lights through the blinds in her window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out the window and saw a white air craft that was narrow on one end and got wider towards the other end, kind of like a teardrop.  On the bottom of the craft were 3 steady lights in a triangular shape.  They didn&#39;t blink or change color or anything like that.  The sides of it appeared to be blue.  It was kind of hovering outside the window and then started moving slowly to the right.  I Only looked at it for a few seconds and told my friend that it was a blimp.  She didn&#39;t believe that it was a blimp because of the sound she heard.  She looked out the window about two seconds after I moved away from it and she couldn&#39;t see it but we still heard it.  She immediatley ran outside hoping to get a glimpse of it but it was no where in sight even though she could still here it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what I saw.  But I do know that it was not an airplane because it did not have any wings, it was not a helicopter because there were no propellers and nothing underneath the craft other than the lights on its bottom. And we figure that it was not a blimp because as I said there was nothing underneath it other than the lights and blimps do not advertise at 11p.m. Also the sound was not like that of a helicopter or airplane.  I know what airplanes sound like I live near the airport, and this was no airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to know if anyone else has seen this or has some other explanation.<n>

It had a sort of throbbing sonic sound to it. At first I thoght it was a ambulance or fire truck at first and I thought I wonder what is going on ,so I got up to see what was going on. When I first looked at it I was thinking what in the blakety blank is that! I remember saying again what in the heck is that! Then it hit me that it was a UFO! It was oblong like a cigar and ahad a soft glowing light at one end of it and a very bright pulsating light at the other end of it. You could acually here it like a pulsating throb.as I was watching it it started to turn real slow in a circular motion, I turned around real fast to wake up my husband and I told him hurry up and get up there is a UFO out here! He started to jump up and I was turning around to look back out the window and it was gone! There is noway that something that big got away that fast! My husband and I went outside to see if we could see anything. We were out there about ten minutes seeing nothing . We came back in the house and went back to bed. Short time later maybe five minutes or so we started seeing different lights, but they were apache helicopters with search lights on swarming the area. They continued to do that back and forth for about two or three hoursor more because I fell asleep finally about one ,two o`clock in the morning.  The funny thing is my middle child came in our bedroom about three days before this incident wild eyed and said she had seen a UFO and we kind of laugheds at her and told her to go back to bed . It was around the same time that I had seen mine ,about ten thirty.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned north off of the main Hwy. and as I cleared some trees to my left I noticed a row of lights about 1 mile to the NW of my present location.  As this light was located on my farm property, and in a remote location, I was concerned that someone was trespessing on my property.  There were a row 5 white lights with smaller red lights in between the white ones.  They seemed to have a concave spacing, did not blink or move, and did not give off a beam as a light might if it were lighting up an area. (Like a baseball field) although it seemed to cover an area of several hundred yards.(from one end to the other) I proceeded immediately north on the farm road and turned left (west)onto an intersecting east/west farm road.  As I continued west, I could see the tree line under the lights which gave me a reference to its location.  As I continued west down the farm road, I noticed the lights starting to flicker, as if trees were getting between me and the light source. When I reached the end of the road, the flickering lights were now due north, about 400 yards.  As I turned north, I could no longer see any light.  I then thought trees had gotten between me and the lights, so I backtracked east on the road I had approached from.  I never saw the lights again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The overall size of the light grouping was quite large.  It would have covered an area the size of a baseball field.  I own 850 acres of farm land with the home place in the very middle.  There are no other buildings or structures and there is no electricity or power lines in this remote area.  I have since watched this area each night since the original sighting with no results.  I did not observe any object attached to these lights, nor did they move other than blinking out. It made no sound that I heard.  I went to the site the next day and found no evidence in the freshly cultivated fields on either side of the tree line or in the tree line.  I can&#39;t explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 9:30 pm my brother (39) and I (33) and our two children were in the back yard looking for Mars as it is reported to be at it&#39;s closest to earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw what appeared to be a star traveling from south to north. There were no flashing lights that would indicate that it was an aircraft. As it flew across the sky slowly and parallel to some stars we noticed that it then moved in a &#34;snake like&#34; manner, swinging left and right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my brother if he had a camcorder to see if he could zoom in on it. He ran inside, I kept my eye on the object as it travelled north. He came out with his binoculars and we both took turns looking at the object. We did not see any flashing lights when viewed through the binoculars.

After 6 or 7 seconds, pattern of three lights &#39;jumped&#39; to viewer&#39;s left, approximately 100 feet.  After approximately 3 more seconds, these lights extinguished simultaneously with a new series of lights  approximately 500 feet to the right, and approximately 200 feet higher than first observation.  The first of these lights appeared to be a single light, then jumped to viewer&#39;s left and down, becoming two lights, then jumped left and down again, becoming three lights.  Elapsed time of second series was approximately 6 to 7 seconds.  As each new set of lights became visible, the previous light extinguished almost as if by toggling a light switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 23 minutes later, a new series of three orange lights was seen in identical location to initial sighting.

On our way home I looked over and saw a white light in the sky, just a medium size light that was not moving at all, I thought it was just one of those lights that guides planes, then not even in a blink of an eye it went from a medium size to big to very tiny and started moving very fast. It all happened so quickly that I didn&#39;t even have time to tell my sister what I was seeing until it had shrunk. It confused me alot and frightened her. But I didn&#39;t really think anything of it at the time so I just went home and didn&#39;t continue to watch it. And a day or so later I started hearing other people saying they had been seeing something in the sky that was a stereotypical UFO or something that would light the sky up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional Information:  The sighting only lasted for about two minutes, my home was only about three houses away when I saw the object so I just ran home, went inside, and didn&#39;t really think of it till I started to hear more similar stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still light out, but just starting to get dark they sky was still blue though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was roughly around pea size to nickel size to pretty much &#39;pin prick&#39; size  It was completely still when I first noticed it, that&#39;s why I thought it was just a &#39;light&#39; tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright white light and what is odd is it stayed white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was nothing like I had ever seen before, nothing like a plane, satellite or shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Personal information deleted by HBCC UFO).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

I was visiting my son and daughter in law on a mountain where they had an apartment on the end of a large building. We walked out at dark to see the star &#34;Mars,&#34; but when we walked out straight ahead was a Very Bright Star and my son ((name deleted)) thought that was Mars, and I said NO Mars is more to the South, that Star is to the East... we got to the end of the large building and sure enough there was Mars.... BUT.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were intrigued by this &#39;other star&#39; as it was so bright and went to the edge of the mountain (we were on the top of a gravel pit yard)... and as we were watching this &#39;star&#39; it rose up directly upward quite a ways and we couldn&#39;t believe what we saw ... and then after only seconds watching it,,, i said,,, I think it is &#39;coming&#39; toward us and we all started running back to the door way of the apartment (while my son got his camera out of his truck he used every day for work)... when we were at the door way we looked up and the object was colorfully lit up with the most beautiful lights I had ever seen in my life... they were gorgeous.... not so many lights were in the front of the object that appeared around 75 feet long ~ was an oblong shape.... my son&#39;s camera would NOT WORK and we were very disappointed... my daughter in law wanted to run out under the object that was just above the tree tops (around 70 feet) and I would not let her go because I had seen the movie: FIRE IN THE SKY ~ and did not trust whatever this object was about... we blinked and then it was GONE ~ that quickly... didn&#39;t even see it take off  It just vanished faster than we could even turn our heads.... we were all in total shock because NO SOUND CAME FROM THE CRAFT.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> This really did happen and we have never forgotten it!

What caught my eye was the slowness of the object&#39;s forward motion.  I don&#39;t think it was moving forward fast enough to maintain loft.  As I watched, I noticed that the object did not have any part that reflected any shine, although it was a bright sunny day. It passed into a white cloud and came out the other side. I watched until it became obscured by trees.Object left no trail at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went outside and saw a very bright light directly overhead right at sunrise.  It was golden like Mars.  I assumed that it was Mars.  It was big and much brighter than Mars.  I ran inside to tell my family.  When I came out, it vanished. I would later spot Mars, and view Mars over a two hour period of time.  This definitely was not Mars.  Mars would not even be in that position at that time of day.  I later realized that I had seen a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking at the night shy though my night vision goggles and noticed lots more stars, planets, satallites, and other things. I was looking at a planet / star group and noticed a light appear from it and it was flying at a decent speed. The light did numorous figure-eight patterns while in flight. It also made a sharp u-turn twice. While I was looking at the object with my NVG&#39;s I decided to flash the infrared sensor at it. The object then stopped, flashed back, and proceeded to the same area where it came from. Once it had gotten to the area it disappeared. I have also noticed other lights while looking at the night sky, though I identified them as meteorites as they when in a straight path at top speeds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area of CMTC is heavily wooded in most areas. All though the area I was in was clear. There is street lights in the area, but it didn&#39;t affect the NVG&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Right before going to sleep, after spending several hours of reading, I often turn out the lights in my apartment and look out toward the woods bordering our property from my living room window.  Something, a flash of light or pinpoint of light with motion caught my eye.  Looking due North I saw a brilliant white light about a dime in circumfurance rise up from behind the tree line, stand stock still for perhaps 30 seconds, and then begin moving forward on a direct line apparently meant to intersect and pass over our apartment building.  Being stunned and slightly incredulous, I just sat there staring as it moved very, very slowly directly on a straight line probably a couple of hundred feet in altitude.  I saw it move directly overhead and pass from view.  I llstened very intently, turning off my floor fan as soon as I knew it was on the move!  Its light was intense, white, unwavering, and constant.  There was absolutely no sound, even after it passed overhead.  I continued to stand watch at the window another 10 or 15 minutes trying to clarify, for my own benefit, what I had just witnessed.  It definitely was not a plane, blimp, ultra-lite craft, heliocopter, or any other aerial craft I have ever seen, since its motion was more like floating than flying.  This is the clearest view, yet of what I have been seeing in the skies in this area since sometime in the Fall last year.  Did anyone else see this, is my first question? I am a rational, responsible male, having held several government jobs requiring security clearances!  Thank YOU!<n>

At the time the camera was set on a fixed tripod on telescopic, &#34;super night vision&#34; mode, and background stars can be seen accompanying Mars&#39;s progress across the night sky, while the point of light traveled in the opposite direction!  The light shone steadily and did not appear to be an aircraft or a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched and waited but it did not seem to go away or come closer so curiosity took over and I looked even closer at this object to see weather it were an small single engine aircraft or helicopter. I watched as this object seemed only to move slightly up down and around in a very narrow window of area, as it began to move more noticibly, it&#39;s movement seemed to become erratic with short jerky meandering motions with a strange purposefullness about it. As I watched it I noticed it had 6 lightsin a sort of delta pattern, the lights were blinking simultaneously going from nearly white-(canary diamond white)-to beautifull orangish amber- these colors continued alternating one color change cycle per second for the duration from the time that I actually percieved  the blinking...which was actually from the very beginning. As I watched this object it began to descend a little bit and then it cycled it&#39;s lights down to orange then it slowly dimmed out within 2 seconds to a really dark cherry color and then to an allmost black amorphous shape with the still visible dark red color in the center near the bottom of the object. This phase remained for about 5 seconds then the lights turned back on again as it were and the fullest intensity of white light came from the 6 lights and it resumed it&#39;s cyclical blinking and then began to ascend diagonally south/southwest...while I was due east of it. The object then leveled off and began to move at a relatively slow pace-(considerably less than common commercial aircraft minus small single prop types)-I then noticed anoth! er same object way to the right/north of the other object and still west of me. The newly appeared object appeared suddenly as out of nowhere, or the timer turned on the lights...well this thing just was going at at least a 70 degree angle and had no difficulty gaining altitude and covered several thousand feet at a speed that  &#34;seemed&#34; to move around 1500-2000 mph at this time I ran downstairs to show the security guard but I realized that he would not have been able to see it from his perspective and then ran inside to call a friend. I came back outside to look for the first object and noticed that it was not in my field of view anymore and the second was stationary [or it seemed]very high in the sky as if it were a bright star roughly was around the same general vicinity as where I last saw it except higher. I may be mistaken as it might have been a star which seemed to shimmer like a neutron star. I did not bother to continue to watch this star to see any changes and then heard my phone ring so I went to get it. Note:The sky was very clear that night because it had rained a day earlier. I do not wear glasses or contacts and have relatively good eyesight. The entire duration of the movement of the object never once did it or they seem to bank or turn on any deviant axis from their original longitudinal /horizontal fixing...when it or they moved it was only up down or around with a very 2 dimensional quality in the sence -(to repeat )-that they only showed &#34;face&#34; or one profile continually. The brilliance of the lights made them very cleary defined that is why I can reccolect 6 lights in their pattern on theobjects #1 and #2...as in the order first described. When the #1 first dimmed out to a blackish amorphous object there were originally 6lights on the object untill it went dark then it seemed to have one dark cherry red glow about the center before resuming blink mode. I truly regret not having a video camera or at least a large pair of binoculars, this was an incredible event to me even though some! what surrealistic...the feeling that I got from viewing this/these objects was that of something intelligently controlled with the intention of being seen...with an otherworldly feel from it which gave me chills at one point while viewing it, at the same time being totally exhuberant like I had won the lottery. I am not a pilot or have ever been...I am a sky watcher -(no optics)- I do not posess any licenses or badges etc. Just a regular guy and no less credible according to my own perspective. This is not the first time I have seen strange things of this sort both here and abroad...I suppose that if you look up often enough you will see all sorts of things. I could not really get a relative idea of the distance of the objects because of the unknowable size of them...a crude guestimate would put them at 5 miles near the vicinity of harwin street @ beltway 8 southwest houston or further. I will send a keymap copy of my point of referance.  sincerely j.c. You may make a summary description for me if you wish-feel free to use this as you please and also mail this back to me as for me to have a written copy of this incident as I did not write it in the beginning or cannot remember where I put the rough draft and allthough this may sound contrived it is the truth...thank you .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While trying to find Mars, we both noticed 2 very bright stars (we didn&#39;t mention them to each other, but kept trying to locate Mars).  We located Mars, and then one of us mentioned the 2 bright stars we had seen.  We both found the 2 bright stars again and looked at them for a few seconds (had to look straight up with our necks craned) and then they both started moving.  They went up into the sky (you could tell they were going up - not just fading) and, then instead of going up (vertically), they started going &#34;sideways&#34; (horizontally) in the same direction (toward the south, I think) and then just disappeared after about 15-20 seconds.  They both moved while keeping the same distance apart the whole time.  We stayed outside for a few minutes afterwards, but didn&#39;t see anything else move, so we came inside.  These 2 objects looked just like big, bright stars.  They were too high to be airplanes, they made no sounds, and they nothing was flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We think it was in front of some clouds at some point, so don&#39;t think it was astronomical in nature.  Was similar to a satellite, except brighter and much too rapid (as well as for any known aircraft). On the other hand, it was  much too slow to have been a meteor.  No sound could be heard, nor navigation markers seen. Very puzzling, and I have observed the sky casually and as amateur astronomer for several decades.  Have seen missile tests in the atmosphere as well, and this didn&#39;t resemble that (also doubtful such a test would be performed so apparently close to populated area).

Myself, my Wife as well as my big sister came along also. I am an avid astronomy buff &amp; had set my Meade Telescope for a view of Mars, as it is so close and a clear night would benefit viewing, along with the altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed a laser shooting into the sky, apparently coming from atop one of the radar towers which we as kids used to call &#34;big golf balls&#34; as they used to look like when they were covered with the white circular enclosures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minuted the laser stopped and about a half mile behind it, (facing the western sky) a fuzzy red kind of smeared oval just dropped out of the sky approx. 1000 feet high, and slowly moved to the east at a five degree angle, horizontally. And then just stopped and faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With my years of sky watching I am sure this was not a meteor, jet, copter or exhaust from a airplane.  This moved with intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of us spotted it and found it unusual that this device would be in such a close proximity to the laser signal. Which is obviously what it is and what it was doing at that specific time, with this UFO device so close to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is FACT as I am a natural born American and hold true to respect and serve the Red, White and Blue.

I saw three bright orange objects in the western sky at what I estimate to be six or seven thousand feet altitude above the desert floor. Two of the objects were at the altitude mentioned, the third was below the other two at about two thousand feet. The objects appeared to be stationary and were approximately 30 to 40 miles distant. I estimated their actual location to be about 20 miles directly south of the city of Phoenix. This area represents the very eastern edge of the Barry Goldwater Test Range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point these lights were extemely bright compared to every other light source in that direction. After I first sighted them, I pulled off the road and watched them through my driver side window for about ten minutes. At the end of that period they quickly faded out and were replaced with two more similar objects at about the same altitude. I knew this location to be near the Goldwater test range and had observed lights there in times past. However, those lights were moving and weren&#39;t nearly as bright and bluish white in color. The lights I observed last night were incredibly bright with a bright orange, almost yellow hue. They were also pulsating irregularly. The second set of lights faded out quickly just as the first set had done. I then got back on the road and continued driving west. About ten minutes later I saw another set of lights pop on and decided to head to that location as fast as I could. It took me about 50 minutes to get to that location. En route the lights kept popping on and fading out as they had done before. When I finally approached the area a new set of lights appeared approx. 3 to 4 miles from where I stopped the car. At this point I could make out the diamond shape. Again, they were stationary. Had they been military flares on the test range, they would have been slowly descending and I would have seen smoke and small parachutes. However, that was not the case. At my close proximity I observed that they still had a bright orange color. There was no sound. I saw no other aircraft in the area except for commercial flights heading to Sky Harbor airport from the west. By about 11:00 pm, the activity ceased and I drove back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If this was a military exercise using flares, they are the most unusual flares I&#39;ve ever seen. I would appreciate knowing if anyone else in the area observed them and if indded there was an exercise taking place on the test range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date indicated by witness may be flawed.  We suspect witness intended to indicate August 27, not August 28, and we have amended the date above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, se believe that some type of pyrotechnic device being used over the BMG/Gila Bend Firing Range would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witness observed something unusual.  However, the witness seems to rule out that possibility, and we recognize that flares usually give off a smokey trail, which is visible, and the witness correctly reports.  Please see somewhat similar report from Mesa, AZ, for the same date at 20:45 hrs..  If the events are the same, the data from the two reports could be used to triangulate on the location of the lights.  PD))<n>

I noticed what I first thought was a flashing star, but then I saw it was moving across the sky from the west to the east.While watching that one I began to see others like it moving from the west to the east, but then after about 20 minutes a few of them moved back from the east to the west.  At this point I called my mother and cousin who drove over.  I meanwhile also got my binoculars out and went back outside to get a closer look.  Then I noticed higher up in the sky 2 stationary circular blinking objets.  As I caught sight of the traveling ones again I could now see that they were reddish flashing lights and they had a triangular shape.  Mostly they traveled in one direction but a few times they zigzagged across the sky.  By 10:45p.m. we came inside so I am not sure how much longer they were out there.<n>

However, there was a helicopter that was in the vicinity we thought the object had been in. (and the video store didn&#39;t even carry that movie!)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see second similar report from Maricopa, AZ, for the same date at 21:45 hrs..

It was crossing over the road i was passing it look like three lights like a triange and it was too slow  no noise coming from the UFO. It took apx 30-45 sec to go and then lights disappear. So it can&#39;t be the plane. When i open my window look it was changing light location from triangle to 120 degree angle ligts when passed. Same vinicity in few minutes aircraft passed same route and it made noice as well it passed pretty fast crossed the road i was on in 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates the date of his sighting is approximate, even though it allegedly had occurred on the same date that he submitted the report.

I also scanned the n/w quadrant of the sky to see if the winking light would make a reapparance.   (It should be noted that on several evenings since our first sighting, my wife and I have gone outside to see about a repeat performance with no luck.)  I had been looking at the sky for several minutes when I thought I saw something flash directly above me in the sky.  This was out of my peripheral vision, so I focused on the area above me where I had seen the flash.  I did a mental count to 29 (as in the first sighting), and on the count of 29 was looking directly at the flash as it winked on and winked off.  The flash was white in color, just to the &#34;top&#34; of the northern cross (i.e., if the cross were right-side up, the flash was located above the top of the cross), and the brightness was equal to that of nearby Vega, if not brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I dashed inside, grabbed the video camera, and called to my wife, &#34;It&#39;s back.&#34;  I went back outside, grabbed a lawn chair and sat down, and looked up again in the sky.  As my wife came out, we saw it flash once more, very bright.  I started up my video camera and aimed it at the location in the sky and waited in vain.  It did not reappear.  My wife saw the second flash.  From its location against the stars, it appeared to be traveling in a generally east to west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 20:22, we saw another white flash, this time in a different location, further north in the night sky; just behind the back of Cassiopeia&#39;s chair.  We focused on that area and began our mental count to 29.  But only a few seconds after this new flash, we saw a second flash, which was also behind Cassiopeia&#39;s chair, but a few degrees west of the first flash.  That was all.  We watched the skies for almost an hour more with no luck.  We did see several shooting stars, airplanes and satellites.  They are all quite different from the flashing light we observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are acquainted with these witnesses, and we know them to be quite reliable, and credible as witnesses.  If they are not observing the intermittent flashes of a tumbling rocket booster shell in orbit, then we do not know what it is they are observing.  NUFORC has received several reports during August 2003 of seemingly unexplained &#34;winking&#34; lights in the night sky.

It was the night that Mars was closest to the earth and I was staying at my son &amp; daughter-in-laws apartment on top of a mountain that was a rock quarry off of Camp Creek Rd., Springfield, OR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son asked his wife this night if she had seen ‘Mars’ and she said no, so all 3 of us went out of the apartment (it was attached on the end of a very large metal shop building) and as we walked outside there was a Very Bright Light, my son said “see there it is” and I said to him,,, “No, that is not Mars, it is more to the Southeast, but I don’t know what that ‘bright light is’…..<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got to the end of the building there to the South was ‘Mars’, and we looked at it and then at the ‘Bright Light’, that looked like a Star,,,, we all walked out to the clearing on the top of the mountain and was looking at this ‘Light’, and all of a sudden it went Vertically UP… not far from what one would estimate in ‘height’ but then I got the distinct feeling it was coming right at us…..”I yelled to my Son and his wife “get back to the apartment quick”, my son said as he was running he was going to get his camera and being 6’3” 195 of solid muscle ran quickly to his pick-up and grabbed his camera and ran to the apartment door where his wife and I were (there was a little cover built over the doorway),,,<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son looked up and tried to use his camera (which he used every day for work but it would not work) as we all looked up “There was this Beautiful Object just above the tree tops that had the most Amazing Lights I had ever seen in my life”, I kept saying…. “Wow,,,, look at those lights, they are beautiful”, and my daughter-in-law wanted to run out under the object and I held her back and told her “NO…. You can’t go out there, haven’t you seen the movie “Fire in the Sky”????  She said NO, and even though I didn’t know what we were looking at…. In my subconscious mind I knew it was not something to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object only stayed above us for a minute maybe two… but as fast as we ‘blinked our eyes it was gone’!!!  We ran to the other end of the building and could find no trace of where it had gone….. I told my daughter about it the next day and she told me she was listening to CNN that morning and a couple reported seeing a ‘bright object that looked like a star in the sky that same night we did and it came towards them as well’…. I tried to contact CNN to get information about the couple but never got a response.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This really did happen and after we went inside, my son stated that “we just saw a UFO”, it was like we were mesmerized when it was above us, but we lost no ‘time’ in this encounter and none of us have had nightmares or dreams that have frightened us so I do not believe there was any encounter with whoever was in the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This actually did happen to all 3 of us and I am grateful no ‘encounter’ happened to us or that we were subjected to any abduction from ‘them’!<n>

Just then I noticed a brief flash of light in the area of (after checking the star charts) the constelation Cephius. The first flash lasted about as long as what the strobe lights on an aircraft do, but then didn&#39;t continue to flash, but I kept watching. About 20-25 seconds later another flash that seemed to be fainter and slightly to the NE of where it flashed previously, and again a long pause of 20-25 sec and another fainter flash even fainter as if it were leaving the Earths atmosphere. The initial flash had 2 lights very close together, but after the 3rd flash I couldn&#39;t determine there to be seperate lights. I saw a total of 4 flashes and by the time of the 4th, it was just a barely noticeable dot and had I not known where to be looking would have never noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We wonder whether the witness might have observed a tumbling booster rocket shell in orbit.  Absent that possibility, we do not know what was observed.  PD))<n>

She didn&#39;t pay any attention to it coming home so we went outside on the balcony to look at it. Just as we were looking at Mars a triangular or V-shaped object appeared from the southwest sky and moved towards the northeast. It was a dark gray color, which made it visible in the sky. It wasn&#39;t a smooth object but seemed like it had a rough and textured exterior. She asked me if &#34;I see that,&#34; and I said, &#34;Yes.&#34; She asked me &#34;What it was,&#34; and &#34;Is that a bird,&#34; I stated &#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; and we watched it move across the sky. It made no sound and had no movement except across the sky. The entire sighting lasted 10-15 seconds at which point it disappeared out of view behind a building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, we kept asking each other what it was. If it was a plane it would have had lights (it didn&#39;t) and made some noise. If it was a bird or a flock of birds such as geese it would have had movement and possibly made noise. It did neither. I thought to myself that it could be a satellite but it was too low. I do not believe in UFO&#39;s but my girlfriend does. So my only conclusion is a government test plane. But I can not get over the fact that if it was a test plane, why would they fly it over a populated area when people are sure to be looking up at Mars? So I decided to post this to see if anybody else happened to see the same thing.<n>

It was facing south and from my direction I didn&#39;t need to tilt my head up to the sky, it was near where mars was at this point and about 5 inches to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad called me out around 11:50 pm and it ended at 12:35. It was a cloudy night and underneath the clouds was this light that shone through and it kept doing this tiny orbit. It just kept going and going and at first it was the same tiny orbit but as time went on the course would change slightly and it got bigger and bigger and it seemed that towards the end another object joined the course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It couldn&#39;t have been a light from earth because there was no stream of light and where there was no cloud you couldn&#39;t see anything, But where there was a thick cloud cover you couldn&#39;t see anything either so if there were a light it would show.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the past week my dad would see lights going from south to east in a line and then all of a sudden stopping and then shooting straight up and disappearing. These lights  would travel across the sky quickly. They weren&#39;t blinking or anything, I guess kind of... like a moving star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok thanks.

The witness told me what her family member did see was certainly a jet. All of a sudden the witness saw what she thought was a shooting star just to the north of the jet but a lot higher up. She says it started out like a shooting star but then there was a flash of white light and then it happened again approx: 20 seconds later and another flash. They both stood wondering if this may have been another jet as this one was going in a northwesterly direction. But as the witness watched she mentioned that the intervals weren&#39;t the same as a jet airliner. (meaning the flashing of the jets lights). It then disappeared and then in another 20 to 30 seconds there was another flash of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness says this is where it gets a bit odd and figured it wasn&#39;t another jet that she was aware of. Thinking maybe it was something the military was flying overhead. She saw a flash in front of the object and it reminded her of a laser light. She also said you could see the light zapping a good distance in front of the object.

We decided to move around the house to the northside where we could just skywatch for awhile longer. From this vantage point, away from the dusk to dawn light, we could see the Milky Way and some of the constellations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the distance was a bank of clouds and heat lightning. About half the sky was clearly visible to us and the moon had not risen. There was no wind blowing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of this sighting, I had turned my gaze to the west and was looking for meteors, when my family member exclaimed, &#34;WHAT is THAT?&#34;. When I turned around, she was pointing to a spot just in front of us and high up. At that time, I saw nothing but stars. She went on to say, &#34;There was a bright flash of  light and then it went out.&#34;  As I kept searching the area she was pointing in, she continued, &#34;It didn&#39;t have any blinking lights.&#34;(referring to navigational lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I didn&#39;t have my watch on at that time, I would have to guess that it was approximately 20 seconds from the first time she spotted the light until I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to blink on again almost in the same location she had been pointing out to me. In a spot where nothing had been visible previously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time, the light had a definite circular shape and slightly blue. Not the bright white flash she first saw. It was on for a split second and then went out. I ran into the house to get the binoculars and check the time.

As I was still traveling about 10 mph at that time, the object was no longer visible once it was low enough on the horizon.  The really strange thing was that after a few minutes I overheard Mr. KABC start talking about objects he had been seeing every day on his way to work in the past several days.  Was this a coincidence or what?!?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see a second report of apparently the same event, as seen from Poway, CA.  Possible meteor, we believe.  PD))<n>

Then, I saw an egg shaped object moving quickly across the sky from West to East.  It was unlit, but appeared to be reflecting light from another source.  It covered approximately a 90 degree arc in eight seconds or less.  I tried to point it out to others standing with me, but nobody else picked it out.  One fellow said it must have been an Iridium Satellite because they travel in a &#34;low earth orbit&#34;, but I dismissed that as there was some high cirrus clouds and the object appeared to be travelling below these clouds.  I have heard no other reports of any unidentified objects.  There was no sound associated with this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  There were no overflights of the International Space Station during on this date, and on several days either side of the date indicated above by the witness, so that possibility can be ruled out.  In addition, a man-made satellite would not cover 90 degrees of arc in 8 seconds, including  Iridium satellites, which would not &#34;flare&#34; for that length of time.  The event seems incompatible with any conventional event that we can think of.  PD))<n>

Orlando, Florida.  I was standing outside of my garage at my apartment complex.  After working on my motorcycle I went to the front of the building and was standing by my people mover (my car), took a deep breath and gazed off into the distant sky viewing the stars above.  I was looking to the north at two stars, one a little brighter then the other.  I noticed that the brighter star seemed to be moving/dropping below and to the left of the dimmer star; the brighter star was as still as the dimmer one before it started moving.  I thought my head was spinning so I looked down and looked back to see if it was me.  It was not, the moving star/object continued to move downward, then the star/object got very bright, a very bright white with a hint of blue, it became brighter then any other star in the sky.  The star/object moved towards the north and faded out of sight, not at an extremly fast rate but at a faster rate then any airplane I have ever seen, and it was at a very high altitude.  I had to stop and ask myself, what did I just witness.  I started laughing and told myself, no that was the after burner of a military jet, then I looked towards the NE and saw a second very bright star, and the same event happen but this one seemed closer to the horizon and closer towards me.  It became brighter then the first one, again a very bright white, it moved off towards the NE.  I am very sure that what I saw was not a military jet. What I saw moved unlike any plane I have ever seen and I have seen most if not all of them as my father was in the AirForce for twenty five years and so we always saw the jets in action.  I really hope that someone else had witnessed the same event that I had. I am a 44 year old male stable and sober, self employed father of three, just moved to the Orlando, FLorida area.  If anyone had seen the same events as I witnessed, please e-mail me at ((e-address deleted))<n>

The sky was very clear and many stars were visible over the ocean horizon. There was a slight haze over the water that obscured the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat on the beach watching the sky, there appeared a bright stationary light with a orange huge high in the sky. It was as intense as Mars and for a moment looked as though there were 2 Mars. The light persisted for several seconds and winked out. We continued to watch and the light appeared again in a different location, it appeared first on the left of Mars and then on the right and slightly lower in the sky. Again the light appeared and blinked out after 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were really excited as this was like nothing we had ever seen before, it changed position but not in a straight path.  After about 20 mins. 2 lights appeared together to the left of Mars both appeared and winked out after about 2 seconds. The last sighting was to the right of Mars and low on the horizon, the light was partially obscured by the layer of haze and shone more red in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed Mars for several more nights and looked for the lights, they did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was quite and what aircraft traffic was in the sky was clearly visible. One thought I had was that the lights might be the afterburners on some military aircraft out over the ocean. I have never observed them at night and do not know how they would appear. I mention this because there is a military base near by and I did see 2 F-16’s earlier that day. They were very load and flew out over the ocean. The lights we saw were stationary and we heard no aircraft noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed, but we believe one possibility to explore would be landing lights on approaching commercial or military aircraft.  Just a guess on our part.  PD))<n>
8/26/03 20:10|Hsin Hse Town (Taiwan)|||10 seconds|50 or so small lights flying in formation from NNE to SSW|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30936.html|161|ndxe200308| 50 or so small lights flying in formation from NNE to SSW<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my roof watching the nightsky what I often do. I clearly know the diference between a star, planet, airplane or satelite. Then suddenly I saw many lights approaching from the NNE and moving in straight line to the SSW. I could only see them in the darker part above me because the lower horizons were too polluted by residential lighting. The only thing I saw were lights, I didn&#39;t see any shape that connected them. The amount of lights were somewhere between 40 and 70. The majority was shaped in a V-shape. Outside this V-shape there were also a few that formed a straight line. Then there were a few seemingly randomly spreaded around. There was no sound, also not after they had dissappeared for 5 minutes. The lights were white and if not for the moving they seemed just like stars. All the lights (V-shape, straight line and the randomly spreaded) didn&#39;t move relatively to each other. It seemed they were flying in formation. At first I thought they were many single objects. The next morning I realized that they could have been the lights of a single object. Because I don&#39;t have any clue of how far the lights were I also cannot say anything about the size of the object. If they were all connected the total shape was much larger then an airplane used for intercity flightsthat usually flies at 3 to 4 km height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I&#39;m 100% conviced that this is pure coincidence the following is worth mentioning: After the lights dissapeared over the SSW there also entered a local airplane from the NNE which headed in the direction of W where the local airport of Taichung city is. This is quite normal because every 10 or 15 minutes one can spot one. Again the lights and the airplane were not observed at the same time. The airplane showed up after the lights had dissappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To make sure I was not dreaming, I took a few steps forward and then moved to the other side of the patio. The object was clearly visible in the bright sunlight at an altitude of a low flying small aircraft - like a PIPER or CESSNA. The object was smaller than a small aircraft but shining brightly indicating its metallic surface or something shiny on its surface reflecting the bright sunlight. The object was moving West to East at a moderate speed. The object was definitely NOT A PLANE OF ANY KNOWN COMMERCIAL SHAPE OR MAKE. IT WAS NOT A BALLON OR KITE OR A BIRD. IT WAS AN OBJECT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then ran in and called my wife. By the time she could come out, the object was out view - there was a big tree right outside our patio blocking the view. I grabbed a camera and ran outside to take a picture. It was too late. The object was gone. I looked all around in the sky, it was not to be seen. There were some larger trees, and it is possible my sight of the object could have been blocked by those trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is interesting is that the object had suddenly appeared in my view from nowhere. Though I was standing in the patio, looking at the sky and enjoying the beautiful summer day for at least five minutes before the object appeared, I did not see it until it was quite late. AND THERE WAS NO SOUND COMING FROM THE OBJECT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not discussed this with anyone nor do I plan to discuss this with anyone. I  want to remain anonymous and hence I am not providing my correct name or contact information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information.

There were dark clouds gathered and they seem to be moving. I guess it was because it was going to rain soon, although it was kinda weird that the clouds were dark since it was a very sunny day. I was wearing my sunglasses and squinting at the Sun. Then I saw this Moon-like object high up in the clouds, about an inch away from the Sun (from my position). It looked like the Moon, or a planet, only it&#39;s a little bigger then the Moon when it&#39;s full. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing because this was during the afternoon, about 2-3+pm. At first I thought it might be the Moon but how could the Moon and the Sun be in the sky next to each other at the same time? I told my friend to look up and she saw it too, she thought it was the Moon but that&#39;s impossible. It wasn&#39;t as bright as the Sun, it looked disc-like, I even saw some dark patches on it, kinda like the Moon with its craters. on it.  What&#39;s even more surprising is that this &#39;Moon&#39; was moving. I couldn&#39;t remember which direction, but I think it was revolving around the Sun. At the same time the dark clouds were moving pass it, sort of like it was trying to hide the appearance of this object. Every few momens I would stare at it again to make sure it was still there and not a trick of the eye. I was holding the life of a kid in my hands since I was belaying. Wouldn&#39;t be too good if I had to explain why I was careless enough to let a kid drop 15 feet to his death. Haha. Ok back to the topic. After a while, the object moved towards the sun, at a very high speed I guess, from the ground it looked like it was moving 1 cm a second, but multiply it by the distance this object is away from us, I think that&#39;s a very high speed. And moments later, the object seemed to merged with the Sun, sort of like an eclispe, except without the Sun darkening or whatever.<n>

Some, but not all of the computers in the department shut down, some just flickered and remained on as did the lights.  Approximately 2 or 3 seconds after that another more powerful surge flowed through, and this time I actually pysically felt it, and this time it shut down the rest of the computers but the lights remained on.  I walked over to my collogues office, which is on a window side of our building facing south, about two cubical down from me, and half jokingly mused about another black out.  Then I noticed the expression on his face as he looked at me, his mouth and eyes wide.  He said &#34;it was like something passed in front of the sun, like someone or something walked by the window and blocked out the sun, a giant shadow!&#34;  But as he said this to me, he was waving is right hand past his his head as if indicating that something had taken a path through the window and past by him. The stange thing is that when the first surge began, my sense was that the light just above his cubical was the area that was &#34;hit&#34;, sort of the hot spot. I wonder if anyone else in the Billerica, Chemsford, Ma. area experienced anything unusal.  What ever my co-worker was describing had to be huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I was outside talking to my brother as I noticed three &gt; triangular stars moving across the sky, I had to look &gt; again to make sure, I said &#34;look a triangle ufo!&#34; my &gt; brother and I both agreed to see if it was one solid &gt; craft or three independent ufo&#39;s, we did this by &gt; waiting for the triangle to pass over some stars, but &gt; when it did we seen the stars through the triangle and &gt; knew it was not one craft but three seperate objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;  also, even though the three objects kept the triangle &gt; formation as it flew from a south west direction to a &gt; north east direction the triangle formation did not &gt; keep true form but shifted out of place somewhat, so &gt; now we knew the objects did not all travel at constant &gt; speeds but varying speeds due to minor formation &gt; breakup.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;    after 2-3 minutes I went to my moms bedroom window &gt; and pounded on it for her to wake up! she came outside &gt; and also witnessed these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;    I seen tumbling satelites that flash randomly as &gt; they reflect sunlight, I also witnessed low earth &gt; orbit repositioning satelites, and satelites that &gt; flare out due to sunlight reflection, and military &gt; flares,landing lights on planes,meteors,falling &gt; stars,northern lights,space station and shuttle flying &gt; at same time, ect...<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;    I guess the best way to describe this is three &gt; satelites flying (20,000 mph) in space in triangle &gt; formation with one or two changing speed, but after &gt; approx. 3-5 minutes of viewing phenomonem, triangle &gt; formation remained intact, and none of the objects &gt; passed the other, unlike satelites which keep constant &gt; speed unless they reposition their course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at the formation of three satellites which are often reported to us, and which are thought to be U.

I was sitting at Craig airport waiting on a cargo plane and suddenly noticed a glowing object out of the corner of my eye. It had a triangle shape to it and was sitting about 800 to 1000 feet up in the sky at the north east edge of the airfield. As I watched it it began to change from its original triangle shape to a half circle then split into two smaller ovals and then fade out as if they had a dimmer switch. I sit at this airfield M-F every week for the past two years meeting planes and know this was no airplane. This was to say the least a very strange sight and have not seen it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We, at first, thought that the witness might have observed a missile launch out of Cape Canaveral, perhaps the launch of a Titan-4-B at 00:29 hrs. on September 12, 2003.  However, Jacksonville, FL, is to the north of Cape Canaveral, and any launch would have been visible in the southern sky, from the vantage point of the witness.  PD))<n>

When I saw 3 round lights in the sky.  Within another second or so later I saw 30 lights in row forming a half circle.  The light was pretty big, it looks like it&#39;s about 4 or 5 feet in diameter.  The light was an orange bronze color.  You could see it clearly, but it wasn&#39;t bright.  I thought it was an airplane flying very low, but I was wrong. As I got closer to the light I could see the circle shape spinning counter clock wise while the lights are taking turn diming in sequence. The object was facing down at about a 30 degrees angle. The flying object looks like it&#39;s about the size of a Wal-mart supercenter. That night while I was driving, I got my windows down to enjoy the nice cool weather. As I saw the object with my eyes, I tried to listen if the object have any sound, but I didn&#39;t hear anything from it.  It was just hoovering in the sky. I was going to follow it, but it disapper as fast as it appeared.  The whole incident lasted for about 30 or 40 seconds. The sight where I saw it is normally busy with traffic during the day, but at night, it&#39;s really dead. I was the only car out there when I saw the object. I never seen anything like it in my life, and it&#39;s still kind of hard to believe what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;ve grown accustomed to seeing various aircraft in my area, as I live about 2-3 miles from an airport, so most air traffic crosses over my house, but it usually comes from the East when flying low, as that is the direction the airport is from me.  This craft came from the South...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying very low, just above my roof and the treetops nearby, traveling at a reasonably fast pace, but just slow enough over me to where I could stand in awe wondering what it was and memorize its every detail in passing.  Each corner of the triangle had a very bright light that was like a spotlight shining down on the ground, and each light was equal in brightness.  It wasn&#39;t completely quiet, yet it wasnt&#39; very loud either.  The noise it made was sort of soft humming sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed it when I saw the bright lights coming over my roof as I was laying in the hammock in my backyard looking up to the sky towards Mars.  The lights were really bright and at first in the distance I thought it was a Police Helicopter spotlighting for a criminal or something, but it wasn&#39;t loud enough to be a helicopter so I thought it odd.  It came quickly over my roof, covering about a mile in a few seconds.  When it was over my back yard area, it slowed down quite a bit.  The 3 lights shined down into my backyard and then after it passed by it sped up again and took off so fast I couldn&#39;t see it anymore in a matter of seconds, due North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing it, I thought it must be some hi-tech jet of some sort, but after looking for about an hour online thru various pictures of jets and planes, I saw nothing close to it.  Then I did a search on U.F.O.  and found a site that had drawings of a craft that looked EXACTLY like what I saw!  Then I came to this site today and decided to report what I saw last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still amazed by what I saw... I don&#39;t know if this was something top secret, millitary, or something not of this world, but whatever the case, it was a phenomenal sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a drawing I made of the craft available if you are interested in seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was at 5500 ft above the ground, cruising at 145 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just taken off from Gila Bend, when from out of nowhere a somewhat big craft of some kind flew right in front of me, approx 50 yards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  instantly turned to my left and reported it to ATC, who told me they had nothing on their radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the few seconds I was directly behind it, I should have been in some kind of turbulence, but instead the flight got even smoother.  I also noticed my ADF CDI started malfunctioning, the needle started pointing directly at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft flew along my right wing occasionaly increasing speed dramatically to possibly 300 knots, and changing its altitude.  It appeared to be getting closer to me at one point, and instead of backing away like I should have, I kept my current course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It must have been about 100 ft away, and I noticed what I thought was the front. I saw no lights on it, the only reason I could see it at all was because of the glow of Phoenix in the background 40 miles away. after exactly 16 min and watching it pretty closely it made a sudden move farther from my course and a rappid increase in speed and a slight climb and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted Phoenix Sky Harbour, and told them what I saw and that it appeared to be entering their airspace. They also told me they had nothing on radar.<n>

Very light patches of cloud cover but mostly a good clear view of stars. I was looking toward the north and I caught site of what I thought was a shooting star traveling southwest to northeast. When I first observed the UFO it was directly overhead heading towards the northeast. It was a triangle shape with red lights on each point of the triangle. They were not flashing or very bright, just a constant red glow that defined the very distinct black triangle shape. The was no noise whatsoever. The speed would be compared to a shooting star. I was only able to view the object for a few seconds because of the extreme speed it cross the sky. The only thing I am not clear about is if it rotated slightly, not spinning but a slight rotation. My impression is controled flight. I do not know the size because I have no reference, but I felt I was at a very high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a professional observer, however I know what a plane and helicopter look like, I have seen satelites many times. I have even seen the space shuttle when it was docking with the space station. I thought possibly it might be a military fighter but because of the speed, shape and absence of any noise leads me to believe otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both noticed a shape travelling North east to South West across the sky at the same time.  We could not see the shape of the object all I could see was a series of lights arranged in a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be flying as fast as a normal plane and was fairly high in the sky as it dissapeared over the clouds.  I thought I could hear the drone of a distant engine although my friend said it was silent. We watched it until it went out of view, it was heading out of Southampton and across the English Channel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am completely sane and have not seen anything like this before, nor do I believe in UFO&#39;s.  Did anyone else seen this over the UK?  Could it be some kind of special military plane?<n>

When first observed, there were three lights in-line.  We will refer to that position as 1200.  They were travelling at what appeard to be very high speed, and in a south/east direction. There was no sound assoicated with the view.  At approximately the 1:00 position, the lights went into a triagular position, with 1 followed by 2.  They changed position very quickly.  At approximatly the 1:30 position, they again went into an in-line position, and just as quicly were once again into a triangle position.  The changing of formation contined until they were about 45 degrees from straight obove me.  The lights grew dimmer as appeard to get further away, until they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would just like to know if anyone else observed these lights on this evening.  Please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness composed the report on August 25, indicating a sighting on August 28th.  We have asked for the correct date, and we have arbitrarily assigned a date of August 25th, until we hear back from the witness.  PD))<n>

8/25/03 14:25|Lompoc|CA|Disk|5 minutes|A shiny, tumbling disk was seen moving slowly to the southeast.|9/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31281.html|175|ndxe200308| A shiny, tumbling disk was seen moving slowly to the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just heading out of town (Lompoc, CA, USA) on an overnight trip. I was driving S/E on Highway 1, when I noticed a flashing out of the corner of my eye. I looked out the driver&#39;s side window on my left, and noticed a strange disk like object that seemed to be tumbling. The flashing seemed to be from the object reflecting sunlight as it tumbled. I immediately pulled my car over to the side of the road, at the point where Jalama Beach road intersects Highway 1. This is about 8 miles S/E of Lompoc. Vandenburg air force base is about 10 miles to the west of this sighting, and extends to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object eventually disappeared behind a mountain ridge, the ridge being about 1 mile S/E from my location, and perhaps 1000 feet above my vantage point. I was able to watch this object for about 5 minutes; which gave me enough time to mentally record some facts, which I&#39;ll list here:  Time: 2:25pm, August 25, 2003  Weather: fair and sunny, warm, no clouds. Wind (at ground level) was calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Direction: object was N/E of me, moving S/E, parallel to Highway 1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Motion: object was moving slowly, possibly drifting in an upper level wind (wind was calm at ground level); moving away from Lompoc, in the general direction of Gaviota or Santa Barbara. The object never changed direction, or speed. It crossed perhaps 90 degrees of open sky over the course of 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size: object seemed about 1/16 inch in diameter, viewed at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance: object was greater than one mile away(see above).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: object was disk shaped, with a shiny, chrome-like upper side, and a dark,  gray or black, non-reflective bottom. The shape was similar to a coin. The flashing I noticed was due to the top side reflecting sunlight as the object &#34;tumbled.&#34; No features were visible on the disk itself. The object was completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tumbling motion: at first glance, this object seemed to be slowly tumbling as it drifted to the S/E. As I looked more carefully, I noticed that the chrome-like top side remained the top side throughout each &#34;tumble.&#34; Perhaps &#34;extreme yawing and pitching&#34; would be a better term than &#34;tumble,&#34; with the disk as much as 80 degrees from horizontal at maximum. This &#34;pitching&#34; had a very regular periodicity, lasting about 2 or 3 seconds before repeating. This allowed me to see both the top(chrome-like); and bottom(dark); sides of the object, as well as its&#39; thin cross section, when seen from the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though the object was too far away to be sure, I strongly suspect that the actual motion of the object was a &#34;rotational precession.&#34; This is similar to what a spinning coin would do as it slowly comes to rest on the surface of a table. And like a tabletop coin, this would indicate that an upward force was acting on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was far enough away to make a positive ID difficult(A pair of binoculars would have been perfect, but I didn&#39;t have any). Still, as I watched, I mentally went through a list of what it wasn&#39;t. It definitely wasn&#39;t: an airplane, a hot-air balloon, a helicopter, a rocket launch (I&#39;ve seen many from Vandenburg), a piece of mylar scrap, a blimp, or an advertising balloon. It was also flying fairly low over private ranchland, which would make a vehicle of government origin, less likely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only rational explanation I could think of was a child&#39;s mylar balloon, drifting in an upper level wind. However, a balloon of this type would be far too small for the distance this object was at. They&#39;re also too &#34;fat.&#34; This object was thin, like a coin. When the object was viewed edge on, it practically disappeared, with only a thin line visible. Also, remember the tumbling? A drifting balloon will remain motionless(no tumbling), as it slowly glides over the ground, since it would be in equilibrium with the prevailing air currents. Was the tumbling then caused by thermals? Probably not, since there was no altitude change, and the motion of the tumbling was quite regular(periodic). I decided, while still watching this object, that the balloon scenario was extremely unlikely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched this UFO database and noticed three other similar cases, oddly enough, all from this general area, one in Laguna Niguel(5/11/2003), one in Goleta(also 5/11/2003), and one in Santa Barbara(8/24/03, one day prior to my sighting). Laguna Niguel is about 150 miles S/E of here, Goleta and Santa Barbara are just down the road, S/E about 30 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also of note: when viewed on a map, the direction this object was heading was exactly parallel to the Pacific coast, albeit 10 miles inland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About me: I&#39;m male, 39, 20/20 vision. I have a strong science/math background, and currently work as a teaching substitue at the local high school. I have some flight experience, having once trained as a naval aviator. I&#39;ve also studied UFO cases for many years, though I prefer to stick with cases involving policeman, military, or pilots. I never expected to see one for myself , though.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My partner and I watched on a hot, cloudy day, as a square object (kind of like a mortar board) tumbled (or flipped as I would have originally described it) along at a steady pace, slowly, under cloud level.  It appeared to be very small, and again, I can see the similarity to the Basingstoke sighting, as we at first thought it could be a &#39;balloon&#39;.  However, it flipped or rotated slowly and evenly, in a perfectly straight line for quite a distance until we couldn&#39;t see it.  If it were a balloon it would have changed course at least once, or showed some kind of alternate movement, but it didn&#39;t sway from its course once.  I tried to zoom in on it using the my camcorder, but alas, it was too small to get a good focus on.  I&#39;d like to hear about anything similar, obviously, something a little different was spanning the skies on these dates from the Midlands to the South at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The triangular shape was distinct. The edges of the object were illuminated by a red band of individual lights. The lights did not flash. The object appeared to be either hovering or making a slow movement to the southwest in my direction. It was probably 15 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered stopping for a better look, or making a call to the sheriff or a radio station, but I did not have time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving to work on Interstate 71, I tried to locate the object, but I could not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weird thing was that when I pulled into the parking lot at work (in the Polaris area of Columbus) at about 5:00 AM, I again saw the same triangle in the eastern sky, this time at a much higher elevation, probably 45 degrees above the horizon. It was probably four miles to the east. After looking at it for a few seconds, it seemed to fade away into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got into my car at 4:40 AM, I saw nothing unusual. But the distance at which I saw it would have put it very near my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am hoping that there are other eyewitnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/25/03 03:45|South Daytona Beach|FL|Light|5-8 seconds|Three haloed lights, which appeared to be close, flying in a V formation, with no sound and at great speed.|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30932.html|178|ndxe200308| Three haloed lights, which appeared to be close, flying in a V formation, with no sound and at great speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been sitting on my hotel room balcony approximately 30 mins., being unable to sleep, when 3 lights &#34;appeared&#34; slightly to my left moving up the beach, south to north.  I did not see them coming from down the beach, they were just &#34;there&#34;.  They did not appear to be high in the sky, but only slightly higher than my balcony which was on the 5th floor.  They were moving very quickly and with absolutely no sound.  They were in a V formation and in perfect unison.  It was very quick but I jumped up to watch as long as possible but they disappeared shortly past me, into what appeared to be a haze, though it was a clear night as I could see the stars in the sky clearly.  What confused me was that I had the feeling that I was focusing on something just out from me, and not far away, or &#34;in the sky&#34;.  Though, the fact that it was only lights, with a bit of a halo or hazy appearance and no sound, makes me believe they had to be far away.  I had been looking at the stars, a couple of planes high in the sky, the surf breaking on the beach, and lighted boats far out in the water......so my focus on these lights seemed close at hand.  If they were close the speed would make sense though the lack of sound, doesn&#39;t. If they were far away, the speed presents a troubling factor.  This &#39;sighting&#39; and the unscientific &#39;feeling&#39; that I was viewing something extraordinary, has caused rumination.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was sitting near the window and staring at the lights outside. It was a bit cloudy. I was amazed to see light yellow light in the clouds. When i looked down i saw some lights far off from the train. Lights were glowing as though they were on the outer side of a disk. First i thought it must be a cricket stadium or some flyover but when i observed the lights for over half an hour i was shocked as those lights didn&#39;t change their position as my train was moving at a speed of over 60Kms per hour. I continued to stare at the lights till 1:00 for over 50 minutes when they were obstructed by the city buildings. There was no flash coming from them . they were dim just like stars and their position was stationary relative to my train (just like stars) which made me believe that its something not on the ground but in the sky. There were 2 symmetrical patterns of lights as though there are 2 disks . It might have been a spy plane or something but in that case , it should have changed its position when my train stopped at a station for over 10 minutes . But this didn&#39;t happen. When my train started again, the lights were still at the same position.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a bright ruby-red light that hovered in one area in the northern sky of Los Angeles.  It seemed to pulse slowly then more quickly and finally disappear.  I saw it twice in the same spot to the north.  I didn&#39;t see it move at all, it just hovered, then pulsed and then disappeared.  I called the satellite office of Griffith Observatory once to report it (they gave me the same story that I was looking at Mars).  I called the second time to see if anyone else had reported this, again they said no, I then asked them to log my call in case any one else called in and to keep an eye out in the northern skies.  The second time was the last I saw of this light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m thinking this was some sort of laser coming from the Mount Wilson area scanning the sky, maybe even conducting some tests due to the fact Mars was so close to Earth.  I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just my theory.  The more exposure we can get on this the better chances we have of figuring out what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another interesting fact I  have noticed is that most if not all sightings were from the San Gabriel valley area (I also was in that area), more specifically Monterey Park and Montebello.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports of a sighting of a red light seen hovering over the area east of downtown Los Angeles.

It got bright over Thornhill before going less bright going your direction. I believe it was no plane, meteorite or satellite as it did look really strange. The sky was  +- 30 % overcast. No sound was heard coming from the light/object. Color change was like so many times before..just kind of going bright and going more dim afterwards. No stops, no hovering. Nothing strange regarding behavior and I would say it was +- 10-30 m in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

Shasta<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three or four lights appeared to play leapfrog.  At any given moment there were three  stationary lights in the sky, however, as one light went out another light would instantly reappear just opposite the two remaining lights.  I would estimate that the lights were about 20 to 30 yards apart from one another.  The sequence occurred about five times for a period of about 10 seconds.  It was a moonless night with the only nearby town far in the distance.  The lights appeared to be less than two miles away and fairly near to the hilly horizon.  On this night the lights were brighter than Mars and about the same color of yellow.  We waited approximately 30 minutes and another event of the same phenomenon occurred in a distant location.  This second occurrence was higher in the sky and at a different angle to the first.  The leapfrog event continued about 5 times for a period of about 10 seconds.  We were camping on the eastern slope of Mt. Shasta at an elevation of about 8000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a trained medical professional.

8/24/03 16:00|Monroe|WA|Fireball|5 seconds|Massive low altitude fireball speeding north over the horizon above Monroe, WA, at 16:00 on 8/24/03.|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31200.html|192|ndxe200308| Massive low altitude fireball speeding north over the horizon above Monroe, WA, at 16:00 on 8/24/03.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on Hwy. 522 eastbound, facing a north direction in this particular segment of the highway, heading from Seattle to Monroe.  I was about 10-15 miles outside of Monroe heading into Monroe.  There is a couple of stoplights at this point on 522 that is famous for traffic backing up, and I was approaching one of these stoplights around 4pm or so, slowing down, when I witnessed the sighting.  At first glance, I thought it was a shooting star (thinking to myself, &#39;but in the middle of the day, so visible?)  when I quickly realized that instead of streaking across the sky in the upper atmosphere, this was much closer, as low you might expect a small airplane to be that was starting a landing approach (5-10k feet?).  It was a massive fireball, a large burning mass followed be a long tail of fiery debris burning off. It was falling to the earth, and lasted only several seconds before it dissapeared over the trees on the horizon.  This highway is well wooded in this area, almost a path or corridor cut into the forest, and anything moving in the sky would dissapear out of your line of sight beyond the trees on either side, unless the object was heading the same direction as the highway, in which case you&#39;d be able to see it longer until it disappeared over the horizon ahead beyond the trees rather than either side of the highway&#39;s close forested sides. this object&#39;s falling path did indeed follow the corridor of sight of the highway stretching out ahead of me, until disappeared over the treetops of the horizon. So I got a good 5 second look at it, luckily as it traveled the same direction overhead of the stretch of highway I was on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Were I not in a car, I probably would&#39;ve seen it much longer from behind me as well, as opposed to just when it just got ahead of me and cleared into the view of my windshield.  From my vantage point, as it streaked and fell and disappeared beyond the trees on the horizon, the trajectory to me looked like it was falling only 10-15 miles ahead of me, like in dowtown Monroe!  In retrospect however, given my untrained eye, what looked like falling in front of me could&#39;ve really been a much flatter slope and just streaking across horizontally out in front of me, and really hitting earth 100 miles away or more.  I am not real good at judging the three dimensional trajectory when I&#39;m below it looking up at it in really a two dimensional perspective.  Either way, it was extremely low to the ground and like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before.  After my initial reaction of a shooting star was exluded, my next thought was that it was a meteorite falling to earth, basically like a shooting star that made it all the way down to here. I also entertained the idea that it was a plane crash or other air disaster (army experiment gone wrong, bad rocket launch, poorly aimed satelite or other man made space device falling from orbit, my imagination really took off in that small instant!), as the fiery mass trailing smoke, flame, and burning off pieces of debris reminded me of some of the pictures I saw with the recent space shuttle tragedy where pieces or wreckage were scattered, falling to the earth in a fiery mass trailing fire and debris with striking similarity to the object I witnessed.  However, it mostly resembled a meteorite to me.  It moved at an incredible rate of speed, a speed that I never thought possible, faster than any plane I&#39;ve ever seen, including the Blue Angels fighter jets that do an annual airshow in seattle.  The main fireball mass also seemed very large, too large to really be any sort of plane or wreckage.  It was a jaw dropping experience, one that made me cry out &#34;what the #@%$ was that?  Holy *#&amp;$! ! Did you see that?&#34; only I was the only one in the car, so I began looking around to other motorists as someone to share this incredible experience if any of them saw it too, but by them traffic started to move and I couldn&#39;t get a good look at anyone&#39;s face to sense anyone with similarly astonished expressions.  Wherever this thing fell, I wish I was there to see it, as it would be incredibly interesting I&#39;m sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports about this event.  The object is thought to have been a dramatic meteor over central or northern British Columbia.  PD))<n>

The afternoon sky was very clear with just a whisp of a cloud to the far norteast. Within a flash of possibly 5 seconds, coming from (southern direction towards the north) above traveling towards the northeast, I saw a ball of light with a tail streaming out of the sky in an arc heading towards the ground. The light appearded to me to look like a ball of shimmering mercury.  Then it just disappered. There was nothing lingering in the sky after it disappered.  There were no planes in the sky before or after the incident.  It also was not a somthing from a firework as there was absolutly no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for this time and date.  Object probably was a daytime meteor, which was seen over British Columbia, as well.  It was at least several hundred miles north of Seattle, we believe, and evidence suggests.  PD))<n>

I had just parked my vehicle in the lot (blue Chevy pickup truck).  As I exited my truck I looked up to watch a commercial jet liner crossing overhead ... coming over the mountains from north to south.  I thought to myself ... &#34;what a beautiful day ... the sky was dark blue ... perfectly clear&#34;.  I was facing west/northwest.  As I watched the jet liner cross overhead I noticed there was another object in the sky (at about 10 O&#39;clock)... it was a circular object ... it was very high up in the sky ... and just a couple seconds later I noticed there was another object (a duplicate) moving behind the first object to the left ... both objects seemed to be moving slowly approaching from the west ... both objects were moving toward me ... approximately 20 seconds later the second object made  a 90 degree change of direction (to my left) and disappeared very rapidly ... it streaked and was gone quickly ... the first object continued moving toward me and reached a position at about 11 O&#39;clock ... I watched the first object ... it seemed to be hovering at a very high altitude ... it was very high in the sky ... it was silver in color ... it gave off a silver/white glow or sheen ... perfectly round in shape ... it seemed to be glowing ... I watched the second object for maybe 2 minutes plus ... I thought to myself does anybody else see this ... there wasn&#39;t too many cars in the parking lot ... I looked around to see if anyone was close by ... when I looked back up in the sky I could not relocate the first object ... it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say that from my position the objects were definitely not conventional aircraft ... they were perfectly round in shape ... they were much smaller than the airplane that had just passed in front ... they seemed much smaller than the airplane because they were so much higher altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

By 3:30am she was asleep and I was just staring into the East Northeast direction approximately 30 dgrees down from the straight above position.  In a split second I witnessed a large busrt of yellow light in a perfect circular shape looking to be 3&#34; diameter from my point of view. This was definately out in space outer earth atmosphere or further. 1 Second later immediately below &amp; to the right of where this occurred I saw a white flash of light about the size of what the International Space Station looks like going overhead. I sat up saying &#34;what the **** was that?!&#34;  I startled her out of her sleep and she asked &#34;what?&#34; I told her to turn and look - I had seen the small white flash again only this time it was 45 dgrees to the right of its original postion. Both times it had flashed on for approximately 1 sec.  As she became more awake I pointed to the area that the light would hopefully show again. Of course it didn&#39;t.  This was the most spectacular thing I have ever witnessed - better than my June 21st sighting.  I would love to be hypnotized and taken back to the 24th burst of light and have the description of what I see recorded.  If it was a star exploding which I doubt is there any place I can inquire that would know.  I truely beleave that what I witnessed was the burst of an alien craft coming out of light speed or thru a worm hole or teleportation burst of some sort.  I am not nuts and could not beleave what I saw.  I know others had to see this... p! lease help explain what I saw and are there any other reports -EVER - that report the same burst - size - perfect circular shape - no after effect illumination or glow - I have not reported this to anyone...after all I wouldnt blame you if even you didnt beleave me...It does sound far fetched but it is the truth &amp; like I said before - hynotized me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up in the sky and said to the others, &#34;Hey, look at tha...&#34; I was speachless. I thought I was calling attention to a shooting star, but it was too close. The object was luminous, a mauve or orange-red color. We each had a different opinion of the exact color. It seemed to be oval, but had 3 lights evenly spaced, like a triange, on the bottom. It made no noise. It flew from north to south as I saw it (I didn&#39;t look at it until it disappeared). It followed the main north/south road in town (Broadway). One of my friends said she initially thought it was a something falling from the sky, like a person, but as she looked at it she saw what the rest of us did. She also saw this thing suddenly go east when it hit the horizon (I had looked away by that point). I hate to call this thing a UFO because I still don&#39;t know if I believe in that.  It&#39;s just that I have no explaination. I have seen in the past where geese would fly over during the night and you can see the reflection of the city lights on their bellies. It wasn&#39;t that. Too high and they definately aren&#39;t quiet. It wasn&#39;t an airplane from the International airport. It was too high and it wasn&#39;t a plane. There is an Air Force Base about 10 miles to the north of the city. It has mainly B52&#39;s and missles. That didn&#39;t make sense either. I tried to ask one of my friends about it a few weeks later, and she said she wouldn&#39;t talk about it. I wrote an entry in my diary that night. I&#39;ve hardly spoken of the incident, and have never reported it before this. I guess I don&#39;t even believe myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed it from my backyard and was visible through the trees, this is why it caught my eye. I&#39;m no astronomer so it could be venus or another celestial body, even a satellite but I have never noticed it before and it appears synthetic to my untrained eye. As of 1:57am it is still visible and appears to have moved somewhat. Not moving very much though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have witnessed the planet, Mars, which is quite prominent, currently.

I ran into my house to get my bonoculars and when i came outside the object was about a quarter of the way across the sky and moving at a moderate speed and was still at a very hight altitude. when i went back to see it with the binoculars it was flashing silver. it was silver then it stoped flashing for a second or too and flashed from silver to black and repeated until it went out of my view behind houses and a tree. when i looked at it with the binoculars though, It flashed from silver to what looked like a black horizontal line, i guess maybe whats called a cigar or a rod.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eyes on it until i could not see it anymore. the sky was clear and sunny and i can say that i got a very good look at this object.<n>

Affter about 15 min. it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 18 year old son returned home with 4 of his friends at approximately 12:15 am, when they spotted a large red light moveing across the sky and stopping on the north side of our home.  My son came into my room and woke me up to use the camcorder to film the light.  I thought he was talking about a red light about the size of a star, but when I went out with him, the red light, it was huge and a dark red.  It appeared to be the size of maybe a red light signal, or slightly larger.  I was so amazed that I went inside to call my oldest son on the phone.  I dialed his number, and got a recording to a business that my deceased husband worked for prior to his death, in July of 1999.  I could not believe my ears, so I hung up and pressed redial and looked at the number on the display.  It was my sons number, and again the recording came on.  I let my son and daugher listen to the recording, each time pressing the redial button and looking at the displayed number.  I have never memorized his work number, nor have I called that number since 1999.  This was a shock to me, because, even if I had dialed a wrong number, what were that chances that I would get that business.  As my son continued to record this light it appeard to come closser and then it went further out, pulsed a few times and then just dissapeared.  We all went inside to see what was filmed on tv.  At approximately 12:40 am, I called channel 11 news, tip desk.  I told them what we had seen, and the gentlemen informed me that there were 3 other calls out of Motebello reporting the same red light.  I told him that we had footage, and he took my information and said that someone would call us in the morning.  By noon on Aug. 24th, we still had not heard from channel 11, so I called channel 5, who suggested that we take the tape to the studio so that they could make a copy of it.  The gentleman that spoke to my son, told him that it was probbably mars, but after reviewing and copying the tape, he said that it was not mars, labled the t! ape UFO and told my son that they would call him if they used it.  We have not heard from them to date.  I still have the origenal tape, except that I inadvertently tape over a small portion of it, however the beginging of the filming and the ending where it dissapears is still in tack.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to just sit there so we were all wondering what it could be. I got the binnoculars to take a lil closser look and it was bright red,half around the circle was more red lights aroun the object there had to be at least 20 lights but the same color as the object. all of a sudden it faded a bit and finally it disapeard as if it was sucked up into space. I called various news stations to see if they had any other calls on this but they all said oh its just mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know and everyone else knows that this can not be a planet. Planets dont just get sucked up into space the way we wittnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Mystery solved Noises in sky just Lockheed flight tests  By DAVE HIRSCHMAN The Atlanta Journal-Constitution  The mystery of the t|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31088.html|215|ndxe200308| Boom! Mystery solved Noises in sky just Lockheed flight tests  By DAVE HIRSCHMAN The Atlanta Journal-Constitution  The mystery of the twin booms that have startled people from Chattanooga to Huntsville since June has been solved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The culprits are new F/A-22 Raptor fighters and chase planes making supersonic test flights over the region. So far 17 of the futuristic jets have been built at Lockheed Martin&#39;s plant in Marietta, and all must show they can break the sound barrier before being handed over to the Air Force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only problem is that no one let folks in the flight path know the sonic booms were coming. When residents asked the military about the alarming noises, every branch denied having any planes in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Each boom sounds like an explosion,&#34; said Jess Hornsby, 61, of Signal Mountain, Tenn., a Chattanooga suburb. He estimates he&#39;s heard 10 in the last three months. &#34;There&#39;s no rumbling like thunder. It&#39;s a loud crack that really rattles the windows. People here have been wondering what in the world was going on.&#34;  Hornsby, a self-described aviation buff, said he looked up the first time he heard the booms and saw two white contrails streaking overhead. Each F/A-22 is shadowed by an F-16 chase plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> U.S. Rep. Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.) said the first time he heard the twin booms, he thought a coal mine had exploded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I thought I was going to have a heart attack,&#34; Wamp said. &#34;It was such a high impact.&#34;  Greg Caires, a spokesman at the Marietta plant, said the planes typically fly about 40,000 feet on a route that takes them from Crossville, Tenn., to Scottsboro, Ala. The planes cover the 110-mile route in about four minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flights follow an existing FAA-approved &#34;supersonic corridor,&#34; so rules that prohibit breaking the sound barrier over the continental United States don&#39;t apply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lockheed says it tries to minimize disruptions by avoiding Sunday flights and keeping the planes high. Caires says security rules prohibit the company from telling residents in advance when supersonic flights will take place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Caires and Randy Neville, an F/A-22 test pilot and University of Tennessee grad, traveled to Chattanooga and Huntsville last week to let residents know what the planes have been doing in the skies overhead -- and to expect more booms in the future. Lockheed is accelerating F/A-22 production and plans to build more than 300 of the fighters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once residents learned the planes were on their side, Caires said, Lockheed got a warm reception.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;People are very supportive and think the supersonic flights are really cool,&#34; Caires said. &#34;I tell them to look to the southwest next time they hear the booms -- but they better look fast, because the planes won&#39;t be there long.&#34;<n>

I thought it was unusual and continued to watch and realized that it was moving in my direction. I watched the object continuously for about 15 minutes only leaving twice. Once to get my wife and the once to get binocculars. As it got nearer, the object appeared brighter (no doubt because of its proximity) and also other colors were evident. I waited too long to look at it with binocculars but when I did was suprised at the richness of the color. The &#34;front&#34; was a deep blue approaching violet. The center was a brilliant green and the back was a deep red. It was difficult to perceive any definite shape. There appeared to be at least a dozen lights within the colors but didn&#39;t appear to be the source of the color. It&#39;s important to note that the colors I saw didn&#39;t look like a reflection off of any kind of fusalage but rather appeared as a glow like one would observe from neon. The object made no noise, didn&#39;t change direction, speed or altitude. The lights didn&#39;t change in intensity nor did they blink. I am posting this after having read another post from my town around the same time. I think they entered the time wrong, however. http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30886.html Also, because of the time of the sighting and the direction it was going, I think the sighting of an object in Mt Laguan at 12:10 that morning may somehow be related. http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30871.html I do have a posting on the internet for the next morning at an independent source so it can be verified that I reported this before reading the the other sightings in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The two air crafts were there for about two min and then left and the space-ship also faded away. Now around 12:30 as I was leaving a friend&#39;s house i was looking up at the sky the space-ship appeared again by this time i was somewhat prepared with a camera, so i took three pictures, now my younger brother had the bonaculars said he seen a diamond shap object which my sister and mother also saw through the bonaculars it then faded away for the last time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He spotted flashing lights that were stationary.  He first thought either a helicopter or a plane.  After 10 minutes of watching he called me into the garden to have a look.  I watched for about 10 minutes with binoculars and the naked eye (the clours flashing were to me blue and red).  The lights did not move.  We both watched as an aeroplane higher up than the lights went past it and past us, so this confirmed it was not an aeroplane nor we agreed the local police helicopter.  We then spotted another light that was lower and off to the left of the first one, this was hidden by low cloud.  After about 15 minutes and returned indoors.  My husband had gone in and got the video camera and carried on filming the lights and did not come indoor until 23.30.  During this time the lights did not move and as I am typing this I&#39;ve sent him outside to see if they are still there.  Having never experienced anything like this before and being of an open mind about ufos is there an rational explanation for these lights?  I have just gone outside with my husband at 23.50 and the two lights are still there they have moved slightly from their original places but one does seem bigger than the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were stood in our garden with backs to a fence and there were no lights from houses behind us and we had no lights on in the garden.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star is a possible explanation for the sighting, although that is just a guess.  We will invite the witnesses to look at the same area of the sky at about the same time on the next clear night.  PD))<n>

We looked through the binoculars at the &#34;star&#34;, and realized it indeed DID have blinking lights on it - they were very clear to both the naked eye AND through the binoculars.  As we all stood wondering what the hell it was, we noticed it was moving very strangely - we were all mezmorized.  I was so perplexed that I ven woke up our next door neighbors and showed them as well - EVERYONE was completely amazed as it was obviously NOT a plane of any sort.  We live near a small airport, and see planes every day.  This was NOT a plane.  After leaving my neighbors, I returned to the backyard to join my husband and brother, who had noticed very clearly ANOTHER UFO hovering VERY close to the ground seemingly only a few streets away - it seemed to be looking right at us.  We videotaped ALL of it.  There was also a VERY unusual amount of military air traffic that night, and four HUGE lighted government jets I have never seen before zoomed over our house towards the objects while we watched.  Pretty freaky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we went inside to watch our video, all of the close up footage was gone and almost ALL of the other coverage had also been erased, however we still have VERY clear footage of the first object we saw!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request &#34;still&#34; images from the video.

This object was in Triangular form, large, I would estimate 400 feet across, flying lower than any plane, with orange lights along two of the Triangle&#39;s legs.  This was flying I would guess 300-400 Mph, but hard to guess as all other objects ( planes ) were much smaller. There were no planes nearby at all when this object appeared and was heading North East in the same direction as a plane would have if headed towards aiport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As they were passing, at least a couple dozen  more, but higher up and smaller came over and split off in different directions.  The original ones kept going and finally disappeared from sight.  But we could still see some of the others.  We concentrated on a grouping of 5.  They were pretty high, but we could still see the green color.  They stopped and moved toward each other.  Then they seperated and seemed to follow each other. Then they disappeared.  Their speed was faster than an airplane, and on the right direction for a satelite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally lucid and objective about the sighting she and her husband experienced.  We suspect they are highly credible witnesses.  Also, we received another telephoned message of a sighting from the San Diego area, close to San Marcos, for the same night, but the witness failed to leave her telephone number, so we were unable to return the call.

At first i thought it was a star, but it started to get bigger. &#34;Oh it&#39;s just a Helicopter&#34; i thought, but it did not have a red flashing light. Then it became more clearer, and you could see the shape more clearly. (shaped like a disk) Then the white light stopped and red lights started flashing (three red lights one after another), not like a planes red flashing light. These lights were going around the ship, not in one spot like a plane. The ship then started to move across the sky over our heads at a high speed (about five times faster than a plane). Then it just dissapeared. I have never seen anything like this before. There where many planes flying over head that night, but this was not a plane. Planes have a white and red flashing lights and you can see the out line of the plane as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was watching it and couldn&#39;t make out what it was.As it approached the highway it turned and headed north. It was flying about 80-100 feet above the highway between the two lanes.It was passing the on coming traffic so i estimated the speed to be around 140-150 klm hr. As it got close to the cars on the road it would flip on its side as it went passed them almost like it was looking at them. It then approached our truck.We were driving right at it when it flew right over top of the truck. I lost site of it as i was the driver and couldn&#39;t turn around safely to watch it. My wife then told me the &lt;what ever it was&gt; turned to the west and was climbing upwards at a high rate of speed. she watched it until it was gone. From the time it passed over us until it was no long visible only took secounds.The object was around 4-5 ft in diameter had a silver center and darker colored chrome balls or like disks around the middle of it.There was lots of traffic on the highway at this time and I&#39;m sure others must have seen this thing.I did report this to the Winnipeg airport airtraffic control center and they gave me the name and number of a person to contact.I did and they said they would check it out.This was the most bizzar thing i have ever seen in my life had i been alone i wouldn&#39;t have told anyone because they wouldn&#39;t have believed it.  thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I realized it was a UFO when I noticed its shape, size and the way it moved itself. The shape was like a silver, gigantic coin floating horizontally, bigger than a bird, and it was flying about 100 ft above the ground. The thing that really cought my attention was, its movement. It was as if a string was pierced through the middle of it and the &#34;coin&#34; was balancing itself while forwarding on a perfectly straight line, above the golf course. I thought I was going nuts, but the wierdest thing was, a year later, I saw the same object doing the same thing, as if being its routine or something. The only thing that kept me from thinking that I&#39;m seeing things again, was my mother being an eyewitness too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I happened to look up and saw 2 stationary lights in the sky.  Both had the appearance of a star (about the brightness of Jupiter at night) and were roughly a few miles apart (best guess).  Neither had any color, the same color as starlight.  Common sense told me that they couldn&#39;t have been stars during broad daylight so out of curiosity I stood there and watched.  My first thought was that they were balloons very high up, but as I stood there and the minutes rolled by, I seriously doubted that as neither one had moved whatsoever.  I noticed, to my amazement, that the light closest to me had a very tiny light flying in circles rapidly around it.  That disappeared and the two lights just sat there motionless.  Neither of the two bright ones moved at all during this time.  I put the groceries away and came back out about 3-4 minutes later and noticed that the light that was farthest away had moved farther east of the other.  Neither was moving but I know for a fact that the one had moved while I was in the house, it was visibly noticable.  I sat watching for about 10 more minutes and nothing.  I found a pair of binoculars and had a look... both looked like stars... very high up and a simple dot of light, just like a star would look.  I went back in the house... and about 5 minutes later, curiosity got the best of me so I stepped back outside to have a look.  Both lights had completly vanished but there were about 4(?) very tiny lights flying around... all very small and much dimmer then the two before.  Hard to believe, but they were flying around each other... kind of a dogfight and I had the feeling that they were very high up.  As I watched they all kind of just faded and that was it.  Needless to say, I had a hard time processing what my eyes were seeing.  Anyway, there you have it.. thanks and had to tell someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sighting was later verified as having been seen by two Mexican laborers I had working on my property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you can see by the attached photos (jpegs) of which there are two (2) the sighting was photographed with an old digital camera close by the edge of a street in VOC and shows the same landscape with about a 10-feet difference.  I am sending you four jpegs of the sighting of which two are enlargements of the object in question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For your information, although I would prefer anonymity regarding what I am sending you, my wife and I are known artists, although 30 some years in the past I was, for 14-years, a trained US Army Special Forces NCO and worked in intelligence and communications under the command and control of the CIA.  The reason for my telling you this is that if there is an investigation it will not leave you hanging for a response.  Also, there is the fact that since 2000 I have video-taped a number of unidentified flying objects in and nearby VOC; but enough of the past as this sighting was accidental as at the time my wife was photographing monsoon clouds to use in her paintings and we did not see the object until the photographs were downloaded onto our computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even then the object was thought to have been a speck of dirt or other material on the lens.  It wasn’t until I began enlarging the photographs that I sighted; on the bottom left of the photo a red spot lighted area upon the ground and above, on the top left, a white spot lighted area on a cloud.  Reflected sunlight?  However, photo nr. two shows, on the bottom left, only a white spotlighted area on the ground.  Further enlargements of the black spot (see corresponding formation of sky surrounding the unknown object) piqued my curiosity when it showed an oval object that looks to be a person in side the object, standing before a vertical rectangular object (control board?).  I will leave it up to you as to what the object is and, if you find it intriguing, enlarge the object yourself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the Mexican laborers, they told me they had sighted the same object while changing a flat tire on their vehicle.  They also stated that the object had then approached and landed upon one of the Mesas in the background shown in my photos.  When they returned home and told their families they had been ridiculed so they hadn’t told anyone else other than their employer.  Later, while working upon a studio for me I showed the photos to their employer and he then showed it to the two men and they told me that the object was the same one they had sighted.  Unfortunately, I didn’t have the two men write down what they had seen and like the unknown day we took the photos I or my wife cannot provide any further information.<n>

We layed down flat and starred into the clear blue sky.  I saw a strange circular/saucer object moving very fast from south to north, and very high in the sky 15,000 ft?.  I pointed it out to my wife and she thought it was just a baloon at first, but it then it started to change directions and finally stopped and hovered (wobbeling) and moving short distances. I appeared white or perhaps silver in color (metallic?). Then we could not beleive it, a second indentical craft appeared out of no where and it appeared they began to chase one another in circles (less than a minute) then one the crafts just disapeared. Then the remaining craft acted bewildered as to the location of the other craft and just cruised slowly towards the west and then it appeared gain altitude rapidly straight up util it disapeared.  We have never witnessed anything like this before it was incredible!  Sorry, I would rather not submit contact info, I have already described in full detail everything that we had seen.<n>

I looked up in the sky and saw what I thought could possibly be a balloon. I looked at it longer and realized that it looked more like a moving star. It was a whitish-silvery color. I called to my husband to come take a look at it but by then it had gone behind a cloud. It moved pretty fast in a straight line. I didn&#39;t give it much thought until now. It was quite strange and I am sure that it was in fact not a balloon. I am a 24 year old stay at home mom. I don&#39;t have a lot of interest in UFOs and the like but I thought this was worth sharing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Got binoculars and saw that it was some sort of object that was very, very bright.  The flashing lights seemed random.  When I squinted, the lights were in line with each other.  At one point, the lights went into an arc, then flattened out again.  Observed it for approx. 2 hours.  At one point, the object seemed to move from side to side.  Then, as the sky was lightening with the impending sunrise, the object started to slowly rise upward until it could not be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6:00 am:  Got husband and he observed object also.

This object was not as large as object in southeast sky on previous mornings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5:30-6:00 am:  Was watching object in northeast sky.  Object in southeast sky seemed closer because it looked bigger.  Within a few seconds as I was watching the northeast object, I looked again at the southeast object and it was directly over the mountains and big and bright again.  The object in the northeast sky started to go upwards and became smaller until it was no longer visible.  The object in the southeast sky was very bright and seemed larger than previous mornings.  This object could still be seen even after the sky had lightened enough for the other stars in the sky to disappear.  Between 6:30-7:00 am, it moved upwards until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wednesday, August 27, 2003: 4:00 am:  Cloud cover, object not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6:00 am:  Cloud cover, object not visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thursday, August 28, 2003: 5:30 am:  Object in southeast sky over Wasatch Mtns. very bright.

It also came back on another occasion a few days later but did not stay in the vicinity very long. I talked with the fellow (retied military man) first of all and this is his report he gave me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object at one point sat straight over top of their home and was the size of a baseball. The witnesses location is a little south west from Airdrie on the west side of Highway #2. The color on the object changed from white to orange and back again. The object did turn a brilliant blue at one time. The fellow said it was stationary over his home for minutes, then could move from east to west and continue carrying out these types of maneuvers. The fellow actually thought the object was intrigued with the fire they had going in the backyard. He told me the total amount of time the couple watched the object was around two hours. (HBCC UFO Note: Due to the large amount of time the object was witnessed, I asked if the object moved with other astronomical bodies in the sky, and the fellow said no !) He said whatever it was, was moving all over the sky. To make it clear, whatever they were looking at, I was told when they looked away, then looked back at the object, it was in a different part of the sky. Then would make it&#39;s move back to where it came from. Both of the witness thought it moved to get out of the way of air traffic as there were aircraft active in that area. They also watched the object move up and down, then move far over to the right, drop down a ways, then move back to the left. (HBCC UFO Note: Both of the folks used the roof of their home as a referrerence point so they knew how far the object moved to the left, right and up and down. At some points in this sighting, they would lose sight of it due to it dropping behind the roof, but it would rise back up again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He took a guess and figured the object was sitting at approx: 5000 feet and could see the roundness of it. He told me there was sound coming from it. He described it like being a vent people have on the top of their roofs. (the rotating kind, but the sound was at a very low level). Also when the sound was heard, lights would come on around the circumference of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also asked if they had any pets who were with them at the time of the sighting. He said yes. The fellow told me in his words, the three cats went a little squirrelly. He said they seem to cower down, ears fell back and two of then started to hiss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: The below information comes from the gentleman&#39;s wife. I will not give out what her occupation is as it could cause problems if this information came out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The wife told me the object would have been located approx: 5,000 feet in altitude as she has knowledge of how the aircraft fly in and out of the airport. She said it was certainly hovering around the airport area and the night was very calm and silent. She also confirmed the object did make a strange low pitched noise which she thought was rather eerie. From what she observed, she could see white lights running around the object and another light sitting at the bottom of the craft and it would change from orange to blue. When the object moved in any direction all the white lights went out, but the light at the bottom did stay on, when the object came to a complete stop, the white lights running around it came back on. She said it was definitely round in shape. She said they both thought they were seeing things and did not want to tell anyone about it due to others thinking they were crazy. But it sounds like to me the witnesses had a good seat for an exciting display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to both of the witnesses for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

It was low, it was big, it was motionless, and had alot of lights, and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And it was right in front of me, I could hit it with a rock if i had one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car and stood in the road and was trying to comprehend what I was seeing. About 30  yards from the road, at about the height of a telephone pole, was a huge boomerang/trianglor shape craft, with alot of blicking lights on the bottom. Mostly red and white, but some other colors as well. I stood somewhat under it for about a minute and just looked at it. I could not hear any sound and no air was moving. I was still trying to comprehend this. It just sat their blinking and motionless for about a minute. Then it tilted and slowly moved accross the road I was stopped on, and dropped low below a tree line. It came within 25 yards of my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 seconds, it rose from the tree line, repositioned itself directly over the 2 lane road I was stopped on,and slowly proceeded down the road at about 5mph at first, at about 100 feet above the road. At this time I could see that it&#39;s width was about 3 - 4 times the width of the road. I got back in my car to attempt to follow it. I was able to follow it for about 30 yards when in an instant, it was a mile down the road. I could still see it, and cars were passing under it. But I could not understand how it can be directly in front of me, and then in a flash be a mile away. The next morning I went back to the field it was hovering over, but could find no evidence of anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a very very close look at this thing that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that day, I believe I saw it 2 more times, in the same general area. These 2 additional sightings were at more of a distance and shorter duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

She said it looked like a squared off kind of craft with four lights, nothing like an airplane or helicopter. She telephoned the Kamloops airport to see if they had any other sightings of this kind come into them, but after leaving a message at the airport on an answering machine, they never did get back to her. Also she called the RCMP and they told her they had no other reports come in on this and mentioned to her that she must have been blurred by the smoke in the area and thought she saw something.

8/22/03 21:45|Rome|GA|Unknown|20 seconds|My friend and I heard strange whistling sounds with many other people in a Wal-Mart parking lot.|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30970.html|243|ndxe200308| My friend and I heard strange whistling sounds with many other people in a Wal-Mart parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I left a Wal-Mart Supercenter at 9:45 pm EDT.  The store number for this location is 658 according to Wal-Mart&#39;s website.  As we approached and entered into my vehicle, a whistling sound like a jet landing at close range was heard.  The sound began at a high frequency, about 18,000 hertz but decreased in pitch at a constant rate until the frequency of the sound was inaudible.  The sound lasted about eight to ten seconds per event and it was heard a minimum of three full times.  The first time that I heard the sound, I thought it sounded like a small military jet landing nearby.  However, this sound was too pure and ambient like it was coming from many different directions at the same time.  My friend and I didn&#39;t say anything to each other during the first event, but by the time I started the car and decided to leave the parking spot, we heard it again.  The windows in my car were rolled down and I saw a lady at a range of fifteen feet who was two men ask, &#34;what is that noise?&#34;  The noise sounded as it did the first time.  By then my friend and I asked each other what we thought it was.  My friend described it as a jet plane landing but there was no jet.  We are not from this area.  We were only driving through on our way for a weekend camping trip.  We are not familiar with any type of airfields in the area, civil or military.  As we exited the parking lot we could hear the sound once again, but this time it sounded more distant.  The only explanation that my friend and I could rationalize is if there is some type of very loud, crisp, ambient car stereo technology that is on the market that we are unaware of.  This sound was loud and it seemed to permeate through the entire parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a few dozen people walking in and out of the Wal-Mart at this time.  It appeared that many people heard these sounds and they were perplexed as we were.  It was a warm, humid and hazy night and the sky was unable to be seen due to the haze and the lights from the area.  The performance of my vehicle was unaffected.  My dog in the backseat of my car seemed tense, but not abnormally so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have received several reports recently of sounds, for which there is no ready explanation for what causes them.  PD))<n>

I felt a slight surge of energy &amp; looked up, there was what appeared to be a star overhead.  As I stood looking at it, it appeared to move.  I figured it was actually I who moved, so found a place to lie down.  The &#34;star&#34; continued to move, back &amp; forth &amp; up &amp; down, in what appeared to me to be a random manner.  I watched for awhile, then went in for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been watching for the past several nights, &amp; gradually become aware of more &#34;moving stars&#34;.  I sometimes have sensations in peripheral vision like small bursts of light, or meteors/&#34;falling stars&#34;, but this never happens when I&#39;m looking directly at the area where these occur.  On one occasion, I was watching the &#34;star&#34; closest to overhead, when I noticed another light with peripheral vision that had not been there before.  Unlike the lights I&#39;d been watching, this one moved in a straight line, &amp; I assumed it was a plane, but it suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Myself and my younger brother were driving to the local movie rental store, we live in a pretty rural area so there werent that many other cars on the road. i was driving ast a local highschool and on the opposite side of the school there is a field. a very bright white light caught my eye, and i wasnt sure what it was i had never seen a light there before. i thought that maybe there was a stadium light in the field, because thats how bright it was. then it began t move, so naturally i figured it was a plane. then my younger brother said , wow thats a weird looking plane. i turned and looked agian and there were more than grren and red lights, like on a plane, and  te closer i looked at it , the les it was shaped like a plane, but more cigar shaped, and there was a very brightwhite light and a purple glow like i had never seen before. so naturaly i picked up my cell phone to call my mom to tell her what we had just seen, but my cell hone had no service. i drive on that road every day, i have never had recepetion problems on that road before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> and thats my story<n>
8/22/03 20:10|Antioch|TN|Unknown|approx. 20 min.|Four lights circling inside storm cloud|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30868.html|247|ndxe200308| Four lights circling inside storm cloud<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 20:00, while I was watching weather reports on TV of a big storm moving due south into the Nashville area, a very strong gust of wind hit my house and I decided to go outside and check out the approaching storm. It hadn&#39;t started raining yet, but the wind was very strong and the street&#39;s electricity flickered on and off several times. After several minutes something in the sky southwest of me caught my attention--- there were four lights circling inside or above the clouds. They were large and diffuse, much like those of an airplane coming in on approach above a low cloud ceiling, but there was no aircraft noise and they just kept circling. The path of the circle they made must have been at least a half mile in diameter, but it only took a second or so for each light to complete a rotation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been watching for about a minute when my next door neighbor came out on her front porch, so I pointed it out to her as well. While we were watching, my wife arrived home from the store and all three of us stood in the front yard staring and trying to come up with a rational explanation while the storm got closer and closer. The only thing we could come up with was that it was a group of spotlights, though not once did we see a shaft of light from the ground, nor did it seem to be striking the underside of the clouds. Instead, it seemed to be coming from behind the clouds. Every so often one or two lights would break from the circle and swing very wide. I have no idea what kind of promotional spotlights are on the market now, but I can&#39;t imagine one that could spin a cluster of lights that fast, or why someone would be trying to promote their business in this manner just moments before a huge electrical storm moved into the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rain began shortly thereafter and eventually obscured the lights from view, although we kept watching the storm from our porch. The storm itself was somewhat odd, but I don&#39;t want to take up space describing that here. My wife and I came outside again at about 23:00 and saw the lights again, this time almost directly above us. The storm had passed but it was still overcast above us. We watched and tried to determine a point of origin, but could not pinpoint one. Several times we noticed little clouds lighting up that must have been between the light we could see and its source, which reinforced our belief that the light source was above the clouds. We still never saw a beam of light from the ground. Also, if the light was coming from the ground, it seems like the spots of light in the cloud would have been elongated at their furthest point from the source and rounder at their closest point, especially after the whole thing moved from its point before the storm to its later point that was miles closer, meaning the the angle from the ground would have to have been much sharper, but the lights seemed to be pretty uniform throughout their rotation. At about 23:28, all the lights disappeared but one, which stopped moving and then disappeared also. I half expected to see them again tonight and discover that they were just regular spotlights being used for some sort of promotion, but there was nothing to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It changed direction very quickly. I made my wife and fathe in law get out of the bed to see it and they confirmed that they were seeing the same thing I was. This lasted for about an hour or so, until I lost visual contact due to cloud cover.

8/21/03 23:15|Bristol|IN|Diamond|2-5 minutes|Diamond Lights dance in the Heavens|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46165.html|251|ndxe200308| Diamond Lights dance in the Heavens<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at a friend&#39;s backyard in Bristol, Indiana on a late warm summer night in 2003. The home was located in a large clearing on top of a countryside hill &amp; we were enjoying the stars and trying to see our Milky-way in space. While viewing the night time sky &amp; spotting the Big &amp; Little Dippers, Orion and other mythical shapes, I noticed a few satellites crossing below the stars which is not unusual in the summer months on a clear night. But while one satellite slowly passed overhead, something unfamiliar was occuring even higher in the stary heavens. As I focused toward space to what &#34;I THOUGHT&#34; was another glistening man made space craft certainly was not! Maybe it was a falling star or a blinking light of an aircraft, but the spot of light (the size of a star) began to move faster than the satellite in the foreground. The semi-circular shape was traveling in a South bound direction &amp; it then slowed down and instantly changed directions &amp; was now traveling North bound without a single stop in action. No human device, rocket, plane or Stealth bomber can do that manuvuer in a split second, I exclaimed!! I asked my friend to watch the dancing light in the sky and she witnessed the same occurance as I. I believe this was a massive object because of its particular size to the stars up in the darkness of space. The distance was far more farther away than the satellites that traveled across the sky. This was not a shooting star with a tail for there was no tail or icy trail behind the object. As we watched the sparkling object continue its dance, yet ANOTHER orb exactly like this one joined with the first to play a game of tag. As the first orb continued to move North to South and then East to West in a triangular pathway, the second circular object followed the same direct path as the first orb. It was a game of chase for the two objects and they were not harming each other but only staying as close as they could travel behind one another without hitting themselves. The two orbs traveled with no sound and reacted as a rubber ball would bounce off of the surfaces that it touched. But in space, as we know it, does not have &#34;A surface&#34; to bounce off of. Which made me more curious about this event. I blinked my eyes to be sure I was truly seeing this event unfold probably a 1000 miles away, or so it seemed, in the night sky. I asked my friend if she was the second orb in the same pathway as the first and she agreed that there was now two bright objects in the sky that were playing a game of tag. Then as fast as the objects came into sight, they swirled away together as though they were sucked into a vortex and diminished into space &amp; gone from our sight. It was then I realized that this was a UFO encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.  PD))<n>

Anyway, first I saw what appeared to be a small bright light moving fast from the west moving to the east, from my right to my left. It stopped, appeared to hover for only a moment before changing shape and color. From the single light it appeared to generate 3 separate redish/pale burgundy lights that moved into a kind of triangle shape. The elapsed time at this point was about 20 seconds or so. Before it sped away to the east, it reformed into a single bright light and that&#39;s everything, I did not see it again although I kept watching for another hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When, what I believed to be an airplane suddenly had four or five yellow glowing balls of light appear one at a time behind it, in a line. I told my wife to look, which she did. We both watched the balls of light seem to hang in the air and then disappear several seconds later. All I could think is they were signal flares,she was unsure. Before the balls of light had disappeared the red light had changed course and sped out of sight to the south at the same high rate of speed. There were other people walking along the beach and fishing on a public fishing pier nearby who must have seen the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the report is not inconcistent with a military jet releasing flares of some variety, perhaps the type designed to confuse an infra-red- homing anti-aircraft missile.  However, it would be unusual for an aircraft to do that over a populated area, we believe, unless the flares were released accidently.  PD))<n>

We were 17 miles off the coast of Jamestown and it was night time. The sky was extremly clear that night so i was watching for shooting stars when i noticed a bright light, very bright light coming from what seemed to be aircraft. I alerted my husband to it to see what he thought &#39;they&#39; were doing. I had thought it was a helicopter possibly looking for a person or a boat in trouble b.c the light was so bright. i went below to get binoculars and gave them to my husband since he is very familiar with the different types of aircraft. The aircraft was alone at that time, and from what i could tell had one bright light. It wasn&#39;t far from the ocean like an airplane might be. It flew at the height of what most helicopters fly when they are looking for something.What shocked me was the pattern in which it flew. It wasn&#39;t flying staight nor was it flying in a zig zag. it seemed to be flying in a circular pattern...almost as if it were going around another object. I couln&#39;t hear any noise except the waves in the ocean. We watched it til it was almost out of sight. At that point, i thought i saw another one about 90 degrees away from the original one but I am unsure. ( my husband said he saw smaller lights.I am unable to confirm this as he had the binoculars for some time.)<n>

When I looked in the sky I saw a rapidly flashing light with VERY erratic movements appearing to cover great distances and lasting several minutes.  It then went lower in the sky until we could not see it anymore.  There is no doubt in my mind this was unlike any aircraft I&#39;ve ever witnessed before!<n>

8/21/03 16:30|Ottawa (Canada)|ON|Flash|seconds|Object photographed with digital camera but not seen by the naked eye.|9/4/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31113.html|257|ndxe200308| Object photographed with digital camera but not seen by the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the above date I went up on the roof of the apartment building we manage, it&#39;s a ten story building, to take some sample shots with a small digital camera we purchased from Radio Shack. The idea was to take a series of shots of the Ottawa skyline panning right to left, from East to North East, snapping the pictures in quick succession less than a second apart. The sun was behind me in the West and  high in the sky creating perfect lighting conditions for photography. It should be noted here that I saw absolutely no craft, bird, balloon, kite or anything that could explain what showed up on one of the pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back downstairs to our apartment I downloaded the pictures to our computer and proceeded to go over them one by one. When I got to picture 31 there was a small blur in the center of the picture which appeared to be moving from south to north in the same direction as the pictures I was taking. I checked all of the other pictures in case it was a hair on the lens or some other such anomally and found nothing, all the pictures were crystal clear. This &#34;object&#34; appeared to be about two kilometers from my position and at an altitude of about one hundred and fifty feet, our building is about one hundred and ten feet high and it appeared to be slightly higher than my line of sight. What interests me is the fact that I didn&#39;t see it with my own eyes, secondly, that the pictures taken right before and immediately after, less than a second apart, on the same plane do not have the same image on them. I can only surmise that if this was indeed a UFO it had to be going so incredibly fast that the human eye would not be able to capture or register mentally the image but that the camera did. Given that it is not an expensive digital camera the resolving power is much less than that of a more expensive camera with more pixels. I have toyed with the picture with a &#34;picture publisher program&#34; but my best efforts couldn&#39;t resolve more than some sort of a flat, blurred, dark object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion, it sure looks real but who&#39;s to say for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light was white, and at first it was about as bright as the brightest stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as we watched the light grew brighter and brighter, although it appeared relatively stationary over one point of the valley, quite high in the sky. Eventually the light was brighter than any star or planet could be. I don&#39;t think it was a helicopter, because we would have heard a helicopter in the still night, but this light made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to watch the light, it would move up and down and side to side in the air, but not very much.  It also grew brighter and dimmer at intervals.  As we watched, the intense bright light faded again, and eventually vanished completely.  The sky in that area was dark again.  Moments later the light reappeared in the same spot, and soon it was shining brightly again. The way the light waxed and waned reminded me of watching a lighthouse from a distance, where the light gets brighter, then fades away, then reappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching the light for about 45 minutes. In this time the light gradually moved away from us in a southwesterly direction.  We noticed that in addition to moving up and down and side to side, the light would appear to change shape, sometimes seeming to be two connected points of light, sometimes one large round point of light, sometimes a square shaped light.  The light would also seem to change colour - it was dominantly white, but sometimes seemed orange or green in colour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was still in the sky when we went to bed, but it did not return the next night.<n>

To the north looking over the Saginaw Bay I notice what I thought was a star in the lower portion of the sky. Nothing abnormal about it until it move into a loop and shot downward and upwards at about 70 degrees due north and faintly disapeared. I knew that it was not any type of aircraft, nor was no other aircraft in the vacinity at this time, because I was monitoring Cleveland Air Traffic Control Center. Where I live in Essexville MI, J-36 high altitude jet route cross over ar area. I believe this was some type of object that was sitting still for some time until it decicided to exit?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It lasted at most two and a half seconds.  The object was going from left to right and downward at approxamitly a 45-50 degree angle.  It left no trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The object appeared to be a meteor.  I also saw it in the northeastern sky, at the same time the witness indicates above.

It occurred in the north-northeastern sky at approximately 2322 hrs. (local/Pacific Daylight Time), and lasted approximately 1-3 seconds.  It may have passed through Cassiopeia, or just to the east of that formation, descending from left to right at approximately 30-40 degrees from the vertical, and traversing an estimated 40-50 degrees of arc.  Duration was approximately 1-3 seconds.  It left no visible trail, although it was shedding material as it descended.  No terminal burst was visible, and no sonic report was detected for up to 10 minutes after the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions were ideal for viewing at the time of the event.

I never believed this stuff was real so I just dismissed it.  I was sitting out on my front porch late one summer night and saw this sphere appear just above my rooftop. It could not have been more than 15 feet away from me. There was a full moon out and it paled in comparison to this orb. It was the brightest light that I have ever seen but it did not hurt my eyes. In the center of the sphere another bright light was moving extremely fast in the infinity pattern. I believe it was there for about 20 seconds, it could have been more or less than that. I have no memory of seeing it appear or vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object was travailing north towards me and then made a slow but hard left almost making a u-turn heading south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as the object traveled south west, noticing no sound coming from craft.  I notice 4 large round shaped lights underneath the craft, one on each corner and one in the center of the craft, the three corner lights were bright white and center was more of a cool blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer the object began to descend and stopped just above the tree line just left of me behind a car shop, about 50 - 75 yards away from me.  I pulled over and go out of my car.  I noticed a thin red line that wrapped around the c! raft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was some sort of hot air balloon...for the next 2 - 3 min it hovered over the tree line..  I noticed a few cars slowing down, people looking up at the craft and the racing off.  Still I was not thinking alien craft, i just kept thinking this is some secret military craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to my car to grab my digital camera and as I positioned myself to take a photo of the craft the object suddenly accelerated instantly, almost at a lightning speed straight up.  I could see it travel into space and at that moment I knew this was an out of this world craft (Alien UFO) I have only told a hand full of people, but have for the most part kept it to myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was observing the star Vega in the constellation of Lyra with a Meade refracting telescope and binoculars with a friend. When she commented that she had seen an faint blue flashing object in the binoculars just to the east of Vega. Passing the binoculars to me I panned slightly to the east of Vega and sure enough picked up a faint irregular flashing object on a northeastern heading. I was able to track the object for approximately 4 minutes. In that time it traversed possibly 15 degrees of the visible sky. At that point I lost the object from the field of view of the binoculars and wasn&#39;t able to pick it up again. This may have been one of the Cosmos Rocket (satellites/ space debris)<n>

My son called me outside at around 9:30 p.m to witness what he was seeing.  We saw 3 crafts in formation sort of like a long almost straight line but the one in the middle was up in formation just a little above the other 2 crafts.  They all had red, yellow, green and white flasing lights - all flashing at the same time and when I first saw it the way it was in the sky looked as if the lights aluminated the objects and it looked as if a silver line was connecting them.  It was the odest thing I have ever seen.  No airplanes fly in exact distance of formation like that.  We ran back through the foyer into the den and out the back door in seconds to see it from the back yard and it was nowhere to be seen in the sky.

The night was very dark and cloudy.  I was traveling home from the Rich Pond area toward the city of Bowling Green, Kentucky.  After I had left the Nashville Road, and began to drive on the Cave Mill Road, I noticed a very large bright red pulsating glowing light to my left out of the front windshield of my automobile.  Realizing that Bowling Green has a small airport, I at first thought it was an aircraft of some sort.  But then I began to notice that the object was not moving at all, and it was hovering silently in the same position.  There was no sound at all from the craft that I could hear.  I was now close to the Church of Later Day Saints on the Cave Mill Road, and the object was still hovering silently in the same spot.  Then all of a sudden the bright red pulsating glowing light somehow became smaller, and I could see that the object was triangular in appearance.  The object had a red pulsating light glowing underneath it, and also two smaller white lights on the back tip ends of the triangle.  I immediately pulled into the Church of Later Day Saints parking lot to observe the craft some more.  After watching it hover for close to five more minutes, the craft then began to slowly move away to the southwest.  The object was still so bright that I could see it moving away slowly for several miles before it finally disappeared.  This was indeed a very strange incident, and it DID happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no explanation for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It became clear very quickly as the camera focused on the object(s) that it was made up of a very large piece in the center that sort of resemble the shape of the state of Texas with other red glowing particles around it. at one point a piece maybe 2 percent of the size of the big piece shot off toward camera left.

These object were high in the sky, I would estimate 3000-4000 feet ?  As I looked more closely they began zig-zagging from one side of the highway to the other in a wide sweeping sharp motion. All this time the 3 objects were flashing and seemed to be chasing or following each other. They accelerated ahead of me , still seaming to follow the highway. They kept zig-zagging back and forth in sharp motions, NO aircraft that I ever saw could make these fast sharp-hard-left to right changes and stay airborne.  Much less 3 following each other in the same manor. The entire crafts were all plusing or flashing from back to front, after 2 to 3  minuets of observation they made  abrupt 90 degree verticle turns and headed straight up, vanishing in the nights&#39; sky.  It almost seemed like they were buzzing the highway, or observing the the many cars with  head &amp; tail lights on traveling at 65-70 MPH, along the highway.  It was hard for me to see exactly what these craft looked like because of the dark-sky and the objects were plusing off &amp; on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say that they didn&#39;t seem to be very big, and they seemed to be Cigar shaped vs Saucer shaped, much more rocket or missle-like.

They flew so close together it looked like they were towing each other or connected in some way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Spotlight beam.  No sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this same craft before.  I believe the first time I saw it was in July, &#39;03 around the same time (21:00.)  Both times I was out walking my dog when it appeared.  The first incident the craft came quite close--seemed to be hovering over my neighborhood.  The craft could go at different speeds and could be stationary.  This craft stopped in the sky and turned on what seemed to be a very bright spotlight beam.  Three lights were visible on the bottom of the craft at all times except when stationary.  It was capable of being unseen while it traveled away and then later appeared again with the lights back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure many people must have seen this because it was over the East Valley of Phoenix for some time.  I walked my dog and saw it, went back to the house, left in my car to drive to the gym about eight miles away and it was still visible in the night sky.  The most significant thing about the experience was the complete lack of sound from the aircraft-silent.  This was definately not any kind of a plane or helicopter.  I know what I saw.  I just wish I had a camera!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness describes self as a person who is involved in handling a considerable quantity detailed information.

8/19/03 05:15|Council Bluffs|IA|Unknown|3-4 min.|This craft appeared as though it was waiting to be inspected, but was so close I couldn't see it all.|10/15/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32161.html|283|ndxe200308| This craft appeared as though it was waiting to be inspected, but was so close I couldn&#39;t see it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving the company&#39;s 18 wheeler on I-29 just north of Council Bluffs, Ia., I saw something through the top right of the windshield that looked like an airliner (but too many lights), banking then dropping down ( about 1 mile out). When I looked back to the road briefly, I almost couldn&#39;t find it again but saw it hug the ground and cross to the interstate beyond the next overpass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I drove around a mild curve and went under the overpass, it was ahead of me about 1/4 mile over the ditch moving northbound as I was. I left my truck in cruise at 60mph. It only took a few seconds to catch up to it. It slowly picked up speed as I got nearer and when I was just up to the rear lights, It was traveling about 2mph slower than my 60mph, so I studied the craft the best I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The bottom of the craft was only about 20&#39;-25&#39; above the road surface to my right and the leftmost white light (1 of 3) was just to the right of the truck cab. What I could see clearly were three brilliant white circular disc shaped lights about 4&#39; in diameter forming an equilateral triangle about 4&#39;-6&#39; apart 2 leading and 1 trailing center. A single bright red circular disc of lights approximate 3&#39; in diameter located in the center of the 3 white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When approaching from the rear, I leaned forward to look up behind the lights, but couldn&#39;t see anything but black and a faint smoky or black misty wake like a boat would leave in water. It looked like it could have been following the underside of the craft, but I really couldn&#39;t tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The white lights were brilliant and looked like a hundred plus bulbs in a disc, but were too bright to see the light source, but they did not blind the eye when looking right at them. The light they gave off had a flood like appearance and lit the ground and the truck cab very well (about like hallogen). The red disc of light was bright red but did not glare as much and I could see what appeared to be maybe 30 or more bulbs. The actual count could be higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued to fall behind at the 2mph rate until it was well behind the trailer then slowed considerably as I continued at 60mph. When a mild hill and then another overpass came, I could still see the brilliant white light glowing upward in my mirror even though I was possibly a mile or so away and over the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was Tuesday, and I wasn&#39;t routed that way all the rest of that week. The following Sunday, I drove down there to investigate the area during daylight. The ditch in that area extends approximately 50&#39; over to a row of utility poles that are about 35&#39;-40&#39; in height all along the area this occurred. Since all during the event, I could not see the size or shape of the craft, this may help in some way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I didn&#39;t get the precise locations of these, however I noticed there are a few lines coming from the utility poles and crossing I-29 at various points and appear to be elevated only about 2/3 the way up these poles. Maybe that explains why the craft backed off when it did. I think it might have had to stay below radar or something. When I first saw it bank &amp; drop, it went over to I-29 almost hugging the ground and I think it may have dropped where Loess Hills protrudes upwards just east of the interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I forgot to mention the craft moved along like it was on rails, (not even a wobble or bump), nor did it have an angle of attack, (it was perfectly level). I couldn&#39;t roll down the right window (it isn&#39;t powered and it isn&#39;t safe to reach that far), but I had on an empty trailer and was on fairly flat ground and the motor wasn&#39;t real noisy, and I did not hear any noise from the craft over the moderate motor and tire noise of the truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded exceptionally credible to us.

I drove to the end of my street and stopped at the stop sign and was getting ready to turn right.  I checked the traffic to my left, and of course on a week day there wasn&#39;t a car in sight.  For some reason, I happened to look up slightly when I looked left and saw a triangular shape in the sky slightly above the tree top and maybe a one block distance from where I was.  The object was dark grey in color, no lights at all and was hovering motionless in the sky tilted slightly so that one point was lower than the other two, as if it were looking at something on the ground. It was the size of a private plane if the plane was in the same spot. I was sitting in my car so I rolled down the drivers side window because I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  The object never moved or made a sound the 5 plus minutes I sat there looking at it.  It&#39;s like my eyes were seeing this object but my brain wasn&#39;t registering what I was seeing.  I went down to gas up the car and on my way back I was searching the same part of the sky that I had seen the object.  I was only gone for 5 or 6 minutes but the thing was gone.  I sat in my car at the end of my street searching the sky in that area and did not see it anymore.  I drove down my street, parked the car and stood out in front of my house and didn&#39;t see anything else.  I was terrified because I usually go out in the very early morning hours and if I didn&#39;t look in that particular part of the sky that early morning I would not have seen it.  The color difference between the night sky and the craft was slight, and you would have had to look directly at it to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

These are some facts that Ken has left out,  the stretch of road he is referring to is only about 3 nautical miles off the end of the north and south runway at Eplley airfield in Omaha .Also this stretch of road is approximately 16 miles from Offfutt Airforce Base,  Which is one of the most air guarded Airforce bases in the United States ( this is where they hid President  George W Bush on 9/11/01), With these facts I realized anything at just about any altitude in this area would be covered by extensive radar by both Eppley and Offfutt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not calling Ken a liar, but like I had said his description was very much the same as I have seen on other occasions on the very exact same stretch of road, the difference being on one occasion I stopped my vehicle to get a better look and realized that a jet on gliding approach does not really make that much noise and on a dark night with their landing lights only shining on parts of the fuselage, gives it the appearance that it looks more like an  odd shaped disc and because of the brightness of the landing lights it makes the non illuminated parts of the airplane very hard to see,<n>

As i looked to the western night sky, i observed what at first thought to be a plane moving east to west, at incredable speed. My friend came outside, and i called him over to look, and then i noticed three more craft slightly south of the first object, all traveling in the same direction. The three that were together were in a triangle formation. All of the objects were as bright as a star, moving at least three times the speed of a normal jet aircraft.

BUT, At approx. 2100hrs, I was sitting in my living room watching tv. My son was in his bedroom, my wife in ours. When suddenly there was a loud roar, over our home, it traveled from north to south. The entire house rattled. I spent my life on airbases and work for uncle sam, this was not some transport. I am an aircraft nut, and could of identified the craft. IT did not have the same engine sound. This was a roar, not a hum of a turbine or a prop, or the thump of a rotor.  Everyone ran into the living room, while I was looking for a flashlight. Then out of no where, another one passed over. We ran outside, I thought a plane was going down. We looked and could hear it travel south, but could not see it. There was several small planes in the air. Today at work, I spoe to a co-worker, he lives about an hour south of us. The same &#34;aircraft&#34; passed over his home, minutes after mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It struck me that it was at an extremely high altitude and perfectly steady.  Then I immediately realized that the perfect diamond shape (like a playing card) was no bird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving along the short axis of the diamond.  The relative size was approximate to a pencil lead held at arms length.  The clarity of the outline gave me the impression that it was less than a mile altitude and under 80’ wide.   It seemed black with a reddish area in the center which was hard to determine against a bright blue, clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being somewhat of an aviation enthusiast I realized it was no aircraft I have ever been aware of.  This was confirmed by the complete silence that would have betrayed an airplane, helicopter or model plane.  The sharp shape and completely straight steady motion ruled out any special balloon or kite, especially on such a calm day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The rate of travel was about that of a private plane but still seemed un-airplane like in relation to the altitude.  Then it suddenly accelerated up to about double it’s original speed, much quicker than any fighter jet could change speed.  A half second later, while still clearly visible, it just disappeared or at least accelerated away faster than I could see it go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this seven second event, it traveled less than two hand widths at arms length through the sky.  Luckily, I was so captivated that I didn&#39;t think of reaching for the binoculars or camera or pointing it out to my girlfriend.  Had I tried, I would have missed the disappearing act.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Now looking towards the southwest the one witness observed a long, silver point of light. He said it would have been approx the size of a key at arms length. The witness thought it may have been a reflection of an airplane as that was his first thoughts, but he just took his eyes off it for a split second, and when he looked back up at it, it was gone. (He said nothing at this point to his friend)  The two men kept eating their lunch and a few seconds later the witnesses friend said, quick look over there, the friend now caught something with his eyes. When the witness turned to look at what his friend was pointing at, the object had vanished. His friend said it disappeared so quickly, and he said it just faded out into the blue sky. When the friend saw the object he said it was the size of a nickel at arms length. Both men reported seeing it coming from the west and in a few seconds it was in the east, the size of a nickel. They reported the color as being a metallic silver, and at the end of the sighting the friend said it looked just like a sphere in shape.

He watched a small ball of white light cross the highway in the distance a head of him, the ball of light turned in his direction. The witness said he was doing approametly 30 kilometers an hour and observed the light getting closer. All of a sudden the object stopped, still a ways away from him, there it had changed from a ball of light into a craft of some type. He made a guess as to what the altitude of the object might have been at. The witness told me it may have been traveling at approx: 1000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He added that before the object changed from a ball of light into a strange craft, he noted that it started glistening and shinning brightly and then this is when it started taking on some kind of form of an unusual object. He reported no sound being heard, mind you he was in his vehicle at the time. I also asked if he might be able to determine the size of it, he said when it was in the distance it could have been approx: the size of his small fingers, fingernail. But when it headed in his direction and got very close,  in his words, &#34;it was huge.&#34;  The object did come to a complete stop as the man passed close by. It sat stationary as he drove some 2 kilometers doing around 20 kilometers an hour. Finally other drivers started honking their horns to get his attention to have him speed up. The man said the reason why he was driving so slow was due to him looking over his shoulder and out the back window watching it.

My friend looked up into the sky, and his jaw dropped.  I turned around and looked up to see what he was looking at.  I could clearly see the black silhouette of a saucer against the orange glow of the night sky.  It was a slightly cloudy night which, sometimes caused the sky to be orange at night rather than black.  Anyways, this disk had 3 flashing lights on the bottom, but each time one of the lights flashed the light was a different color.  The Disc also appeared to be flying fairly low, being that we saw it against the clouds from below supports this.  The really strange thing is that neither of us heard a thing, not the whine of a jet engine, or pulsing of a helicopter rotor, so it definately was not a plane or a helicopter.  My friend and I couldn&#39;t help but watch as this object silently flew out of site in a matter of minutes, and being in Saskatchewan it had to go a long way before it is out of site.  Neither of us had ever seen anything like it before, but this incident has opened our eyes, and we are now constatly glancing up at the sky for another glimpse.  Now I am not sure if this is the absolutely correct date, i know it was a sunday night during mid-late august.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was stationary for a little over an hour. It would change from dim to bright. The color was a dull yellow. It was a clear night. Tried to report this after observing, but server was down for a long time. I took picture&#39;s of it. I called my wife and mother-in-law outside, they observed the same thing. No sound could be heard from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were both looking at this are when we both saw a light the size and intensity of an average star wink on for about 1/4 to 1/2 a second and then wink off.  It reminded me of a lightning bug.  We asked each other if we had seen it, and confirmed it.  We kept looking at the same area and saw it again.  I then began counting and found that it winked on in regular cycles of 29-30 seconds.  It slowly moved its way northwest down the sky toward the horizon.  We watched it go toward the horizon for an hour and a half, when we lost it in the glow of northern lights just above the tree tops.  The flashing light grew fainter as it progressed down the sky, until it was visible only by means of my field glasses, which I had run inside to get.  The light was white and had no other color to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 22:30 (or 1/2 hour into the sighting), both my wife and I saw off and to the side of the light we were tracking a second light wink on and wink off, as bright as a bright star.  But it did not continue to blink, just that once.  We kept tracking the original blinking star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I showed it to my wife and we observed it together. The shape appeared to be like a cylinder with the center part being narrower than the extremities. The object was about half an inch if I would size it with my fingers and had a solid white color with no visible wings and was flying East very fast and silently. There was no trail. I was trying to identify the object but could not. The speed and the shape appeared out of the ordinary. Was it a missile?   The object crossed half the sky where I started to see it to a cloud far away in 15 seconds. I was hearing a little bit the waves of the beach in the background and I thought this could cover the sound of the reactor if there was one. But the speed Between the position when I first spot it and the cloud, I estimate conservatively the distance to be about 5 miles. Five miles in 15 seconds is appreciatively 1700 per second!  When I finally realized the strangeness of this object, I tried to take a picture but the object was already too far and too small to be seen through the screen of my digital camera.<n>

I turned around and looked up to where she was pointing.  I saw a cigar shaped U.F.O.  It was not moving at all.  It was shiney aluminum like it was brand new.  It had windows, but I couldn&#39;t see how many because one of my trees covered part of it.  It looked like it should fall out of the sky by lack of motion. We viewed it for about 15-20 seconds.  I looked over at my wife to see her expression on her face and back looked at the U.F.O.  In that time it took to do that the U.F.O. disappeared.  I wish I had my camera because against the clear blue sky it would have really stood out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live on Rose Hill in Kirkland, with a clear view of the south. The sky was blue and clear, light wind, no clouds in that direction. She was ready to do a Reiki treatment for me. Right when I laid on the table, facing south, I looked up and saw an object moving slowly from W to E. Then it stopped. I asked my friend what this was. She saw the same thing. We looked at it for approx 3 minutes. In that time, it didn&#39;t move. No markings, no sound. We don&#39;t think it was an airplane or copter, and it didn&#39;t behave the way a balloon behaves. It appeared white and almost perfectly round. The sky was clear and there was no glare. It was close enough that we could watch it, knew it was something solid, but finally had to continue our session and took our eyes off it. We have no idea what it was, but have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be at about 1,000 feet or so and then moved farther up into the sky. Keep in mind that this was in the morning and almost no clouds. The light moved farther up in the sky and then I saw two such lights. They seemed to be very high. I called my wife to come out of the house to see the lights. Once she came out, we saw another light in a different part of the sky and it appeared to be very high, although it was impossible to tell. The reason is that we could not make out any shape, it was just a light in the blue sky. That light began to move across the sky at a fast rate of speed and moved behind the house roof. Very strange! I have never seem anything like it until I saw the pictures of such exact lights on the rense.com website. Here is the link. They looked exactly like these pictures-I would like to know if anyone else saw these lights. http://www.rense.com/general40/phoenix.htm<n>

The windows were half open and pushed out like shutters, perpendicular to the building, so I could see reflections in the window panes.  I was facing the mirror,  East, when I noticed a light out of the corner of my right eye.  My mind computed that I was seeing the moon reflected in the window, so I turned to check out the moon.  Instead I saw two lights in the distance, one heading West, the other heading East.  It took my mind a couple of seconds to understand what I was seeing.  I remember clearly thinking that I was seeing an airplane heading West on its descent to LAX, and also seeing it&#39;s reflection in the window, because they were heading right for each other.  But a second later I realized I wasn&#39;t, that I was watching two real, separate lights heading towards each other, one from the West, the other from the East.  My heart immediately started racing as it dawned on me that I might be witnessing an in air collision.  But after a few tense seconds the lights passed each other and I was relieved.  Until the light heading East stopped, held its position for a second, and flew away arcing due South.  It was completely gone in under two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

(Not related to the lights outside)  As I looked out the window I noticed the changing color and hovering of the first set of three lights.  The lights caught my attention as they flickered, and figured it was an airplane going from Beale to Travis.  The only difference was that the lights did not move as an airplane would.  I had time to go get my binoculars and with them made out the first of three distinguishable lights.  I then realized that there were actually three sets of three hovering lights.  I thought it must be three airplanes headed towards the south because the lights were so similar to airplane lights. With a change in color as the lights lit up from one of the three lights to another of the three lights.  It probably was just airplanes.  The only odd thing was they didn&#39;t seem to be moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went outside to get a better look but was unable to focus the binoculars on them enough to see much else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The one on top appeared to wobble slightly, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I stared a little longer, the second object wobbled too. I went out to the front of my house to get a better angle away from my citrus trees.  I had a clear line of sight from my driveway.  The objects now wobbled together and one circled around the other, stop, do it again, this went on for about 45 seconds, then both began climbing rapidly westward, the one on top first, followed almost immediately by the other. At times when the two were briefly very close to each other, they seemed to form an upside down V shape, (but the haze was constantly changing shape as the objects moved,so the V shape might just be a subcouncious fabrication) There were starlike objects moving randomly within the balls of haze, at least two or three within each one. As they traveled upwards they got smaller, they circled around each other, clockwise and counterclockwise, stop, wobble and travel together again. I screamed/called my neighbor to grab his eyeglasses and come outside and tell me I wasn&#39;t imagining the whole thing. By the time he came out the objects were at about 80 degrees in the sky and much smaller, he confirmed two of them, the mist/haze appearance and the odd wobbling and circling behavior, as well as the rate of speed, we stood there for about 5 minutes until he couldn&#39;t see them anymore.  I myself having 20/20 vision observed the two objects for about 5 more minutes at about 88 degrees, barely visible, still circling each other, star like objects appeared to travel in and out and away from the haze.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My brother was going home after he visited me and my family for the day.  I saw him to his car and talked to him for a couple of minutes.  We were then distracted by green lights overhead.  The vehicles were about 100 feet high.  These objects were moving east at a velocity of 10 mph.  There were six of these objects and were all traveling together.  Some of these objects were moving erratically left and right but were all staying pretty much in formation.  Two teenager ran towards us from the left in excitement screaming what the hell are those!!?!  My brother and I did not say anything for abut twenty seconds as we were in awe.  I then told them that they looked like green glowing eggs, and one of the kids said, they are definitely not airplanes, not helicopters, their not even making any noise.  A blonde girl around 22 joined us and began watching them as well.  She was speechless.  Then a car pulled up and a 30 year old woman asked what we were looking at, we said we have no idea.  Six green egg shaped objects just flew over our heads and you can still see them right next to the tree on the left.  She said, *I See them,&#34; and her son said I see them too!!!!  We stood there for another 3 or 4 minutes until they just disappeared.  Ten minutes later, my brother and I saw another object fly quickly over our heads but this one was flashing a blue light.  We saw its outline as it passed overhead between us and the white cumulus clouds above.  The object was black and shaped like a disk with a very bright blue flashing light underneath.  It continued towards the east for about 400 meters then made a sharp left turn and disappeared.  That is all I can say, that is what we perceived.  Can you tell me what it was?  Did the air force pick up anything on radar at this time?  Let me know!  Thank You ((name deleted))<n>

I was travelling up tower hill road in Narragansett. I noticed a light in the sky at my left.  I was fixated on this object for about a minute or two while I was at a red light.  As the light turned green, I noticed to my right that there was a gold jaguar on my right waiting for me to pass.  I proceeded to go past the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed that it was a diamond shape. It was jet black like the night, and it had an orange yellowish aura around it.  As I passed it I was staring at it while I was driving, it must have been less than 200 feet in the air. I noticed as I drove by there was someone behind me flashing there light’s at me to get me to pull over.  I was really excited about seeing this object in the air. I said to myself I knew there was something out there.  My uncle renato niccolai from France saw one about 30 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It landed in his garden and then took off.  I have always been fascinated by this subject since I was a little kid. As I drove by I felt excited and then I felt very afraid of what I was witnessing. I have never felt those emotions at the same time.  It was intense. I didn’t stop and get out of my car as I was confused about what it was.  I think about it all the time now. I wish I had some proof, but unfortunately I don’t. If you could ever find this guy from Rhode Island with a gold jaguar somehow. I’m sure He would tell you the same story If not more. He had stopped to look at the object. I continued driving..<n>

We noted that the three lights formed a triangle and comprised a single object because as it slowly and steadily traversed the sky it blocked out the view of the stars.  We became entranced by it, especially because periodically it would literally make 90 degree left and right turns without slowing down or banking, something which to me seems impossible.  It&#39;s path originated from the southeast initially heading northwest, as we were laying in my hammock facing north.  Periodically it would stop and hover motionless, and ultimately darted off at a high rate of spead in a southerly direction.  This occurred in August 2003 and since then, every August when the Perseids come, my kids recall the event and tell their friends.  I&#39;d like to know if anyone else in San Diego witnessed what we saw or can provide me with information about what we witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

8/16/03 23:00|Seaside|OR|Light|approximate: 5 seconds|Twin objects race across the sky in an unusal criss-cross pattern in an exciting sighting at the Oregon coast!|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30786.html|322|ndxe200308| Twin objects race across the sky in an unusal criss-cross pattern in an exciting sighting at the Oregon coast!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday August 16th we were on the beach in Seaside Oregon star gazing. We had stayed out after watching a beautiful sunset and sitting in our sand chairs with perfect weather and an enjoyable evening. Sometime after 10:00 PM we both spotted what I would call a Fast-Walker, moving from south to north in a rapid long hopping or pulsing movement. Possibly with a reddish glow to it, brightening and dimming as it pulses forward through the sky. These are very fast and you can count four or five pulses as they skip across the sky in a matter of seconds and the they are gone from view. We actually saw two of these within an hour moving in a northernly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Those were exciting and I had seen one once before but what we saw at approximately 11:00 PM really excited me! I pointed and yelled out UFO, UFO, as these two objects raced across the sky in a very unusal pattern. There was no doubt that these were very annomalus. There were two objects which my wife says were gray lights. I have trouble with colors and take her word for the color. All I can say is that there were two lights and that they were speeding north paralell to each other and appeared two come together and criss-cross each others path four to five times in a steady rythm as they rapiddly sped north from the south along the Oregon coast. Kind of hard to explain a sighting that only lasted about 5 seconds and I probably wouldn&#39;t have reported just a fast moving light in the sky like a pulsing Fast-Walker that allmost seems to be common, but these twin objects or lights were extraordinary. They appeared to be lower than the other objects we had seen. Yet very high with no known noise or visible trail associated with them and what struck me as almost a playful flight pattern, zipping in and out of each others path as they streaked along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is possible that they were not criss-crossing but mearly appeared to come together and then part in a repeated pattern as they raced across the sky, but it was my impression that they were criss-crossing and traveling extremely fast in a very exciting, annomalous sighting. There were over 50 people on the beach and about seven campfires as we did a rough head count of the activities around us as we stayed out untill about midnight on this perfect summer evening on the beach. I don&#39;t believe anyone else heard me or looked up soon enough when I shouted UFO, UFO, probably muffled by the ocean surf and distance on the wide beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Within minutes to half an hour, I was sitting with someone and talking on a pool ledge. We both had seen a couple shooting stars earlier, very faint, far and normal, however..... facing north from Tropicana, and VERY close, we saw a bright white ball of streak heading straight down lasting for 2 seconds and then it turned green for another 2 seconds and it went out of view behind the house, but right after it cleared the rooftop, we saw a light of explosion (circular afterglow) just beneath the horizon of the rooftop, obstructing our view of the explosion. It seemed SO very closeby, it had to be within city limits or on the south side of town. It was big because the streak was wide. The thing disappearing from our view (back of the house) but still falling gives you a sense of how close this fireball came to the ground. I asked people the next day (on Sun) if they saw it too but no avail, and I missed the news......<n> <n><n> <n><n> IF YOU HAVE SEEN THIS EVENT PLEASE CONTACT ME. I cant find it anywhere in the news or paper. Thanks very much.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Ahead of us the traffic started slowing down.  All of a sudden three lights popped over the field to the east of us and swooped overhead.  We were all looking at this object (I say an object because the lights seemed fixed to something but we couldn&#39;t see any structure - once I thought I saw a long pole-like boom heading to one of the lights, but I can&#39;t be sure) as we, it and the rest of the traffic moved south at 45-50 miles per hour.  It bounced up and down, looked like it landed in a field to the west of us, then zoomed back over the interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a crop duster, although it was very dark to be spraying.  But the object didn&#39;t follow any field pattern I know of, nor did I see any cloud of pesticide ejected from the object which I believe would leave a haze that would fog the lights from the farm houses in the distance.  Those lights stayed crystal clear.  Also, the object would speed up ahead of us then return along the interstate.  My wife thought it might be a small plane or ultrlight in distress, but the object didn&#39;t have any colored wing lights, just three very intense white beams one of which disappeared every so often (I think the bulk of the object blocked the far light at these times, but I have no special reason to think so).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object stayed around the highway for a few minutes, then rushed off to the east.  It seemed to have set down in a field about 1/4 mile behind us.  As I was in the backseat, I kept watching it wondering what it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appear once more well behind our car and moved west over the interstate a minute or so later.  We were well away from it; I could only see the lights as dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us heard any noise although we could easily hear car engines and crickets (as we discovered later) while moving at speed.  The radio wasn&#39;t on.  When I asked what size they thought the object was, three of us felt the craft couldn&#39;t have been more than 20 feet long (my wife and mother compared it to the size of a large car).  My father thought it was relatively large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (As an amateur astronomer, I know that appearent dimensions get funny at night.  So I gave my parents a test to help them visualize the size of the object (my wife already knows this test).  I asked them to compare the object to the full moon.  Then I asked them which coin is roughly the size of the full moon when held at arm&#39;s length.  My mom thought the object was much larger than the full moon, say about 8 to ten disks wide, and correctly said a dime is roughly the disk of the moon.  My father didn&#39;t give me an estimation, but incorrectly believed a quarter matches the appearent diameter of the moon.)  We figured the object never went very high above us and estimated the closest approach to be about 500 feet to the west and less than 100 feet above from the appearent height of the power lines running along the highway and the height of the crops it disappeared into.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I are teachers (she&#39;s a pre-school teacher and head after-school teacher; I&#39;m a middle school science and math teacher).  My mother just retired from teaching 5th grade for 37 years.  My dad retired from brokering steel.  I noted the time from the clock radio in the car and the inital distance from a mileage sign to Bakersfield.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were just hanging out enjoying the cool night. I walked out to the driveway and a light caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. I looked up (toward the East) and saw this very bright, deep, orange/red light flying very very fast through the sky. As it flew it zig zagged. I screamed for everyone to come look. For about 15-20 minutes we watched this light zig zag, go straight up at a high rate of speed, go straight down at a high rate of speed, go side to side, get real bright then very dim. I&#39;m not good at guessing miles, but those with me guessed it was about 5 miles away. It was really amazing and we have no idea what it could have been.  It was sooo fast and moved incredibly.  All together there were six witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was flying at the speed a plane would, streight from left to right on the horizon-line/tree-line, and then just as it was about to escape from view it began moving downward.  This was either a ufo, or the biggest/low-flying plane I have ever seen(Im talking aircraftcarrier size).  My eyes could not see anything but a large GREY cylinder, and considering how long i watched it for, i would have thought I would see tailfins or and indication that it had wings, but i saw no such things.  I later realized that i heard no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do you know of any huge low flying aircraft that is of a dark blue/grey color,specificaly civilian aircraft(would be most likely because i live near a small airport),?e-mail me. I am very curious and want to understand what i saw, because it seemed too HUGE, low-flying, and dark colored to be plane,(no wings or tail fin apparent unlike any other large plane i have ever seen during daylight hours). to measure what my eyes saw, it was no doubt quite far away(few miles), yet its thickness was about 1/2 to 3/4 cm, and one inch long.  I thought I was going to come home from my hike and hear about this, or atleast a terrorist attack or something.  I was definately weirded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also when it became dark out I saw lights in the sky, if they were planes, they turned off all their lights after changing direction or acting just as a plane would.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, the object looked like a dark dot in the sky and was too high to determine what it was even with my low-powered binoculars. Initially, I dismissed it a cluster of balloons set adrift. But then I noticed that the object was stationary which was unusual especially at this altitude. At times, it would sway back and forth to show that the object had an irregular shape. As it swayed, a lighter shade of color could be seen on its body. It was my wife&#39;s opinion that it was not balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some ten minutes, the object slowly started drifting through the sky. During this period, a small non-commercial plane, at an altitude of several hundred feet flew by between us and the object. The object stopped once again after traversing what I think were miles. We were still unable to determine what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my son&#39;s friend alerted us to two more similar objects further out in the horizon. One of the objects slowly drifted to our direction but still not close enough to determine what it was. At about 5:40, all three objects could seen, stationary and distanced from each other by miles of blue skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, my attention was drawn back to our backyard activities. By 6:00, as we turned our attention back to the skies, we could no longer see the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Peter Davenport requested that I re-send my report and have it posted on the 8/16/03 &#34;Three Dark Objects&#34; entry from Houston, Texas. Here is my report:  While enjoying a sunny afternoon in our backyard swimming pool in southeast Houston near Pasadena, others and I witnessed up to three unidentified, dark objects for a sustained amount of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our experience started in late afternoon (between 4:00 &amp; 5:00) when our neighbor&#39;s 10-year old daughter looked up in a mostly sunny and clear sky to see a dark, round-looking object. My 9-year old son, wife and I also saw the object. It was too far away to determine what it what. At first, I thought it to be a small cluster of balloons set adrift. But I noticed that it was stationary, which would seem unusual for free floating balloons at this altitude. Even after viewing the object with low-powered binoculars, I was unable to determine what it was. With my binoculars, though, I was able to notice that it was not completely round and had a irregular shape to it. Though the object was not moving, it swayed occasionally from side to side to show that portions of its body had a lighter color on it. During our sighting, a small-engined airplane flying at a low altitude of 200-300 feet went across our viewing area of the object. The mysterious object looked like it was far higher than the plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing the object being stationary for about ten minutes, it slowly moved across the sky, still unable to determine what it was. Once again, it stopped. Several minutes later, my neighbor&#39;s daughter pointed out two other dark objects stationed further away from us. They seemed to show the same characteristics of the first object. The latter two objects appeared to be miles apart from each other and eventually made slow movement toward us and the first object. Into 30 minutes of this usually sighting, the first object once again moved slowly across the sky and stopped. The three objects never got close to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In time, my attention returned to our backyard activities. 45 minutes after seeing the first object I looked up to the skies and could no longer locate the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife also has no explanation to what she saw that afternoon with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He approaches me and asks &#34;What are those things?&#34; I looked up and saw nothing. The sky was clear except for some high thin clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked him where and he points up to the high cloud and says &#34;they are in the cloud ,then they come out.&#34; I looked for about 2-3 minutes then spot 4 shapes that were higher than the clouds. They were nearly exactly vertical from our position on the ground.  They  looked like the USAF insignia without the star in the middle. (The =0= insignia on all Air Force aircraft.) The moved slowly and moved into a V formation. One minute later a 5th object appeared , it also moved into the formation then moved to the left of the rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another appeared and finally a 7th object came into sight. Four lined up in the attack formation, while the other 3 moved spread out to a sentry position from the other four.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were observing the objects 2 boys asked us what were we looking at, we told them we were looking at something strange. They looked up and after approximately three minutes of searching, they also observed the objects. Once, one of the objects changed from a silvery color to a velvet-blue color than back to silver. The life guards also entered the search but could not spot the objects. They were higher than 30,000 feet as later I spotted a DC-10 at cruising speed and it was below the clouds. The sighting was over at 1615 hrs with only 3 boys ages 10-12 and myself being the only witnesses. I am 37 years old and a former USAF Sgt. These objects looked like tiny satellites with thier solar panels extended, and they were flying in formations familiar to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to have the other witnesses submit reports, as well.

Circa 0500 on Saturday 16 August 2003 I was picking up a loaded trailer from a warehouse at McClellan AFB / Industrial Park in northeast Sacramento, California.  At the time it was still dark, there were no other persons or traffic observed inside McClellan, and the industrial parking lot area where this happened was very well lit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had picked up my load and was driving out slowly when I noticed an unexpected light formation in my left mirror.  I watched for a short time.  I am accustomed to commercial airline traffic from Sacramento International, and the now sparse military traffic into and over McClellan.  This one caught my attention because it was on the wrong course for normal traffic out of SAC, the wrong time of day for traffic into McClellan, and too low and slow and too bright.  It was unusual enough that I stopped the truck, shut down the engine, and got out to have a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft or UFO approached from NW, bearing est. 315 degrees, directly for McClellan.  This is east and north of normal flight paths for departing traffic out of SAC.  It was also too low for departing SAC traffic, and not climbing.  As it approached, I could see that it was low, est. altitude no more than 1,000-1,500 feet, and slow, est. speed about 100 kts.  It approached and made a button-hook turn south, then east, then est. due north, over the south part of McClellan, with a turn radius est. 1/2 mile, then departed est. due north until it was out of sight without climbing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While over McClellan it was for approximately 30 seconds sufficiently well lit by the parking lot lighting to get a good clear look.  The AC/UFO was a flying wing - no fuselage, no empennage.  The wings were swept at an angle of 90 degrees at the apex, and very long, est. 200-300 feet, with a high aspect ratio.  Near the tip of each wing were two very bright white lights shining directly down, and at the apex were two very bright white lights shining directly down, one of each pair near the leading edge, one near the trailing edge.  There were no position lights visible (green and red on right and left wing tips, respectively, red and white at tail - since there was no tail), which I believe conclusively proves that this was not an &#34;ordinary&#34; AC, since all are required to display position lights at all times (except military ops in restricted airspace).  There were no strobe lights, and the visible lights were not landing lights, since they pointed straight down, not forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was enough ambient light from the very bright parking lot industrial lighting, and the AC/UFO was low enough, that the underside of the wings could be clearly seen to be either white, or light gray or light blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The AC/UFO flew nearly directly overhead, at a straightline distance of no more than est. 1,500 feet from where I stood, and was silent - or at least inaudible at 1,500 feet.  No engine noise of any kind.  Definitely not a helicopter!  My hearing is very good, my vision is 20/15 as of my last physical, June 2003.  Total time of observation est. 3-4 minutes.  When I got back in the truck the clock time was 0506.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter<n> <n><n> <n><n> Didn&#39;t share with anyone there, just several friends.  McClellan is decomissioned and is now an industrial park, the only remaining military activity is a clinic and civilian contractor aircraft maintenance.  Nobody else around as far as I could tell while I was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an interesting siting.  I have a private pilot&#39;s license, and have been an airplane watcher as long as I can remember.  It didn&#39;t take long to realize that this was something I hadn&#39;t seen before.  Whether it was a &#34;real&#34; ET UFO, or a classified military or experimental type, I have no way of knowing.  But big, slow, and silent, without position lights, and on an unusual flight path, sure got my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

As  it  passed  the  moon , it  doubled  its  speed  and  changed  course  in  a  due  south  direction  towards  Orange  County . After  confirming  with  NOAA  that  the  upper  and  surface  wind  flows  were  in  a  southeasterly  to  northwesterly  direction , the  object  defied  the  predominant  airflow , thus  making  obvious  theoretical deductions . In  addition , confirmation  with  Navy  and  Air  Force (Vandenberg AFB) proved  no  exercises  were  enacted  this  particular  evening . Thank  You .<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I do not want notarity. I am a 57 year old professional engineer and after years of looking at the night sky I have never before seen anything that I would describe as a ufo or any other object similar to what I saw up close in August. I do not remember the exact date, but it was an unusually clear and moonless night. We live in the foothills east of Seattle in an area sheltered from city light. I went out in the yard and was laying on a blanket watching for meteorites during a period of expected meteor showers. It was quiet except for the sounds of owls in the woods. After about half an hour I noticed something approaching very fast, very low and blocking out the stars to the east in my peripheral vision. As I looked upward, a large boom-a rang shaped object passed overhead at an altitude I would estimate as 500 to 1000 feet. It had no lights, absolutely no sound and seemed to be traveling at a supersonic speed without any accompanying sonic boom. I remember saying out loud &#34;What the...&#34; at which time a cargo bay or some opening on the bottom center of the object lit up with a blueish white light. I could see visible framework in the rounded front, rectangular opening. Just as quickly, the light went out. It had lit up for perhaps three seconds. Within two more seconds the object disappeared over the foothills to the west. It had passed from horizon to horizon in perhaps six seconds. Again it was extremely low, had no navagation lights and absolutely no sound. We have jet aircraft pass over our home in the day. NOTHING travels as fast as what I saw that night. My own wife scoffs at my story and says it must have been a meteor. It wasn&#39;t. I have not and do not intend to tell this story to anyone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He doesn&#39;t remember if they were flashing, but he is certain there were two lights and they were very close together. They moved due west very quickly, then he saw them change direction and head back due east. After passing to the east of the point where he first observed them, they headed toward the north. The lights stayed the same distance apart the whole time. Their speed was what caught his eye. The total sighting was less than a minute, about 17-20 seconds. They were very small, about the size of a grain of corn (or smaller) held at arm&#39;s length. They were about 3/4 of the way up from the horizon. No sound. An airplane was in the vicinity near the time of the sighting but he can&#39;t remember if it was before or afterward.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was observing the Ring Nebula in Lyra with my 8&#34; Orion reflector telescope and as I looked up at the sky I saw a very slow moving object heading east to west. I first spotted it coming from the Northern Cross and followed it across the sky till it disapppeared over the western horizon. My best view of it was in the Constellation Hercules. The object was Cylinder shaped, dark gray or black finish. I saw no reflection or any lights on it. I am guessing at altitude but would say about 1500 ft. I did not see any wings, tail fins or engine pods and it was silent. My first thought was that it was a blimp but ruled that out. Not sure of length but appeared larger than the Goodyear Blimp  I don&#39;t consider myself an amateur astronomer, but have been observing the night sky  since I was in High School( over 40 years).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting by astronomer.

It sounded like a Kawasaki motor cycle reved to about 15,000+ RPM&#39;s!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up to see if I could spot it but saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound lasted only about 15 sec then was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day one of the farm hands came by and told me some local kids were riding their dirt bikes in the gravel pit when they saw a craft take off out of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked him if it was at about 8:30 last night and he said yes it was.  I told him I heard the thing take off. He asked me if it would be alright if the kids came back there to talk to me about it because they thought they were nuts.  I told him it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The kids stopped by and told me what it looked like.  They said it looked like a barbell or two vertically positioned disks with a tube between connecting the disks.  I guess it looked like Darth Vader&#39;s fighter craft (!) which seems very odd indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I took a walk down to the gravel pit to see if there were any marks on he ground.  I found an odd looking depression in the gravel.  It was conical like you would expect as if someone had removed some ground in gravel and the sides caved in to form a cone shape but, there was no sign of the removed dirt nearby!  It was as if something was extracted from underneath and the gravel settled back down into to the space below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are some strange goings ons at this gravel pit during years of near Earth/Mars approaches as during my report of 1977.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to note that this year 2003 was a near pass year between Earth and Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked up at a jet which was very high, heading SSW. The bay was to my right. I saw a craft very much higher, traverse the skydome , aboue a third of the sky was witnessed by me. The appearance and motion of the loftier craft was very reminiscent of shots from the shuttle of anomalous lights in the lower atmosphere. There seemed to be a &#34;pulse&#34; effect. It was moving so quickly that the speed must have been way beyond anything which our air forces have, anything I am aware of anyway. It was a &#34;pure luck&#34; deal. And if I had not been interested in such occurances, I certainly would never have noticed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes himself as someone who is quite familiar with photography and complex operations.

She hollared over to me and her best friend (11 years young) to look at something weird. We took the few steps down the back porch to get the view she had. She was aprox. Instantly we noticed the strange craft. It was a charcoal colored disk with a center that was shining. The color of the light was a whiteish/blue and simliar to the color of electricity. This craft was...guesstimating here....about the size of a larger helicopter. It seemed to fly at a slow speed. I would compare it to a car going 30 mph. I have no idea as to how high up it was. Again, I&#39;ll compare it to something familiar. We often have medivacs cruise thru here everyday or so. They seem to be heading to Seattle or out to the VA hospital area (Fort Lewis). Well, I&#39;d say that this craft flew a little higher than theses helicopters. It made no sound and was in no hurry. I checked the wind direction to decide if it was being blown but it was not the wind doing this. It was moving in a straight direction towards Puyallup Valley area which is aprox 5 miles from my Eastside neighborhood. I feel foolish now for mocking all of those silly spaceship/UFO shows from the 50&#39;s/60&#39;s. It didn&#39;t look like a man made object. The way it moved was unlike anything I&#39;ve seen. And the shiney light, (probably blinding if you were 500 feet or so closer), seemed to be an energy source. Perhaps the sun? It also seemed to be reflecting the sun and maybe that reflection is maybe why it seemed so shiney and  the color of lightning. To my shock, this darned thing was a flying saucer. No way!<n>

I was trying to think of what these lights were, my friend was really having a good look too - I asked him what he was looking at, he replied, lights - I don&#39;t know. We pulled over the side of the road and pulled the sun roof back; by this time we noticed that these objects were not lights but some type of craft that were now alongside each other slowly hovering above us, they looked quite large and a glistening orange colour, we stopped the car engine to see if we could here something. These craft made no sound at all, they weren&#39;t far from us and were obviously having no concern of being seen as they were quite easily located and noticeable. My 15 yr old daughter and her friend were very excited about it, my friend and I were simply trying to identify what type of craft these could be, though unable to come up with anything. After a good 10 minutes of the craft hovering above our area and slowly moving North, one of the craft made a 90 deg turn to the left and proceeded to fly West / inland. We watched in amazement as they got further away; I then remembered to quickly grab my camera from the car and take a couple of photos, though they were quite a distance away by then. My camera is only a cheap digital camera though one of the photos has succeeded; though I am unsure if the craft took off quickly - or I moved when taking the photo as the light looks like a serated line on a black night sky - it doesn&#39;t look a very convincing photo to me, though - not being of any interest of UFO&#39;s or there reports in the past, I certainly have changed my attitude on what is seen in our skys; these were inexplicable craft. As we all hopped in the car to go, the street light which we were parked under suddenly went out for about 1 minute before coming back on again; wether this had any significance to the craft, we dont know. I phoned the Williamstown RAAF Base (about 20 mins drive) the next morning to ask if th! ere were any domestic or military craft in this area at that time, there response was no, and they gave me a phone number for reporting sightings to. We are yet to discuss with these authorities on the matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It truly was a very clear and distinct viewing of these craft, we only wish the city / town folk were out and about like us to be able to see this phenomena as it was most amazing. We were unable to come up with any suggestions or eliminations to disprove our UFO thoughts. We all feel extremely fortunate to have experienced such a thing and only hope to some day experience it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to correspond with this witness, in order to request permission to look at the photograph allegedly captured of the objects, but his e-address was invalid.

It was approx. 12.20 on a Friday night.  Above the adjacent town home I saw two glowing lights, they were in formation headed South, I believe.  They moved at a rather slow pace considering.  Within their formation they seemed to be moving independently as well, in an erratic, but quick short manner.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen.  They were circular, and they glowed, with a luminous type light. They were moving with a motive.  I was mesmerized and then my fiancée said look, there are three more. They were following the first two lights.  They seemed to be in formation as well, never leaving their positions.  Within their position they seemed to be formation with the first two, but &#34;zig zagging in the same erratic way.  If I had to guess the speed, I would have to say they were moving about 30-40 miles per hour.  They were inclining slowly over the row of town homes we reside in. But it was a slow and gradual incline. There was absolutely no sound what so ever.  I don&#39;t believe they were perfectly round.  We didn&#39;t see any type of shadow or background behind the lights to suggest space ship.  But it was unlike anything any of us have ever seen.  The movement, the glowing lights, the formations, the erratic movement made independently, al suggested to all of us immediately we were definitely observing something amazing and not of this planet. We are all in our 30&#39;s, with predominant careers.  Two of us are realist, but spiritualist as well. Two of us skeptics by nature, until this amazing experience. We are all very well educated, in addition to group and individual continuous education. We  all believe in the evolution of intelligence. Two of us have had previous experiences and sightings.  Since this experience we have shared with many, and have been told amazing stories as well.  Each experience shared with us has had one thing in common, and that is the fact they never shared their experience with anyone else. They kept q! uite, until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We waited outside in anticipation of seeing additional sightings. We all kept saying the same thing, &#34; what the hell was that&#34;, over and over again. All of us agreeing, it was not of this planet. All of us in amazement, but at the same time, fearful. My neighborhood is filled with military families, of all types. I am informing you of this because of what followed about 30-40 minutes later. A very big, military helicopter began flying above the area we last saw the &#34;UFO&#39;s.  And it was definitely military. It was huge.  It was long and with very few lights, except for in the back.  It was searching for something in the sky, because it did not use a spot light.  They looked like the black hawk down helicopter.  It began searching in a circular manner, and slowly widened the diameter of it&#39;s area, as well as gradually inclining.  If I had to guess, I would say it searched for about 45 minutes to an hour.  In a distance we could hear an additional helicopter.  Our view was blocked by our limited view, we were on the back deck.  WE didn&#39;t feel anything a far as energy, or  the climate nor the sky. Our bodies nor our minds were altered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was simply amazing!  We all discussed it, and continue to do so.  We all had the same thought as we watched. Can it see us, and if so, does it know we can see it? I would like know if there were other sightings that night in our area.  Please do me this courtesy and reply.  My e-mail is PamelaJWatkins@aol.com.  I would also like to know how and where this information will be documented.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure you know my address, and will compile information on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What now?<n>

On the night of the blackout I noticed a strange object hovering over the darkened Manhattan skyline. It appeared to be round and silver colored (very bright). Red lights were revolving around it on what looked like a &#39;ring&#39;. These revolving red lights were what got my attention. They rotated &amp; flashed on the &#39;ring&#39; non-stop. The travel path of the red lights convinced me I wasn&#39;t seeing a helicopter since they were circling a *round* or *oblong* object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained stationary for approx 3-4 hours then disappeared from view around midnight - 1AM.

It had a orange-white glow to it. It was traveling towards the NW for 10 seconds and it covered about 15 % of the sky before it made a dead stop, did a looped U-turn and then just &#34;popped&#34; out of sight.  It was very high up, wasn&#39;t blnking like a plane, and was not a satellite. It was also not a meteorite  or anything else of that sort.  It was too slow for that, but too fast for a normal plane, and what kind of high altitude plane can stop on a dime and make a u-turn?  To note: this was the night of the blackout in the NE, and half of the electric was out in the area which gave us a decent chance to see clearly what was up in the sky.  There were also many criss-crossed chemtrails in the sky early the next morning.  I thought this was weird since the NE had very few airline flights from the previous 16-20 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I took the Walpole Island ferry to the American side,  Algonac, MI.  I was riding on M-29 on my way to an Iggy Pop concert when the blackout occurred.  All of a sudden, the radio station I was listening to stopped broadcasting,  I thought it was just my car.  But then the streetlights weren&#39;t working.  The radio station all of a sudden came back on and Detroit DJ Arthur Penthowell, 101 FM WRIF announced their was a huge blackout and the Iggy concert was cancelled.  I turned around and drove back home sad as I wouldn&#39;t be seeing Iggy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got home about 6:30 - 7:00 p.m. and walked into my parents house.  My father was looking out the big picture window in the living room at an object in the sky.

It was coming from the direction of the power plant in Sarnia (approx. 35 miles away).  It&#39;s movement was meandering and it changed shapes and slowly meandered in our direction.  It would go one way and go the other, didn&#39;t go up and down, continued at same height.  It came really close to us and still we couldn&#39;t make out a definite shape to it.  It was cute to watch for it&#39;s &#34;unconcerned&#34; way of moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it&#39;s started slowly meandering away from us, changing shapes and moving in it&#39;s funny way.  We watched it do that for about a minute.  Then suddenly, it zoomed incredibly fast until it disappeared into nothing.  It moved so fast, it became a black dot, then nothing.  It didn&#39;t move up, it just continued moving horizontal but in a linear fashion.  No meandering, just zoom until it was out of our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We still talk about it.

I say this with a fair amount of confidence because, two years ago, I was commuting home from work at about 18:00 hrs in the summer on Interstate-75 heading northbound to Pasco County, FL. I was caught in a traffic jam and remained stationary for a good 20-30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of nowhere, I saw a black sliver of something floating over the interchange where 1-75 merges onto I-4 East to Orlando.  I then stared at it for a few seconds more and I struggled to make out what it was.  As it got closer, I then realized that this is a B-2 Stealth Bomber gliding over the interstate to my right hand side at about an altitude of perhaps 100 feet! It was a startling sight. I had my car in neutral and i bolted out of my seat in excitement and stuck my head out of my sunroof. I saw it make a graceful arc and bank in a westerly vector towards Tampa Bay. I believe it was on final approach to land at nearby MacDill AFB. This aircraft glided by and made no noise (over my engine noise), i was able to get a dead-on side view of it and I could even make out the pilots helmet as the sun glared through the cockpit glass. Thats how Low and slow this thing was. If I had not been looking out to my right as I was sitting in traffic with nothing to do, I would have missed it completely. That is how &#34;low-observable&#34; this aircraft is even in a populated area. Since this was an explained observation, I do not need to be contacted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

We were on our way to the pub. We had been walking North on MacKenzie Street and made for the steps between the Connaught Building and the United States Embassy. As I was walking down the steps, I noticed what looked like a hot air balloon in the sky straight ahead of us, i.e. looking East and down George Street. (Note: it is quite common to see hot air balloons over the Ottawa sky. It would be unusual to see them at that time of day however. They usually appear around 6:00 or 6:30 p.m.)  When I glanced back at it a few seconds later – now having crossed Sussex Drive and walking on the North sidewalk of George St., I noticed the object’s strange behaviour: changing shape, which a hot air balloon does not do.  I tried to get (name withheld) to check it out but by the time I got him to look up, it had disappeared from view behind some buildings. I then figured out why its shape was changing: it was a saucer-like object that was slowly turning on its side, tipping one way then returning to an upright position only to tip on its other side. It was possibly 10 to 20 meters in diameter and perhaps 3-5 meters in height. It was red and dull-grey steel. I think the centre dome-part was red and the rest of it was dull-grey. When I first saw the object, it was about 500-600 meters away and at an altitude of about 150-200 meters. It made no noise, had no blinking lights and did not leave any type of trail in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we rounded the corner of Williams Street, we both saw the object in the sky moving due North at a relatively low speed that I would estimate to be between 50-70 km/h. BY then it was about 1 kilometer away. I had a digicam but did not choose to use it because by then the object was pretty far away and it would have probably appeared as a small dot on a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a row of lights in the front that were red and yellowish in color. The lights were twinkling rather fast and behind that was a glob of lights (same color as front row of lights).

Last night coming from a meeting and dinner out, I observed a very large brightly lit object floating, for lack of a better term, just over the tree line headed West (there is a small commercial airport) West of the City.  However, this object, didn&#39;t seem to be moving like an aircraft in a landing pattern.  Object was barely moving!  What attracted my attention was the unusual configuration of the lights which seemed to be in a row all on one side facing me.  This was as big as a dirigible or blimp, but didn&#39;t seem to emit any sound.  It was of indeterminate distance, and size.

I watched it while driving (not too safe, I know!) and putting along in the slow lane. I exited the freeway about two miles down, turned east so I could not see it, then turned north again and caught it for a few moments more. I went into a store for about 5 minutes or so, then saw it again when I returned to my car. It was now moving very slowly south. I returned to the freeway and saw a military plane approach it and seem to circle around it. With this perspective, I could see that it wasn&#39;t very large or very high in the air, maybe just a couple thousand feet up. I passed a tall hill, common in Portland, and could no longer see it.

The witness told me he packed his camera and tripod up and headed over to one of the fields on their farm. He was going to capture some shots of the planet Mars and the Moon as it is so beautiful right now. As he was setting up his equipment he noticed something very odd. In a totally clear sky he watched a cloud starting to form very quickly. As he mentioned it came out of no where and seemed to be shaping up in a oblong shape. Due to the Moon being bright he had no problem in watching this phenomena. The fellow also said there was some type of disturbance which was taking place in the cloud itself. He tried to explain what he saw, and the best example he could come up was: From end to end of this narrow formed cloud, it appeared to look like someone had taken a shot with a powerful gun, and the force of the shell was cutting through the cloud. Causing a disturbance within, or center of the cloud which ran from end to end. There was no lights/object seen at all, just this strange long mass of cloud which appeared right out of nowhere. It sat stationary for approx: 4 to 5 minutes and dissipated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

This part of Oregon is one of the most isolated places in the United States.  There weren&#39;t any lights and the sky was clear, so you could really see the milky way going across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the only one on the highway at that time and my partner was in the truck sleeper.  I looked in my rear view mirror and saw another semi truck coming up fast behind me.  I thought he would pass me but when he got up behind me he slowed down really fast and started yelling to me on his CB radio about lights in the sky.  He wanted to know if I had seen the lights in the sky to the left (east).  I told him that I hadn&#39;t seen the lights but that I would keep my eyes open for them.  I could tell that something was wrong because you could hear he was afraid of something in his voice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We traveled down Hwy 95 for about three minutes when he started yelling again about lights to the left of us in the sky.  I looked out my left window and saw two large round lights sitting side by side in the sky.  I could see the outline of the hills and the lights were about 45 degrees up.  They were a yellowish white and not moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I slowed my truck down and watched the lights for about 10 seconds when, all of a sudden, no other way to explain it, like from the movie Close Encounters, below the two top lights the bottom row came on.  The lights started coming on from the left to the right, then started all over again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As one light came on, about the third light back would go off.  There were always three lights going across from left to right.  These lights were the same color as the two top lights but were shaped like beer cans.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the bottom row of lights came on, I yelled at my partner to get up and see this.  The top and bottom row of lights stayed on together about 10-15 seconds, then all the lights went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a turnout on the highway so we pulled both trucks off the road and the three of us got out and for about 40 minutes, the three of us watched the sky but the lights never came back on.  One thing we noticed was was only one cloud in the sky and it was a clack cloud that was in the area of the lights.  There was a strong wind blowing but the cloud never moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When were were looking at the lights you could tell they were hooked to a structure.  The structure was very large, dead still in the sky.  With your thumb at arm&#39;s length, it would cover about 1/2 of the lights.  I would say it was disk shaped by the way the light looked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard the military took pictures of it and was on the news.  I am a retired deputy sheriff and have studied astronomy all my life.  What I/we saw that night was not one of ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first chance I&#39;ve had to report this to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a very bright object about the size of the brightest star, which at first, was moving at an almost imperceptible speed. It was in the east, southeast part of the sky, at an angle of about 30 degrees. It accelerated north from its position, but always moving slower than a satelite, and faded out at about 5 degrees from its original position. I searched for the object for about 4 seconds when I noticed another object of the same magnitude a few degrees southwest of the first. It moved the same direction and speed as the first, and it also faded in the same manner and area as the first. Again, both objects seemed not to be moving at first, but accelerated about 5 degrees from their original positions and faded. Most satelites I watch travel well past 90 degrees at this time in the evening, and I&#39;ve never seen 2 satelites travel this close to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the planet, Mars, would be in the area of the sky that the witness indicates at the time of the sighting, and it would be very prominent.

It was about the second day of the Anarchist Mountain fire in Penticton. I was watching the clouds west over Okanagon Lake. Under the huge clouds were a string of smaller clouds lined up like beads. The heat haze and smoke from the south were over the lake and the whole picture was slowly moving north. The last cloud stopped, and slowly moved deliberately and casually down behind Terrace mountain, in the opposite direction of the sky flow. There was an orange glow in the center of the cloud.

As well they were rotating quite quickly, but moving very slowly. One of the objects broke off from the group and moved slowly upwards and left this wispy white trail.

It appeared every 32 to 35 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was first noticed fairly high in the sky, and very slowly moved due East.  We are surrounded by trees, so we could not track it very far, but it took at least 30 minutes to move the short distance.  Through binoculars, it still did not have any specific shape and looked white to slightly yellow.  There were no clouds at the time.  As stated above, there was a full moon up, and we are less than 10 miles from Seattle, so there is a lot of light pollution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen plenty of satelites in the past, but this seemed quite different.

At one point she was looking throught the window saying &#34;what&#39;s that above the trees?&#34;  Next moment she run outside and I followed her.Looking in the direction she was looking at I could see above the trees a black disk spinning.  From where I was I could say its size was of a round big plater.It flipped over and I realized it was flat.The other side was bright red with a silver bright ring around it.I was in shock.I never seen anything like this before.<n>

She was standing in her kitchen at the time. She moved quickly onto the deck of the family&#39;s home and was surprised, or should I say shocked to see an unknown object hovering over the trees close by. She said it flipped over and it turned a bright blood red. She screamed to her husband to come quick to watch this strange thing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he arrived on the deck he saw a cigar shaped object.  He thought quickly,  ran back into their home and grabbing his brand new camcorder he scanned the sky for the object and began filming. Eventually when he lost sight of the object he went back inside and played the tape over and over.  To his surprise and everyone else&#39;s .. what he saw completely shocked him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mark quickly contacted Peter Davenport at the NUFORC in Seattle, Washington in the United States to file a report and told Peter what he had caught on tape. Mr. Davenport passed the report onto myself (HBCC UFO Research) and Gavin McLeod. Gavin made arrangements with Mark to visit him  and take his report and to view the video footage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of days after speaking with Gavin, Mark sent out a portion of the footage to myself, Gavin McLeod, Mr. Jeff Rense and a number of others who may have found the Quick Time Player UFO footage of some interest.  Many did find it interesting but one  immediately ruled it as &#34;a helium filled foil balloon&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;This material below is from my observations of this tape.&#34;  Mark and I corresponded and discussed the video footage. In one of our telephone conversations he mentioned that he&#39;d not bothered to slow the tape down. When the running speed of the footage was slowed down greatly, some interesting things started to appear. Mark suggested sending me a copy of the original tape he&#39;d filmed so that I could have a better look at it.   When it was slowed down it was apparent that this was no ordinary &#34;helium filled balloon&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the fellow started filming, the object drops down from the sky, then enters from the top of the screen.  Mark at this point has the camcorder zoomed in and catches the object making sharp turns as it goes down, moving to the right, then back to the left, drops down, moves right and back to the left, always making sharp movements downwards until it disappears very quickly........<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mark was still filming when the object left his view.... however when the film was seen slowed down .... it was still there. It had moved rapidly across the sky. One blink and it would be missed !   Suddenly in the distance one can clearly see it re-appearing and entering the camera&#39;s field of view looking like a white dot in the sky. As it travels a great distance to the east, over a good portion of the sky, with a reflection that could have been caused by the sun ...  it finally disappears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What it does next is very interesting.  From out of the east (its position where it disappeared) .. it reappears, still glistening, and travels west at a steady pace.  At one point it makes a complete stop.!!!  Then it moves south towards Mark&#39;s position.   When using the Quick Time Player to view his footage one can notice that Mark zooms in on the object and catches what looks like an aura surrounding it ... for a short period of time.  He also films what may be the underside of it, until it slowly moves away, turning on its side, taking on a clear saucer shape and  it appears to be discharging a dark unknown substance.  The strange discharge occurs  twice.  One from the left side of the object and the other from the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again Mark tries to find the object in the sky but can&#39;t seem to locate it. He zooms back out and finds nothing.  He continues his search  zooming out and in and for a split second he captures it once again in the very spot he was searching and where previously there was nothing.  The camera again picked the object up and it seemed to come out of nowhere and was gone again as quickly as it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding the Quick Time Player internet clip..... I have heard a number of things about the footage, but not once have I heard anyone mention the discharge which comes off the object just after it flattens out and before it disappears from view  (or when the object is lost due to Mark trying to focus in on it). If you take a good close look at the internet footage, you will notice two of these types of discharges , one to it&#39;s left and the other to its right. )  I found it interesting when viewing the footage that the day before, on August 10, 2003, Mark was filming his family&#39;s visit to the Abbotsford Airshow, which is a major happening every year and draws aircraft from all over the world.  The video footage clearly shows an aerial display of known aircraft  taking place the day before the sighting happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other note I would like to make, which I found to be very important also, was the remark made by Mark&#39;s mother-in-law who was speaking in her native Romanian tongue as she watched the object perform in the sky.  She made a comment and Mark translated for me... &#34;the bottom of it has turned brilliant bright red&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusion:  1. The object makes extreme sharp maneuvers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. The object travels at a great distance and then returns from the direction it came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. At one point in the video, the object comes to a complete stop and hovers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. The bottom of the object changes it&#39;s color to almost a blood red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. The object ejects  a black substance on two occasions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6. In some parts of the film it travels at an extreme rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7. In one portion of the tape the object looks like it has an aura around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8. There were a number of witnesses to this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the object is for sure I am not certain.   It was extremely interesting, extremely puzzling, and who knows what it was.??  I spent hours viewing the video .. over and over again.... at all types of speed to try and determine what it might have been .. all to no avail.   I enjoyed it immensely and found it very exciting.   With Mark&#39;s permission I will be forwarding it on for further examination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mark&#39;s video footage is copyrighted M.M 2003   Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

I was traveling north on I-10 and approaching Prince when I noticed 4 really bright lights hanging in the sky ahead of me. I thought that they might be a plane, but planes never directly fly over or near the freeway. As I approached Orange Grove I could see that they haven&#39;t moved since I first saw them. At this time I called my uncle who was at my grandmas house on the east side of town. He went outside and saw the lights too. At Ina, I went directly beneath them and I could see the sky between them so they werent attached. I got off the freeway at Cortaro and pulled in to a Chevron but the lights were gone. No one was around me on the freeway..the lights were about 100 ft if that far above me at Ina. I didn&#39;t hear any noise and my car didn&#39;t do anything weird. There was no object...just pure light as far as I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My uncle said that 2 of the lights went out and that the other two started to move towards the east side and he went inside to get his glasses and when he came out they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were doing maybe 45mph heading south-west when to the direct-south we saw an extrodinary green light on the horizon. It had to have been several miles out, but the glow lit up the sky above us like a pale day light. It seemed to pulse once, and then slightly less again to the west of the first. It was a quite night and we heard no boom or crack as if it was some sort of explosion. We spent the next hour driving south on 360 and around the mansfield/cedar hill area looking for the cause. None found, and no good excuse either. Theres a power plant out that way, but its natural gas, and it stood peacefully with all of its yellow lights on. This ones unexplained for now, and all four of us have seen it at one time or another.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On Sunday night, August 10th, I went out behind the house and saw what I thought was Mars.  It was a very bright star just to the right of the moon.  Now I am not an astronomer, so I had no real Idea where Mars was supposed to be located that night. But that star was so bright,  It couldn’t be anything else.  I went inside,  and about 10 minutes later I came out to show my girlfriend Mars.  It was still there, shining brightly just to the right of the moon.  I went inside for a moment to get a soda, and when I came back out, my girlfriend pointed to the sky and asked &#34;What is that in the sky!&#34;  I looked up.  There was a bright object moving across the sky.  It wasn’t a shooting star, It was moving slow.  It wasn’t a satellite either, It was much brighter and moving much faster than a satellite would,  most likely in a much lower earth orbit. I have seen many satellites in the night sky and this was not one. And it sure wasn’t an airplane. There were no running lights blinking away.  I watched it disappear over the horizon and then turned back to look at Mars.  It was gone.  Where there once was a bright star,  there was nothing.  My Girlfriend then told me that while I was inside,  she saw the object begin to move from its stationary spot in the sky before she pointed it out to me.  A while later, I saw the true Mars rising.  Just where it was supposed to be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With so many people looking to the stars in search of Mars, there have got to be more people who have seen the same thing that we saw.<n>

I was coming home from a friends house between 8 or 9 o&#39;clock down lafever road and I look up in the sky out of my firebird and noticed a weird light way out in the sky.  It was pretty far away probably around 50 miles or so.  So I kept watching the light and it made some weird movements witch kind freaked me out so I steeped on the gas.  I had that car going over 100 miles an hour and I watched the light as I was driving and it started following me.  About 300 yards before the stop sign I could actually see the shape of the craft. It was a triangle shape with lights going all around the perimeter.  The stop sign is approaching so I had to stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came to a stop I looked out the side of my window to get a look at the aircraft and I didn&#39;t see it but then I noticed it was right above my car just hovering above the tree tops not making a noise.

I LOOKED AT THE SKY AND I SAW THIS W|10/15/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32127.html|416|ndxe200308| Stationary object over New Mexico<n> <n><n> <n><n> While passing the football to my son and a couple of his friends, I looked up in broad daylight, and saw an object in the southwestern sky that was glowing extremely brightly. It was way off. I was on the east side of Albuquerque, and this thing looked to be to the extreme west, southwest end of Albuquerque, or even possibly a little farther out over the mountains. It was maybe 10,000 feet up. I regularly observe Venus, and Mars, and know exactly what both look like, and where to find them in the sky. This object was way brighter than Venus, or any star, and it was still broad daylight. I stopped passing the ball and just stared at it. One of the kids (ab out 10 years old) asked what I was looking at, and I said I didn&#39;t know. The kid laughed and said it was a UFO. I ruled out a Hot Air Baloon, Venus, a helicopter, and it obviously wasn&#39;t a plane because this object hovered there for more than an hour and a half. I should note that it&#39;s position in reference to Earth never changed. During this 100 minutes, any celestial object would have disappeared over the horizon, but this one remained at the same relative position over the horizon the whole time. After we finished playing catch, me and my son drove down to Target, still watching this object hovering in the same spot. By this time I was fairly sure it was a UFO. Now here&#39;s how I know this wasn&#39;t venus, because if you do your homework, you&#39;ll probably conclude that I was looking at Venus, especially as bright as it is right now, but this was August of 2003. Venus wasn&#39;t unusually bright then, like it is now. This is how I judged how far off and how high it was. Because as the Sun went down over the western horizon, and the western sky turned red, this object also went from glowing a bright white, to turning red as the sky turned red. And when the sky went from red to dark, the object went from reddish, to disappearing in the darkness. So my conclusion is that it was in fact not Venus, it was in the atmosphere, it turned red as the sunl! ight weakened, and disappeared in the dark because it&#39;s glow was actually the sunlight reflecting off of it. I should also note that about a month later, someone sent George Noory a photo of a UFO over arizona within a month of my sighting, and it looked like the same thing I had seen. So two similar sightings within a month, one in New Mexico, and one in Arizona. The other thing I found totally suspicious was that this thing had to be on Kirtland Air Force Base&#39;s radar. It was within a few miles of the base, but no aircraft ever approached it the whole time it was there. I should also note that it hovered not to far from where air traffic comes in to the Albuquerque Sunport. However, I never saw any commercial flights coming in in that vicinity all during the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

I took a second look to make sure that what I was looking at wasn&#39;t a reflection.  I was startled and excited at what I saw.  The object was moving from West to East across the Yakima valley.  The object traveled very quickly and changed its trajectory three separate times.  The shape of the object was a triangle.  It appeared to be solid in shape, it was about the size of a star at night and was white in color, and did not have a vapor trail. I watched it for as long as it stayed visible, which was about ten to fifeteen seconds.  The object went behind cloud cover and that was the last I saw of this object.  This was my first sighting of a UFO and I feel very fortunate to have seen one.  My wife was outside with me during my sighting, but unfortunately was unable to see the object. I think she was looking just a little below the object. I am a male in my 30&#39;s and this is my first UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a cloudy morning with low cloud cover, as I was going up a hill part of the cloud disappeared. All I saw was the front of an extremely large craft. It was triangular in the front and was getting wider toward the back. I saw what appeared to be plates on the side coming to an edge like the top of a pup tent. It was the color of bronze and it flew very slow because it was moving with the clouds. I&#39;m not aware of any government craft that is this large my estimation since the back wasn&#39;t visible would be two large aircraft carrierss. Now I have to appologize to everyone who has seen a UFO and reported it because I didn&#39;t believe in them until it happened to me.

I&#39;m usually sceptical about things like this. I noticed a flash of light and thought it was travelling fast for a plane that was making no sound, so I walked to the end of the yard and saw a boomerang type shape, glowing orange, gliding silently through the sky. It was moving fast and as I watched it, it seemed to suddenly disappear after so many seconds, although I could see it for several seconds before it disappeared. It was not (in my experience) anything like a plane. And the weird thing was that it was travelling in a way that did not seem aerodynamic. Rather than travelling in the &gt; shape, it was travelling in a &lt; position. Shortly afterwards, there was a lot of activity outside. Dogs barking and I swear there were more sirens than usual in a long burst. It&#39;s 12:24am and maybe in the morning, this will all be explained, but it was a weird experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The reunion is held in a town of 200 in a heavily forrested area of northern Wisconsin.  My sister left to go home just before I did.  She flagged us down on the county road, an we pulled over.  She pointed to an opening in the forrest and said what is that. We looked at an area that is cleared for a natural gas pipe line from Canada.  The width of the clearing is about 100 feet wide and runs from Canada through the center of the United States. At the top of the hill about 1 mile from the road we saw four bright white lights, equally spaced. The two lights in the middle were brighter than the lights on the side, as if they were pointed in a slightly different direction. The distance the two end lights were appart was about 50 feet (it took up about 1/2 of the clearing).  We went back to the farm house that we had the fire at to get a pair of binoculars.  We came back with two more people and looked through the binoculars at the lights.  Through the binoculars we could make out somewhat of a shape, as if the lights were attached to a piece of equipment.  The lights seamed to pulsate when looked at with the naked eye, but did not when seen thruogh the binoculars.  We all tried to guess what this could be.  A piece of farm equipment, but it was on government land, late at night, not moving, no sound.  There was no electricity to power the lights, a generator or equipment would make a noise.  It was so quiet, you could here for miles.  No one wanted to walk through the tall grass to get a closer look, (in retrospect I wish I did).  We were not sure how far away it was.  My wife and I went back to our cabin.  When we told the story to our daughter and her boy friend they wanted to see.  When we went back, it was still there.  The next day we hiked about one mile to the top of the hill, though thick waist high grass, were we saw the object.  We saw no signs of anything.  The grass was not flattend, no tire tracks,! foot prints, ect.  What we saw was at the top of a hill, so it couldn&#39;t have been any further, or we wouldn&#39;t be able to see over the hill, unless it was higher than the hill.  We walked another 3 miles and saw no signs of anything.  Eight people in all saw this, and at this time nobody can explain what we saw.  We plan asking the locals if anyone was in the area at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a note attached to a computer printout of air activity over the Portland, Troutdale, Hillsburo area. At the top was the Port of Portland insignia and the following typed information to the right of the Printout...<n> <n><n> <n><n> August 29, 2003  Between 22:30-22:40 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All aircraft operations over the Gresham area between 10:30 and 10:40 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *The circles are five miles apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ..and a note that said, &#34;Eric. Possibly the person saw the Boing 767-300 (B763) coming in from the West.  It was headed strait for him for several minutes. I&#39;m also thinking that with all the pilots in the area at that time, anything unusual would have been reported.&#34;  After examining the map Byler concurred with this opinion as the print out clearly showed the flight path and location of the plane in question during its journey towards landing at PDX. The Intersection of NW Angeline AV. and NW 5th St. in Gresham are also clearly marked on the map as mentioned in the original witness report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are four commercial flights represented on the map, three arrivals and two departures. At exactly 10:28 PM Boing 767-300 (B763) was arriving and was due west of the witness, 14 miles out and at 6998 feet. The flight traveled for about fifteen miles at 221 miles per hour on a nearly strait on flight path toward the witnesses location at Angeline and 5th, bright landing lights on, and then circled that location at about one mile out.  It then began its strait decent to the North West toward landing at PDX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also in the air at 10:28 PM...<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1) An arrival due South of the witness, 10 miles out and at 4961 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2) An arrival due North of the witness, 5 miles out and at 1486 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3) A departure northeast of the witness, 17 miles out and climbing at 5666 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4) An arrival that had just landed from the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been confirmed that none of the other pilots in the area reported an unidentified during the duration of the witnesses sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been confirmed that the tower did not see an unidentified craft in the airspace of the witnesses sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No one coming or going from the Portland International Airport reported seeing an unidentified craft in the area of the Airport as described it should have been at the end of the witness report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness himself does not report seeing the 767 in his airspace when the printout clearly shows he should have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The logical explanation is that he did in fact see the 767 in his airspace.  The fact that it was dark at 10:30 PM and that he was only seeing a series of lights lead us to the conclusion that he simply connected the dots with strait lines to give the illusion he was seeing a triangle shaped craft.  This is very common with night light sightings. The fact that the entire sighting took place from a moving car also seems to account for his not hearing the commercial flight and would also seem to account for the other moments in the report when the lights appeared to &#34;pivot&#34; smoothly and turn in an odd manor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oregon UFO Research Director Skip Schultz writes...&#34;In regards to the Gresham sighting, I have reviewed the data Eric received from The Port of PDX and the witness report. I agree with Erics analysis of the sighting. There were a number of identified airplanes in the approach pattern at the time of the sighting. One aircraft was in the reported location and at the exact time the witness reported seeing the triangular lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, if there was an unknown object in the same flight pattern as the airplanes we have verified were there at the time, they would have reported this to the PDX tower. Also, if the witness was able to see the lights, the tower would have also seen these lights. The tower would have immediately called the unknown asking for identification since there would have been no transponder signal. With no response from the unknown, it would have been turned over to our contact at the abatement department for verification. At this point the Air National Guard would have been alerted to scramble and identify the unknown. This did not happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight data Eric presents clearly shows that at the time of the sighting there was an aircraft in that pattern, in the exact location and landing at PDX. The lights disappearing at the point reported by the witness disappeared at the exact time that the known airplane landed at PDX. Media did not report that a UFO landed at PDX so we can conclude with certain confidence this sighting was the known airplane verified in the area at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was some disagreement with Oregon MUFON as to whether the pilots would report this to the tower if they had seen an unidentified in the first place.  OUFOR is convinced that there is no conspiracy at the airport right now due to the heightened awareness and concern of terrorist threats and that if an unknown were to have been spotted our contact would have shared that information with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We conclude that the witness misidentified the lights of a 767 on its final 7 minute approach to PDX as a triangle craft based solely on light patterns, a very common occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Special thanks to Peter Davenport for sharing witness information with us and for MUFON State Director Tom Bowden for his follow up investigation in the Gresham area that included several witness interviews.   We also would like to thank Jerry Gerspatch of the Port of PDX (Portland International Airport) for his continued cooperation and information sharing in this and past UFO investigations we have conducted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eric Byler - Assistant Director, Oregon UFO Research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.oregonuforeview.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Eric Byler, of Oregon UFO Review, for investigating, and sharing, this report.

It was also much to slow to be a shooting star. It changed directions and seemed to be getting brighter when it went behind a cloud. We watched intently as it moved past the cloud and then disappeared. We stayed awhile to see if it would return but after about five minutes we left for home.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were facing north; skies were clear and sunny. There was no sound, no vapor trails, or visible exhaust of any kind.  Husband got a brief look through binoculars before the craft went behind a sign obstructing our view.  Though viewed only briefly through 8X binoculars the craft appeared to have light colored (perhaps silver) drop shaped wings.  Where the wings joined was a central area that was much darker than the wings with what was perhaps a cockpit in the center.  We know this sounds like a bird or a plane but the pattern of movement was far too agile for a plane and the objects appeared too large for the apparent distance to be birds.  Once they went behind the sign obstructing our view (which was very close relative to the distance of the objects) we waited for them to reappear but they didn&#39;t!  The objects were too high (our viewing angle was at least 30 degrees) to have dropped below the horizon and there were no other obstructions or clouds to block our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The husband is a ((deleted--businessman)) and the wife is an ((deleted--public employee with considerable responsibility).

I WAS FACING E/SE WHEN I FIRST NOTICED A FLASH TO THE NE OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE. SEEING AS WE ARE CLOSE TO SKY HARBOR AIRPORT IN PHOENIX, I EXPECTED A PLANE AND REALLY THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT. 30 SECONDS LATER ANOTHER FLASH IN THE CORNER OF MY EYE. I TURNED TO FACE THE DIRECTION OF THE FLASH, E/NE AND WAITED. SURE ENOUGH, ABOUT 30 SECONDS LATER, ANOTHER FLASH. I POINTED THE AREA OUT TO MY AMIGOS AND WE WAITED. 30 SECONDS, ANOTHER FLASH. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TUMBLING SPACE DEBRIS WHICH CAN COMMONLY PRODUCE FLASHES AS IT TUMBLES IN ORBIT AND REFLECTS SUNLIGHT. THE ODD THING ABOUT THIS WAS IT WASN&#39;T MOVING. I&#39;VE SEEN MANY, MANY SATELLITES IN MY DAY, SOME FLASHING AND SOME LIKE A MOVING STAR BUT THEY ALL HAD A DISCERNIBLE MOVEMENT. THIS OBJECT STAYED IN THE SAME EXACT SPOT AS WHEN I FIRST SAW IT FOR A GOOD 13/14  MINUTES. NO HIGHER OR LOWER IN THE SKY AND FLASHING WITH A BRIGHTNESS LIKE THAT OF MARS, VERY BRIGHT, MUCH BRIGHTER THAN ANY STARS IN THE SKY. I RAN INSIDE TO GET BINOCULARS, ASKING MY FRIENDS TO PLEASE KEEP WATCH OF THE AREA. AS I RETURNED THEY HAD BEEN TIMING THE FLASHES AND THEY WERE BETWEEN 27-30 SECONDS WITH NO CHANGE IN LUSTER. INTERESTINGLY WHEN I PUT THE BINOCULARS ON IT, I COULD QUITE EASILY SEE THE FLASH BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE AFTER THE FLASH, NO MOVING OBJECT, NO DISTANT SMALL PLANE, NOTHING. BY THIS TIME I&#39;DE SAY 12-14 MINUTES HAD PASSED WITH THIS FLASHING LIGHT REMAINING FIXED IN THE SKY WITH THE SAME APPARENT BRIGHTNESS. THE 3 WITNESSES HAVE ALL SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME OUTDOORS, MY BROTHER IS A GUIDE ON THE COLORADO RIVER IN THE GRAND CANYON, SO WE HAVE SEEN MANY OF THE MISIDENTIFIED UFO&#39;S COMMONLY REPORTED, SATELLITES, METEORS, ODD ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA, THIS THING MATCHED NOTHING I HAVE SEEN BEFORE. I WOULD SAY THE LAST 60-90 SECONDS WERE VERY STRANGE. THE OBJECT STILL WAS FLASHING ON 30 SECOND CYCLES BUT IN THE LAST MINUTE AS IT FLASHED IT WAS GETTING LOWER AND LOWER! IN THE SKY, STILL VERY BRIGHT BUT OBVIOUSLY COMING DOWN(or moving away). THE LAST 2 FLASHES GOT VERY DIM, THE LAST BEING BARELY VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE, AS MY BROTHER STATED TO ME. THROUGH MY BINOCULARS IT SEEMED TO GET RED, THEN REDDISH BLUE AND STOPPED FLASHING. WE STAYED OUTSIDE FOR 20 MORE MINUTES AND IT DIDN&#39;T APPEAR AGAIN. I SUPPOSE IT COULD BE A SATELLITE MOVING FROM SW TO NE AND SEEING AS IT WAS FLYING AT A CERTAIN ANGLE TO US ON THE GROUND, IT COULD ACCOUNT FOR A BIT OF MOVEMENT DISTORTION(like a plane coming straight towards you from a distance). HOWEVER I DOUBT 10+ MINUTES COULD PASS WITH NO APPARENT MOVEMENT, EVEN A SATELLITE SHOULD BE SEEN TO MOVE A BIT THROUGH THE SKY IN THIS AMOUNT OF TIME. IT WAS DEFINITELY ODD AND I&#39;D LOVE TO HEAR FROM ANYONE WHO HAS SEEN A SIMILAR OBJECT OR WHO MAY HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR IT&#39;S LACK OF MOVEMENT. TO US, IT REMAINS UNKNOWN....…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of several similar reports NUFORC has received during July and August 2003 of tiny, long-duration, blinking lights, allegedly witnessed in the night sky by seemingly credible witnesses.

I was lying on my hammock when I saw the object fly straight over my head, fast, no sound from about NE to SW.  The weirdest thing about it was that it opened a pocket in the clear blue sky and disappeared through it.  When the pocket closed a whisp of white cloud came out and drifted over the sky.  The object was shiny and looked like it was reflecting the ground which would make it fairly close.  I&#39;m not a pilot or a meteorologist or an astronomer, so I can&#39;t estimate heights and speeds very well, except that the object was going much faster than the planes that approach the local airport and it had to be pretty low to be reflecting ground.  Also, even though it was usually a busy time at the airport, there were no other aircraft in the vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Man was it cool.  No government on this Earth has anything in their defense inventory that could move like that at that speed, and nowhere near as fast.  On some following nights, I took more footage of more of them.  I got about 4-5 minutes maybe.  It was just a white light with maybe a slight yellowish tint to it.

All I know is this thing had ME thinking it was the moon, which I may add being a novice astronomy buff, isn&#39;t easy to do and it was that bright and THAT far away, before it crept up on us in a matter of seconds, seemed to hover to my right and then zipped off, I totally freaked out that everyone on the freeway didn&#39;t collide, it was that impressive, anyone else see strange things by Aztalan, this is my fourth. I swear this indian burial site has something strange going on with it, saw red lights zippin thru woods one year, another time 3 green glowing things dancing in the sky above the Moon Mound.  I think something is going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway my friend didn&#39;t see a thing, go figure, yet he failed to explain to me where the moon had gone even though he had verified it being infront of us on a clear night, now I don&#39;t know about other places but milw to madison is pretty much a straight shot, if the moons gonna be out, your not going to miss it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was keeping an eye out for raccoons, roughly 5 houses down the opposite side of the street, I saw the first two blue lights flicker from the porch of a house and move quickly towards the street, (I didn&#39;t think much of it at first I thought it was someone running around with a flashlight, until I saw another and finally a white one, kind of like a flare). All three lights moved in a zig zag pattern, moving very fast up. All three lights were no bigger then a basketball. One went up towards the tree line in the same similar zig zag motion and all three were gone at the same time. I did hear about 2 minutes later what sounded like an aircraft flying over head, I&#39;m not sure if it was connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No object or sound was heard, nothing at all actually other than the bright flashes of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did some quick checking and found out that one punch of lightening was seen at the time these folks witnesses the flashes of light. So this one was solved and glad to be able to figure it out quickly. Seems like to many sightings are going unsolved out this way. So again, lightening was the cause of the white and blue flashes of light.

(Lightening)|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30596.html|448|ndxe200308| The light split into 4 lights which formed a square .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Brian Vike,  I too saw something strange in the sky, however this was the night of August 7th, 2003.  Here&#39;s my story:  My husband and I have a summer home at Sakinaw Lake which is on the Sunshine Coast in BC.  One of my favorite things to do at night is to star gaze from the middle of the lake.  The sky is so clear there compared to the city.  Anyways, on August 7th, I took my star gazing gear (blanket, pillow and flashlight) with me on my peddle boat and like usual snuggled down once I got to the middle of the lake.  I usually stay out for a couple of hours and watch the shooting stars before peddling back to our home.  On this night approximately 10:15 p.m. or so, I spotted what I thought was another shooting star.  It streaked across the sky heading southward then stopped.  I thought the shooting star might burn out, but it didn&#39;t.  Instead, the light split into 4 lights which formed a square (1 light in each corner).  One of the lights was brighter than the other 3; made me think it might be bigger than the others.  It stayed in the square formation for 2 to 5 seconds before  it changed forms again.  2 lights stayed in place while the other 2 lights moved slightly away, then stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 4 lights together looked like a rectangle and stayed this way for 1 to 2 seconds.  Then all of a sudden the 2 lights that moved to form the rectangle shot off northward, like parallel shooting stars, while the other 2 lights only separated slightly and remained stationary.  One of the 2 lights that remained was the bright one.  I was shocked and couldn&#39;t believe what I saw. I stayed there until 1:30 a.m. to see if the other 2 would come back.  Then I tried to memorize the location of the 2 remaining lights before heading in, but they looked like stars amongst so many other stars.  It was useless, so I peddled back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my husband and he suggested I look up UFO sightings on the internet.  There are so many skeptics and believe me I would have been one too, that I said I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll bother.  My husband printed a copy of your article for me to read and that&#39;s how I read about the other sighting on July 28th, 2003 and also why I&#39;m emailing you.If you know or hear of any one else that saw what I did that night, please let me know.  I would appreciate any information you can provide.  Thank you!  Yours truly, (name &amp; personal information deleted by HBCC UFO).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to thank the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

I have a 180 degree view of several miles from east to south to west.  I observed a source of light due west southwest, in the direction of point magu\Vandenberg Air Force base.  The craft was putting off a tremendous amount of strobing light, changing from red to green to blue and white.  It was magnitude -3 and about 15 degrees off the western horizon.  Viewed through medium power binoculars, I got the sense of a disc or diamond shape.  After cruising slowly to the north for approximately 15 minutes, the object abruptly disappeared.  After the craft disappeared, several helicopters, both police and civilian (or television) flew through the area.  As I often monitor aircraft approaching the area airports (LAX, Burbank and Van Nuys) from my balcony, I am familiar with just about every kind of aircraft, but this was something else -- something I&#39;ve never seen in Los Angeles before.    I&#39;ve seen craft while skywatching outside the city, but nothing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had to go to the bathroom and since there were no stores in that area we pulled over at a gravel pit. My husband, myself and my friend all went to the bathroom. We admired the stars since they were all so bright. I notice one that seemed to float downward but barely look like it was moving. My friend and I both saw it and thought it looked strange. Definitely not a plane or satellite since it was not moving much- but it did seem to move a little. We were a little freaked out. My husband did not see what we were looking at. We got back in the car and within 5 minutes my husband and I saw a green ball of light just above the phone lines in front of us. It looked like maybe the size of a basketball and was not really bright nor was it dim. It went down and then stopped and went up in a V shaped path. at the top of the V it vanished. We both agreed upon what we saw. We are both science teachers and could not come up with an explanation. It couldn&#39;t have been a meteor since it reversed direction and went up! My friend did not see it from the back seat since it was in front and above the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A star-like light passes in an arc at zenith.  This lasts about two seconds.  The light reappears, following the same arc, for another second then goes out.  Seconds later I see it again, farther away but following approximately the same arc.  This finally disappeared and I did not see it again.  The first time it appeared, I thought it was just like a lightning bug passing overhead.  This would have been very unusual, however, because there were almost no other bugs whatsoever and I had certainly not seen any lightning bugs.  When it reappeared I was sure it was no bug because it was obviously distant, star-like and moving at a rate like a very distant object might move.  A satellite does not orbit in an arc,  an airplane would not have appeared in intervals and would not have taken nearly the same amount of time to travel the way this did - unless it was very, very far away and at such a high altitude.  I have seen so many airplanes, satellites and lightning bugs to know this was not any of this.  The intervals of appearance, the appearance of great altitude and distance and the time it took to travel the distances I observed it all indicate something I cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a very large strangely beautiful cloud that was different from the others because it was lit up with what I perceived as a lot of electrical charge.  It was full of pinkish/purplish bursts of light at it&#39;s very center.  The outside edges of the cloud were so well defined against the dusky background of sky.  I was staring at this light show when I suddenly noticed a bolt of lightning come down out of the bottom of the cloud and strike dramatically towards the earth.  The cloud was almost perfectly parallel to my line of vision.  That is to say, it was directly outside my window at the same elevation as my seat on the plane.  I would estimate the cloud was approximately 500-800 feet away from the plane &amp; I could see above and below the silhouette of the cloud.  It was just after the lightning bolt struck that I noticed that inside the cloud, but at it&#39;s very edge nearest to me, I saw two perfectly round greenish/yellow lights hovering at the very outside edge of the cloud, with just a bit of mist or fog diffusing the lights slightly.(still bright, easily defined round shape)  The 2 round lights were approx. 1-2 ft in diameter and maybe 6-8 ft apart.  They reminded me of 2 green &#34;GO&#34; lights like you would find on a stoplight, only they were side by side &amp; perfectly motionless. I didn&#39;t think they looked like lights from a plane(too lrg) but if they were, I reasoned that they should be moving through the cloud.  I also could&#39;t imagine any aerial machine entering such a spectacularly electric-charged cloud.  It was alone, by itself, so I thought a plane would not be forced to fly THROUGH it.  I never thought it was a plane anyway.  I was in the 32nd row with my young child on my lap so I could see our right wing lit up outside our window in front of me.  It was nothing like those lights.  Our light was small, white! and sort of standing vertically &amp; blinking. My initial reaction was that it was some sort of hovercraft.(although I have never seen a hovercraft)  For an analogy, it reminded me of two greenish yellow eyes staring out from the very edge of the cloud.  They never moved their position within the cloud.  If the cloud moved, which it appeared it did not, then they moved with the cloud in the same position. I never witnessed a craft.  I never really thought to look for one at the time.  If there was one it would have had to be the &#34;front&#34; lights I observed with the bulk of the object hidden in the clouds behind them. Just a footnote, which will make this story sound even wackier...it probably has nothing to do w/this &#34;event&#34;, but while in a town north of me in IN I was with my mother previewing homes for my brother, whom is moving back to this area shortly. I own a real estate company. While traveling down a road towards our next home, a tornadic-like wind burst came out of nowhere and snapped a tree in half, which fell into the path of my van.  I was going approx 45-50 MPH and had I not swerved to get my vehicle off the road as I almost lost control in the grass alongside the road, we would have been crushed.  I have pictures I took at the scene which shows my van surrounded by the upper tree limbs, and across the front &amp; back of my van.  We were not injured.  The van had some damage.  I am glad I had my digital camera w/me...as I was taking interior photos of homes for my brother to see.  There is a Sheriff&#39;s report on this incident.  This story is not so strange, in and of itself, but when my mom called me later that night she said when she got home, which is 25 miles south of the accident site, and she was sitting on her back patio, she noticed that a tree she had  recently purchased by mail order(one of several)and had planted, that was no larger in diameter than your index finger had snapped in two at the center and was fallen over itself. The area had rain that day but no strong winds of any kind acco! rding to the officers at the scene of the accident, or as witnessed by my mother and myself, who had been out all morning/early afternoon.  Later, we also have discovered that both trees were poplars.(hers and the one that fell on us)  That happened 11 days before I saw the lights from my airplane.  If you cannot already tell, I am unnerved by the whole thing.  I am wondering where that burst of wind came from that snapped a 3 ft diameter tree in two as well as a pencil sized tree in half.(in two entirely different locations) Her rear yard is fenced and the gate is locked.  Her dog was inside until she went out back with him.  We witnessed nothing else that day except that &#34;microburst&#34; of wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I notice what I perceived to be a satellite at my zenith (incidentally you don’t see many satellites at our high latitude) when all of a sudden the object stated to zigzag. It appeared to be about the same size as Venus view by the naked eye but it was pale orange in color and seem kind of fuzzy or diffused in comparison to the stars. Its velocity was analogous to a satellite however it was diffidently not in orbit as its trajectory was level as when it vanished it was not at the horizon. The zigzags (it made about 7 – 8) where of a very acute angle and no noticeable radius and the object velocity was unvarying throughout the 8 seconds that I viewed it.

High cirus clouds came across the eastern sky, which part of, and I know this sounds totally crazy and may be just my imagination, formed a face, which was a cross betwwen the feline face found on Mars and the face as seen on the shroud of Turin. The clouds slowly disapated and I closed my eyes for a minute and relaxed. Then I opened my eyes and looked to the north and saw a red glowing object halfway between the horizon and top of the night sky. I had my glasses on. There was no twinkle, just a changing light pattern which was due to the rotation of the object. I stared at it for a minute and then ran into the house to check the time. I came back into the yard and it was still there. It didn&#39;t move, then it moved a little bit to the left, then went dim. The whole shiting must have lasted 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I got closer I noticed that the balloon was glowing and orange in color.  It seemed to be getting closer but moving away at the same time.  It began to take the shape of an orange slice (like the fruit).  As I sped up to get a closer look, the object started to move away faster than any other flying craft that I&#39;ve every seen.  It became so small in such a quick amount of time, it practically disappeared as it moved away further south.  I caught back up to it around 1st ave. and the object was back to its original size.  Everyone around me was looking through their front windshield trying to figure out what the heck this thing was.  It was moving too quickly for me to get truely anywhere near it and I had to exit off the highway.  That&#39;s when I lost sight of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From what I could tell, it appeared to be a single bright light and when it seemed to dim, or turn it left a trail, and you could make out a few more dimmer lights on the side. My friends from Vesta and Van Buren reported the same thing. It changed degrees and altitudes several times until it seemed to rest in the southern sky.

I shut off the fan in my bedroom window. I looked out the window to observe a dredging crew positioned in the first lock  -of the sault locks-. In the sky to my north closer to the Canadian side of the river approx 1/2 miles away i saw a bright light. a secon or two later i noticed another light coming across the eastern part of my viewing area . the second light crossed the horizon e to west to the same general area just north of my position. these lights went back and forth up and down in the night sky back and forth across my vewing area. from th american side to the canadian side. I called my wife to come and watch the lights. A my wife came to the front door to watch the strange lights with me a third light appeared from the west over the international bridge.I thought what in the heck are they ,they definately were not airplanes as they moved too eratic. I figured maybe they were Cost guard helicopters as from time to time they do go up the river to the coast guard base. But these lights would get brighter and dim out flash very brightly and fly eratic patterns east to west north to south around each other.. My wife an i thought that maybe theywere choppers and it was a serch and rescue mission in the saint mary&#39;s river.We observed them for about 25 mins. and they one by one would go west from our view over the international bridge a quarter mile west of us . the last one went back and forth across our viewing area east to west and back a couple of times before it left our site. I had to rush like a madman to get ready for work at this time as it was 10:30 at approx 10: 50 pm I got in my car backed out of my garage put my car in drive got about 50 feet down my alley, i felt and heard a loud rumbling, stopped my car stuck my head out of the window of my car to see the bottom of a large jet fighter going over my car -maybe 2 to3 hundred feet in the air above me  it scrambled west over the bridge in the direction tha! t the lights went.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> FLASHING RED, GREEN and WHITE LIGHTS THAT ALTERNATE<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, let me begin by saying that i do realize that mars is going to be at it&#39;s closest to earth on august 27th, 2003 as it has in roughly 60,000 years. With that in mind, i have seen something in the sky that i&#39;m not sure if it was mars or something else. On August 6th at 10:00 p.m. i&#39;m driving with my two sons and look toward the moon (which was in the southern sky) and directly to the bottom left (at about the 8 o&#39;clock position) we saw a light that was flashing red. Now upon focusing with the naked eye, we could see that it was not only flashing red but also had green and white flashes which would alternate between the three. Very visible! We were very impressed with what we were seeing. We returned home after discussing it on the road and nothing more was said. Now on the next night (August 7th) i went outside in my backyard and looked at the moon again (which was super bright)  in the southern sky, and noticed once again that the red, green and white light was there, only this time at the bottom right at around the 4 o&#39;clock position. This time i went inside and grabbed my binocculars that have 20x50mm field of view 171 ft./1000 yrds. I could see it really well other then the natural unsteadiness of holding them. I&#39;m not sure, but it looked to me as if it was moving ever so slowly. I&#39;m not laying money on that tho. Well, i observed this light for about an 1hr and a half untill i could&#39;nt see it anymore for it had been moving to the west and had tree blockage. I don&#39;t know if mars or any other thing would produce lights of red, green and white which alternate. Very very distinctive. These lights were just a little bigger than a star in size, but i&#39;m not dismissing the fact that it could have been some sort of star or anything other then a UFO. I just want to know what it was.<n>

I can only describe it as a string of pearls, they appeared as white dots against the bright blue sky, hanging and changing formation, sometimes v shaped then slowly changing to a straight line in relation to the ground. that is to say they bisected the earth. Several airlines passed by as this is the regular incoming flight path to San Diego airport. The planes altitude is approx, five to eight thousand feet, this (these) objects were considerably higher. As we were working we could not focus on the ufo for long, I can estimate they were visible for at least half an hour. The planes flying in must have seen them. After they were no longer visible I observed a  plane (military?) flying about the same altitude, the plane appeared quite small due to it&#39;s hieght. So I&#39;m guessing this object(s) must have been quite large. One worker thought they were ballons, as many car dealerships use strings of colored ballons to attract attention, this object resembled that but they were all white, and no balloon would have survived such altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Just a few moments ago I was looking out my window and noticed in front of a cloud something that appeared to be cylinder-shaped making tight circles.  At first I thought perhaps it was an eagle, as it did have dark edges and a lighter center, but as it circled I saw it catch the glint of the sun and shine brightly for a second.  At this point I noticed there were two of them circling round and round, in relatively stationary, tight circles.  They were likely several miles to the west of me, and I&#39;d guess about 5000 feet up -- perhaps 1/3 of the way from horizon to zenith.  I called to my co-worker and he came over and also saw these objects.  Most of the time only one could be seen, but a couple of times the objects were seen to move in an almost synchronised fashion.  They may have been cylinder-shaped, as they tilted while circling, but from my perspective it&#39;s hard to say -- i.e. they may have been disks.  I can say with confidence, they were not airplanes.  In any case, they were fascinating to watch for approximately 5 minutes, when I lost them in a cloudbank.  A few minutes later, at exactly 1.28, I looked out and noticed a dark airplane, flying relatively low -- an old, military-looking prop plane, from west to east.  It passed my building just to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, this morning I saw a small, silent, dark oval drifting very slowly overhead from west to east out my office window, which occasionally seemed to flash a light, and I went outside to watch it; it seemed to hover and float ever so slowly (at times seeming to almost stand still) -- directly overhead.  I won&#39;t make it a separate report, but I consider it suspicious; I wished I had my binoculars with me so that I could have confirmed whether it was a balloon!  My guess is that it was not a balloon, because it was drifting very, very slowly to the east, and the clouds above were moving to the east southeast.  Hard to say.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We know this witness, from previous reports,  and we consider her to be a very good, reliable observer.

Wednesday morning, August 6, 2003.  Time was 08:27:30.  The sky consisted of unbroken gray cloud cover approximately 200 feet thick with its base at approximately 400 feet altitude.  Directly above the highway in my line of site at approximately 10 degrees elevation, a small but very bright orange light came shooting out of the cloud base approximately 1600 feet away from me.  The object&#39;s trajectory out of the cloud base was horizontal at first but immediately curved sharply downward--directly toward the ground below.  The object continued to burn steady until it passed 100 feet altitude at which time it faded out within a full second and visually ceased to exist.  Estimated speed was approximately 50 feet per second.  I was facing SW.  The object travelled at first from my right going to my left (NW to SE) before diving.  Object appeared star-like similar to Planet Venus in image size and intensity with no noticable form.  If the sighting had occurred at night, the brightness could rival a welder&#39;s torch.  Size of object was likely only a couple feet diameter.  Size and distance range was determined by using estimated altitude of cloud ceiling and elevation of object at point of exit from the cloud base.  Object was very close to intersection of Hwy. #301 and Rt. #228 in downtown Waldorf.  There were at least 200 cars between me and that intersection.  There were at least as many cars behind me, as well.  Sighting was brief and unexpected.  No one was seen stopping and getting out of their cars.  Object looked generally like a flare from a flare gun but appeared to have controlled flight, in my opinion.  I am an independant UFO investigator with many sightings to my credit and have personally determined this to be a true unknown.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They looked like headlights on a car but much brighter.  At first I thought it was a helicopter.  As we got closer I could see some red lights on it and the spotlights were no longer as bright and they were shining straight down and more white lights were shining to the west.  It almost looked like a radio tower at first with the red lights.  As we got closer to it I observed there was no tower under these lights and asked my daughter if she could see one.  She could not either.  It wasn&#39;t moving, it just hovered in one spot above the trees.   The bottom of it looked round but the front of it looked a little different and that&#39;s where the red lights were.  I woke up my son to observe this as well.  This object was very large and kind of reminded me of the Star Trek Enterprise without the tail ( that&#39;s the best way I can describe it)  We observed this for several minutes until we could no longer see it anymore.  It did not move at anytime that we observed it.  I am a 40 year old mom and I observed this with my 10 year old daughter and my 14 year old son while driving home from N.C.  I wish we had pulled over to sit and watch it but we were in such shock over seeing this incredible sight we didn&#39;t think of it and it&#39;s not that easy to turn around on the turnpike.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What I am seeing is what I thought was the space station but after reading more about the station I can only conclude it is not. The space station would move quickly across the sky but what I am viewing is stationary. It fades to black and increases in bright red and white lights to an almost blinding radience. i have watched it for almost an hour for the past 3 nights at the same time. It appears in the SE direction. It seems to me as a cross like shape with red lights on two sides and white pulsing lights on the other two sides. It doesn&#39;t move just sits there, fading in and out. The fading makes it appear to be rotating. I really am confused as to what I am seeing and would really like someone to tell me it is an explainable thing. My husband has seen it with me last night but didn&#39;t observe it as long as I did. It  stays there for the same time each night but I always come in after an hour and just is still there when I go back out side. There have been clear night skies with no clouds as all the other stars are visible all around. Our town is pretty small and we do not have alot of illuminating lights so it is very clear. I am stumped with this.<n>

Without Joe being kind enough to send the report, we may have lost this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Note: I telephoned the witness today (August 8, 2003) at his home in North Bay Ontario. The fellow was kind enough to share what he and two other friends had witness on August 8, 2003 at 12:32 a.m. Also I will be hearing from the other two witnesses who were there. I will update the sighting with their information after I receive it. Also pictures are going to be emailed to me so one might determine what this thing was. The witness I talked with said he has the pictures already developed and had them handy when chatting with me. He also mentioned that the pictures did not come out all that well, but you can still see something sitting in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness told me that he and a couple of close friends had just dropped off one of their buddies. As they continued down the road they came to a full stop at the street light. The witness I talked with said while at a complete stop he turned his head to the right and saw a really strange object, he then pointed in the direction the object was sitting to alert his friends what he was looking at. All the fellows at this point were stunned at what they were seeing, so they pulled the vehicle over at an arcade business to watch. Due to this object being so low they wondered if it was attached by a cable, wire, etc.. because it sat stationary in one position. At this point they grabbed the camera, got out of the vehicle and took three snap shots of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He told me while they stood watching the object it started to pulsate then disappeared, or blinked out. The object was sitting at approx: 250 feet (or close guess) off the ground, it was also very close to the witnesses as they estimated it to be about 6 to 7 blocks away from their position. It was cigar shaped, and solid grey in color. The total viewing time was approx: 3 to 5 minutes after they first spotted it. Also I was told that stood out from everything around them, meaning it wasn&#39;t extremely bright, but you couldn&#39;t miss it sitting in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked if any sound could be heard coming from it, the witness told me they could hear a very faint humming sound after the object blinked out. The skies were clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the fellows lost sight of it they jumped back into the vehicle and drove quickly to where the object had been sitting, thinking they may be able to get another look at it. But it had vanished. He also said there is a plant, (industrial complex) and this is where the object was hovering over top of. According to the witness the object was not seen flying in any direction as I mentioned above, it blinked out after sitting stationary for the few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report, and again thank you to www.ufology.org.uk for forwarding the sighting to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

Me and my brothers were in my Uncles paddock when we had our first sighting. One evening we saw 2 white round objects moving across the sky. The sky was clear with no clouds and there was no wind. One object was bigger than the other. The objects were white like a bolt of lightning, that kind of light. These objects were silent and we watched them move across the sky until we couldn&#39;t see them anymore. When we first saw them the small object was behind the bigger object but it was moving a bit faster so it over took the big object. The objects moved at a steady speed, not fast or slow but fast enough to travel across the sky in a few minutes. The big object was about the size of a full moon and the smaller one about 1/5th of that size. The objects were quite far away, at least thousands of feet and didn&#39;t appear very high in the sky. We didn&#39;t know what these objects were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this sighting we borrowed my dads camera just incase we saw anything else while we were looking after my uncles house. On the last night at my uncles we were outside, it was a clear night with no wind and my brothers were messing about taking pictures and getting the typical Orbs in them which are mostly caused by moisture and dust, later that night there was an intense fog and we think the moisture in the air caused the Orbs in the photos we got. After being outside for a while we saw something coming towards us flashing a bright white light. The object was round, silent and moving slowly and we didn&#39;t know what it was so we got a picture of it as it was overhead. As we got the picture of it we noticed another one coming which was identical to the first. As this second object was overhead we noticed a smaller white object travelling with it that wasn&#39;t flashing and we took a picture. The way the bigger objects would flash was that the entire object would flash a white light, the light would decrease and go out, then the light would increase and flash and keep doing this in a regular period of time. It was only after we saw these objects that we realized how strange they were. We had never seen anything like them, couldn&#39;t think of anything they could be either. They were low in the sky and moved in a straight line. Its likely that these objects were the same we saw the previous night but this time the bigger objects were flashing and there was 1 more of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then on the last day I was at my uncles house my brothers had gone home and I was waiting for my uncle to come back. I was outside smoking a cigarette, I had the camera with me because of the sighting the night before. I happened to look up and saw something moving towards the house. The object was silent, moving quite fast, wasn&#39;t flashing and looked quite dim. I didn&#39;t know what this object was so I took a picture which came out bad as I was holding the cigarette. I took another picture and the object was in focus. The object moved over my uncles house out of sight. I have no idea what this object was, it was different to the other objects we had seen and I wouldn&#39;t have noticed it if I didn&#39;t look up by chance as the object was silent and wasn&#39;t very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been in touch with Timothy Good and he didn&#39;t know what the objects are and recommended I get in touch with Nick Pope. I got in touch with Nick who also didn&#39;t know what the objects were and said that he wasn&#39;t in a position where he could find this out but that I should send the pictures and my UFO sighting report to the Ministry of Defence. I got a letter from the MOD saying they don&#39;t investigate all UFO reports, they only see if there was any evidence of a threat, they remain open minded about UFOs and that they would file away my report and pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have sent the pictures to Ball lightning experts from this list<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://ae.nsstc.uah.edu/AE/addresses.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> The people who responded to me said the objects aren&#39;t Ball lightning because there were no storms that night and the sighting lasted too long. I have put the pictures onto a few UFO forums hoping someone has seen the same objects and would be able to identify them but so far no one has been able to.<n>

It was almost like lightning, but was bright blue and seemed to come from all directions. Also it seemed to be very close to the ground. That was weird enough but about 3 minutes down the road it happened again, this time appearing a bit more green. About 15 minutes later it happened again near a populated area, quite a way from where the first lights appeared. The third light definitely did not come from the same place that the first two did. There is a chance that the first two lights came from the same place, but it doesn&#39;t seem very likely. We later saw the light again, but from a distance. It couldn&#39;t have been a plane or helicoptor as there was no noise. I don&#39;t know if there was radio outage as we didn&#39;t have it on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No trail<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: Dun sur Meuse, app. 20 miles north of Verdun, France.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before midnight (8th-9th aug.)I saw two objects, looking like regular stars or satelites, moving rapidly towards the southwest. They came in from the northeast and moved in a straight line, at an angle of about 40 degrees upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be regular stars or satelites: small white lights that would never have caught my eyes had they not been moving at such a strange speed. There where moving much too fast for satelites (besides, I&#39;ve never heard of satelites traveling in unison) and way too slow for meteorites, which I&#39;ve seen many times. I most certainly saw no trail of bright glowing material behind these two travelers. They where also moving way too fast for a couple of airplaines in the night. I saw no red of green navigationlights on portside or starboard, nore any blinking lights. Had it been two plaines (fighterjets in formation?) then I would have heard the noise, considering the speed and therefore low altitude. I have seen thousands of airplaines in the night, so I know what they look and sound like. Airplaines at cruising speed move about five times slower then the two objects I saw. Otherwise they must have been about 1500 feet up in the air. What a roar that would haven given! It&#39;s almost impossible to estimate the distance between these two &#39;stars&#39; since I don&#39;t know their actual size and altitude. If I where to draw out the night sky on a big piece of paper and hold it at an arms lenght in front of my eyes, I would pinpoint these two &#39;stars&#39; about an inch apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another thing puzzles me too. The first few seconds I noticed that one &#39;star&#39; was a little behind the other. During the entire passage (about seven seconds) they never changed places. Normaly they should moved right next to each other, because of the change of perspective. Like two racing cars that come in from the left, one a little behind the other, but seemingly driving neck-to-neck when getting out of sight on the right. However, this is only the case with two moving objects at fairly close range. Big objects very far away - like real stars - would not look differently to an observer on eaerth if there where to be on the move. At least not within seven seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this particulair night I was not drunk or tired. I&#39;m a freelance copywriter in the Netherlands. At the time I was having a vacation in France with my wife and 2,5 year old son. This is the first time I report an unidentified flying object, knowing I may look stupid to all of my friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report was, in fact, submitted from The Netherlands.  Some satellites are reported to orbit in formation, e.g. the U. S. Navy &#34;NOSS&#34; satellites, but we agree with the witness that an object that moves across most of the sky in six-seconds almost certainly is not a man-made satellite.  PD))<n>

Then, the light moved in an un-planet or star-like way. On occasion it (there was always only one)would &#39;go out&#39; and then several seconds later re-appear in the same place, then &#39;scoot out&#39;, often in a retrogade, high speed direction; Then it would re-appear at about the same place, &#39;bob up and down&#39; a few tmes, then go out.

They were moving in formation - a triangle shape with the &#34;head&#34; light in the front - forming the &#34;tip&#34; of the triangle.  The other two lights were spread out behind the first one to form a perfect triangle.  They were quite high up, like I said they appeared at first to be stars - but upon seeing them moving in sync we realized they were not.  If they were a color I would have to describe them as slightly Bluish.  The four of us watched them (myself, my boyfriend and my two oldest sons: 16 &amp; 13) as they moved out of sight.  After that we were very excited and watched the sky carefully.  We also saw a light moving across the sky that appeared to change color from White to Red, Red to White.  It moved fairly quickly in the opposite direction of the other formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to be moving rapidly back and forth from north to south and west to east but it would stop in motion occassionaly and we noticed that if we focused in our minds to call it , it actually seemed like it would come closer . It could be an illusion of the mind or it could be our reality . Who knows . The unsual part is when it would move , it went in a pyramid shape direction , so it was forming a triangle in the sky . So someone like us who was viewing it from afar would only see that shape , a triangle . There could have been 3 forming the triangle and light being transferred to each other , but again , I am not at liberty to say . I am only allowed to speak what I saw . I can tell you about other experiences I have had but I do not think they are something to be posted on a web site because there are too many non-believers yet still out there in our world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It moved roughly from the North to the South. We saw it move for several minutes and it was clearly visible there were no wings or tail fins. It was about 20 times as long as it was wide. There was absoutlely no sound. Aircraft later at the same height we were able to hear. There were no trails or lights.

The object was clearly defined, and I could see details of the structure and interior lines although the object seemed to be translucent with a white outline and sky blue interior. This may have been because of the altitude of the craft. It appeared as the size of a basketball at about 100&#39; or less. I estimate that it was atleast 400&#39; long and wide (approx. equal). I suspect that it was 2-5 miles in altitude. Any farther would have made it unbelievably hugh. Each side of the craft (port and starboard) was glowing a rosey pink as if heat was being generated there. There was another smaller craft tailing the larger, and it followed at a constant distance of an estimated 500&#39;. It was dificult to see details of the smaller because of the white and gray smokey trail it left behind. It appeared to be bullet shaped with a shiny, metalic nose and a reflective glassy material (cockpit?) behind that. The rest of the second object was obscured by the smoke. The viewed part seemed to be approx 40&#39; long and 15-20&#39; wide. They travelled west to east along the Arizona/Mexico border. It took from 1.5-2 seconds to cover an estimated distance (to the horizon) of 25 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw that thing today against a clear blue afternoon sky. Oddly, the only difference is that what I saw was much larger- half the size or less of a 737 jet and the body of the craft was white, not silver as depicted on the website, with a silver area/stripe down the centerline. It accelerated from a speed of about 125-150 mph to several hundred mph horizontally at an altitude of about 2500-3000 ft in less than 1-2 seconds. It did not make a sound. I expected a sonic boom. It was not shiny, had no wings, tail rudder or lights. I realize that my description - white craft with grey/silver centerline pretty much describes an airplane. That&#39;s why I did a double take after first seeing it. The color scheme seemed airplane enough...but then the shape of it, the lack of noise/exhaust/contrail/lights and it&#39;s speed and sudden acceleration made me do a double take. I&#39;ve never heard of white being a stealth color either. The sun was at my back and I could see this thing clearly for at least 3-4 seconds before it rocketed out of sight. It was no airplane, chunk of space debris or naturally occurring astronomical phenomena. It maintained level flight at a very high rate of speed and fairly low altitude before I lost sight of it. I had company with me. Unfortunately, they faced the other direction and could only attest to the look on my face in response to seeing this thing.<n>

At first I thought it was a tiny feather drifting with the wind a few feet above my head, but on looking again I realised it was much higher, moving in a straight line and at a steady speed. Not knowing the actual size of the object it was difficult to gauge its altitude against a clear blue sky; I would hazard a guess at somewhere between 3000 and 4000 feet, but that could be way out. The object was white, but with a slightly wispy, almost transluscent appearance which gave it a somewhat  indistinct outline, hence my initial reaction that it was a feather.  I could however just make out a definite structure, the best description I can offer being that it was basically rectangular in overall planform, and consisted of what might have been a lattice of booms, which gave it an appearance rather reminiscent of an old-fashioned TV aerial.  Seen from a long distance this would explain why it looked rather vague and wispy.  It was moving assymetrically, ie set at a slight angle in relation to its direction of travel, which was from west to east. It had every appearance of steady and purposeful foward motion, and remained observable as a white speck receding into the distance for a short time after it had passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There may well be a perfectly simple and reasonable explanation for what this object was, but at the moment my only choice is to regard it as a UFO, by which I imply nothing more than an object, apparently flying, which I was unable to identify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I filed my first report on our glider pilots&#39; discussion group, another glider pilot, who that afternoon had landed in a field some 30 miles to the east of my position, reported that he and his retrieve crew had also seen the same object.  They too were unable to identify it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will certainly email the guy who corroborated my sighting and suggest that he and his crew each file a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for the wind, at ground level it was very light, averaging about 5kts I would say, and was blowing down the E-W  runway with a little right-to-left crosswind component, so I would say somewhere around<n> <n><n> 280-285 degrees.  The object I observed was coming pretty well directly parallel to the runway, and almost overhead of it - I had to crane my neck quite a bit to watch it when it was abreast of me.<n> <n><n> Unfortunately I don&#39;t know what the wind at altitude was; I was down to be launchpoint controller that day and had to  resign myself to spending most of the day on the ground, so only had time for one very<n> <n><n> quick local  thermalling flight to1800 feet, then it was out with the brakes and back down again.  I suppose it&#39;s possible that the object I saw was drifting with the upper wind, but with allowance for wind<n> <n><n> deflection I would have thought its course would have diverged more markedly from that of the surface wind if that had been so.<n> <n><n> Furthermore, its smooth and deliberate progress across the sky was highly suggestive of something that was being propelled and/or under intelligent control - directly or remotely.  Given what appeared  on<n> <n><n> the face of it to be (as far as I could make it out), a somewhat unaerodynamic structure, I would have also expected it to have shown at least some signs of instability if simply being blown by the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I might also mention that in the past couple of weeks there have been other reports of UFO sightings in this part of England.  Very near to where the other pilot landed his glider there have been reports in<n> <n><n> the local press of people having seen strange objects in the sky, see<n> <n><n> <n><n> www.daventryonline.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=696&amp;Ar ticleID=568425<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live some 50 miles to the SE from Shenington, and our local paper also carried a report of some people  in the next town to me having seen some strange lights hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Warm regards  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP #2))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps I should just clarify something regarding the wind direction though - I had described the runway as &#39;E-W&#39; in my reply, because as the runway in use this was the direction of take off and landing.   The object I observed was travelling pretty well directly W-E, ie downwind on a heading of approximately 90 degrees true, and only with a small divergence from the *surface* wind blowing from 280-285 degrees.<n> <n><n> Given the effects of wind deflection I would have expected it to have been a bit more divergent from this if it was travelling with the wind at altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have suggested to the other pilot that observed this object that he and his companions also file reports to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best wishes  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP #3))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter<n> <n><n> <n><n> I understand there is now an explanation for the strange object I saw last week.  I was told there was a news report  about it.  I&#39;ve been trying to trace further information from the BBC website but have not<n> <n><n> come up with anything yet.  You may well have sources you know that you can plug into to find out more particulars.

About an hour ago, I was on the phone with a client, and looking at the western sky.  From above a bank of clouds comes a bright white, flattened oval -- not an airliner, but a disk shape -- flying in a path that would bring it directly overhead.  The object was about 1/8th of an inch wide at arm&#39;s length.  My best guess is that it was flying at at altitude of about 10,000 to 15,000 feet, with a speed of perhaps 200 to 300 MPH -- similar to a jet.  It was elongated to the left and right sides with no fuselage.  I watched it for a few seconds to try and determine what it was, and decided to ask my client if I could call her back in a few minutes.  Outside a few seconds later, I never caught sight of it again.  It was partly cloudy with much blue sky overhead, so I was surprised (and disappointed) when I couldn&#39;t find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am a college professor and joined four college men on the hike near Slate Peak, the highest place you can drive in Washington state in the North Cascade mountains near the Canadian border. The 6,600 feet elevation trail head is at an old air force listening station manned in the 1940s which is now marked by an unmanned observation tower closed to the public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our camp was about five miles north east of the trail head on a very isolated ridge with no other campers for miles and miles. The Pasayten Wilderness is one thousand square miles. While a very large forest fire was burning in an eastern region of the wilderness, we were at a safe distance. The fire was at a much lower elevation about 35 miles east and two valleys and mountain ranges away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first night of our excursion, we were sitting around a small camp fire above the lake looking at a perfectly clear night sky. Then a few minutes after 11 PM we saw a bright light like an airplane in the south east above the mountain ridge skyline about 50 degrees high. It moved like a helicopter, but made no sound. It seemed to be about three or four miles away moving north west, seemingly flying above the Slate Peak observation tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly something shot out of the light. We were astonished. &#34;Did you guys see that!&#34;, I said. Yes, all but one student agreed.  He didn&#39;t bring his glasses and couldn’t see that clearly, but the other four of us all witnessed it. It looked like a shooting star, except it shot out of the airplane-like-light down towards the south east. We immediately thought that perhaps the projectile was a shooting star that just happened to shoot behind the light at the right moment, giving an illusion that the light was the source. Then one student said, &#34;Yea, but what are the odds that a shooting star would appear at exactly that point?&#34; We agreed that the sight was amazingly poignant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then appeared to be moving directly towards us, as if to fly over our lake.  And I said, &#34;It must be a Forest Service helicopter. Put out the fire.&#34; There was a burn ban which I admit we were not obeying. Moments after the fire was put out with a bottle of water, the light turned away from us and moved directly east. It floated lazily, as if taking in the scenery. It did not move like a helicopter doing a job. And there was no sound. The light moved away and faded into the horizon, turning reddish as it  apparently disappeared behind the atmosphere. We witnessed the strange light for about five or six minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to think of what it could be. One of the group remarked that it couldn&#39;t be an airplane or jet because there was no discernable shape, no sound and looked like a single, bight ball of light, like a head light pointing at you. His father is a pilot and he seemed sure that it was not a fixed winged aircraft. We had seen Forest Service spotter aircraft looking for lightening fires all day long and could hear the roar of their engines long before we could see them. We all joked that maybe this light was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I took out my compass and topo map and plotted what I thought was the line of flight. Then I realized that the light seemed to out line the eastern side of the wild fire about 35 miles away. Maybe it was farther away than we thought. So, I told the men that it must have been Forest Service helicopter shuttling fire fighting crews or dropping water or fire retardant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then on Monday evening we had another sighting. This time about 9 PM, after sun set but before you could see any stars, one of the men looked up at the same spot to the east and said, &#34;Look, the light is back!&#34; This time we saw the same intense point of light acting like an airplane flying away. We saw it for about one minute. It certainly looked exactly like the night before, except that we didn&#39;t get to watch it for very long to notice any thing strange. There was not sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tuesday the weather turned to rain and thunder storm clouds obscured the night sky. We later learned that this storm caused some small fires in a valley to the north west of our lake. In the afternoon on Wednesday, we heard a helicopter approaching. Then a large K-Max helicopter flew over our lake tugging a 300 gallon scoop. It hovered over the lake, scooped up water then made a wide turn along the ridge and flew over our camp into the hills to the north to drop water on a small fire caused by the lightening the day before. In about five minutes it returned. The third time we heard it approaching we ran down to the lake to get a close up view. We were directly under the chopper as it hovered. It was huge and make a sound so loud that my ears are still ringing. We noticed blinking lights on the tail and end of the fuselage. It made five water scooping trips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, later we reflected on the contrast between the chopper and the light on Sunday and Monday nights. It seemed even more strange. Unlike the chopper, there was no sound. There were no blinking lights. It moved slow and funny. The projectile shooting out of it. That just could not be a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We hiked out on Thursday to stay at a hotel before driving home to Seattle on Friday. The ski lodge hotel was catering breakfast and lunches for fire fighter crews because their base camp was a half mile away. As I paid our bill, I met a director of the ground crew operations and asked him questions about the type of aircraft fighting the fire. He said that they use Bell helicopters to shuttle the crews and K-Max choppers to scoop and drop water. I didn’t reveal why I was asking him all of these questions, but he ended by referring me to a forest service information officer at a head office in the town of Tonasket.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I asked one more question, &#34;Do the helicopters work at night?&#34;  &#34;Oh, no,&#34; he said.  &#34;They have to be able to see.&#34;<n>

For about two weeks now i have watched many diffrent lights from about 4 miles away on the side of a hill.  At times the light is so bright, it almost hurts your eyes to look at it.  It changes colors, and moves in all directions.  Me and my spouse really didn&#39;t know how to explain these strange lights.  Last night almost directly above these lights was a very bright orange round light in the sky.  As i watched it, it started to move higher and higher.  Then it instantly changed into two lights.  One yellow and one red.  Then like somebody had flipped a switch it was gone.  About 2 minutes later it reappeared in almost the same spot that it first started from.  I have lived in here all my life, and have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They moved slowly across the sky and looked jittery.  What I mean by that, was when compared to a plane or something else, the planes moved smoothly...not jerky. Anyway, we followed them for a couple of minutes, they were straight above us, the the lead one sort of disappeared, the the next one, then the last one.  They were the same size as the stars.  It just looked like 3 stars moving together.  Same light and everything.  Anybody know what it was?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness observed the three satellites, which fly in formation, and which are thought to be part of the U. S.

She called as she read article in the Kelowna Capital Newspaper about a fellow who was requesting witnesses to a sighting come forward. She told me she saw something that was pretty peculiar around 8:30 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She told me it was remarkable to her, so much so that she wanted her neighbors around to discuss what she saw but no one was in the area at the time. she also believes that she may have been the only one who witnessed this object, but of course at this time she hasn&#39;t heard from anyone else yet who may have saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness went on to say it was a perfectly round metallic silver object moving across the daylight sky. The lady also said it was round apposed to being cylindrical or egg shaped and stressed it was as round as a ball. The object was moving in a easterly direction and she got the impression it was very, very distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved at a steady pace, it didn&#39;t stop, it didn&#39;t hover it just kept moving along through the sky until she lost sight of it. She also heard no sound coming from it. No trail or tail was witnessed. She gave a guess at what the size of the object may have been. She took a guess and estimated it may have been the size of a nickel, or at least close after holding out her hand at arms length. She estimates she observed it for approx: 2 minutes before she lost site of it when it went behind the hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for sharing this report with NUFORC.

Enjoying the hot weather, and watching the occasional plane fly overhead. I then noticed a large silver ball floating directly above me higher than most of the aircraft, although I could see clearly that it was a large shiny silver ball. It seemed to shake every now and then, but hovered at the same altitude for about 10 minutes. A large jumbo jet started flying towards it, and the ball started moving up. The plane passed and I watched as the ball continued upwards. The sky was clear and blue except for a few wispy clouds. As the ball passed through one of the clouds the cloud lit up for a split second, as if there was a lightening storm within in, although it was clearly not a storm cloud. The ball became faint as it disapeared until it looked like a small star in the bright blue sky. Then it vanished out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I told the person I was on the phone with that i think a jet just blew a engine, then I noticed a glimmer of metal in the direction the craft was headed, I saw a very large saucer shaped craft desending at 50 degree angle and stop in mid air ,i believe a dozen airline size planes could have sat on its disc , the round craft flew under it and turned 90 degrees and flew out past the large craft and headed up till it went out of sight, then the saucer backed up from the way it came still at that 50 degree angle till i lost sight of it. no detail for the small craft but the big one was huge i&#39;ve watched planes fly thur there for 20 years its surface appeared to be metal thin for its size with a bulged area in the center, I was raised on USAF base, and worked as a law enforcement officer, there was other flight traffic in the area at the time of this sighting, I never told anyone but my family and I could tell it was hard for them to accept so I remained silent, till now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The exact location was about 1/4 mi. S. of CA 78 and 1 mile S. of Camp Pendelton. The light slowly cruised over the freeway at which time I noticed it was composed of 4 roughly faceted egg shaped objects in a very tight diamond formation. Immediately, I suspected a helicopter of some sort, since they often cruise the highway to observe traffic or Marine helicopters out and about. The configuration did not register as a helicopter or any other conventional aircraft. What was observed were the 4 egg shaped objects bobbing up and down with respect to each. The altitude was low, less than 1000 feet. This estimate was due to the fact of the clarity of the surfaces reflecting the sun and the object&#39;s sharp outline against the clear sky. They appeared to be strongly metallic colored ranging from gray to black to strong sun reflection. Each one was alternating in these colors and reflections on different parts which also supported my estimation this was not a single craft. I followed them as they crossed my field of view high in my windshield until lost from sight as they flew overhead. I didn&#39;t hear any typical aircraft sound. There were many cars around me as I stuck my hand out of the window and pointed up. Someone else must have seen it too. After a short time I decided to look into my rear view mirrors and I was then able to see them once again in the same tight formation on the West side of the freeway directly over the city of Oceanside. I am hoping others who had seen this will report it since it was so easily viewed. Perhaps there is a logical explanation since it was so close to a major Marine base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having considerable technical background.

I observed another airliner come into my view, going the opposite direction from my plane. I had a very clear view of the plane for a few seconds as we passed each other. I was surprised to see a completely separate, smaller metallic aircraft positioned just under the commercial jet at the rear section. I have never seen any other aircraft with this craft&#39;s design. Its design revealed an obviously high level of precision, with no visible windows, and some sort of short, swept back wingspan. The craft appeared to be drafting the larger airliner, and very capably flying along with the highest part of its fuselage and tail area approximately 3 feet from the bottom of the airliner. The craft appeared to be a light brownish gold color.

Its outline from the side view could be described as a hard edged, horizontal teardrop.  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n>

So we looked off to the east and saw what looked like a cessna plane and what gets me about this is something I have witness several times before. They look like planes with the same light configuration but they fly way too slow to be up in the air and make no noise what so ever. So there was one coming and this one just had a red light and as it slowly past over you could see that there was another one same thing red light no noise then there was a third one. So as the last one past over it was about two minutes away and my son did not hear anything no sound at all. So I bent over for something and I looked over to the east again and then I seen something to convince me that I truly could not explain it was 3 lights shaped like a triangle and was flying sideways another words the lead light in the triangle was not in the front so it was flying sideways. So I asked my son do you see what I am seeing and he did not see it and I said it&#39;s right there and then he said I only see one light but not three. So I was frustrated by him not seeing the other two lights so I asked him to go get his brother and by that time wouldn&#39;t you know that it disappeared. However it must have flown over Whiteman Air Force Base. So I just wanted to say that since then I have seen other objects since then. But before then since the early 90&#39;s I have seen several planes that have made no noise and fly too slow to even be in the air.<n>

Some time between 1:00 am and 3:00 am, heading east on the 8 or the 10, west of Tucson, we observed what can be best described as 2 &#34;dancing lights&#34; on  the northeast horizon, perhaps a mile or so away, although it was difficult to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were almost halogen like - a brilliant white blue.  It soon became clear these light were affixed to a craft, as they remained in the same relative position indicating they were affixed to a wing.  I remarked upon first sight that the maneuvers this craft was performing were not possible.  It would go from just hovering over ground level, and immediately climb, while spinning, to a couple thousand feet - almost like it was performing.  It then shot straight up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later it reappeared directly in front of us, like two headlights.  It was traveling quite slowly, almost like a jetliner landing.  It was traveling west on the other side of the interstate at maybe 100 feet.  As it passed our lone car, its forward facing lights slowly rotated to point directly at the ground.  Its profile seemed negligable, almost like it was just a wing.  No sound.  After it passed our car and again acsended rapidly (like a few seconds) out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we were well freaked out and contemplating what to do. Maybe a minute later, I saw the same two lights in the rearview mirror following us east.  At this point my girlfriend started crying.  It slowly moved closer and again the lights rotated from a forward position to pointing at the ground.  It then once again rocketed away not to be seen again.<n>

I looked over to the N/NW and saw a bright starlike object. I saw a falling star off to the right of the object and noticed that the object had made a swooping motion as if to avoid the falling star. It then continued to keep it&#39;s position in the sky where I had first witnessed it, yet constantly in motion. I began to think that I was perhaps imagining things so I went to get my wife who was already in bed asleep. She came out on the balcony and watched this phenomenon along with me. It continued to make swooping and other types of motion that I can say without a doubt was not the kind of motion you would expect at that altitude to be an aircraft of any kind. As we watched the object I and my wife witnessed multiple falling stars as well as motions from the object that simply cannot be explained as motion from either aircraft or satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a celestial body would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.

I was watching the northern sky when at about 11:30 pm, I noticed a fall of &#34;stars&#34; rapidly &#34;dropping down&#34; from above in the northern sky. I realized quickly that they were not stars but extremely fast moving lights. My friend then saw them: Four bright lights flying in formation, a straight line. They flew overhead very fast still flying in formation. They were much lower than a normal jet would fly and there was literally no sound. My friend and I jumped out of our chairs and looked up as they flew overhead. We turned around and watched them go South. This took maybe 5 or six seconds and they were out of site that fast. We were both quite rattled. My friend is a former scientist, having been in a UW masters program for chemistry, studying rocket science in a NASA program. I have no science background.

This object, through the binoculars , was flattened, perfectly disc shaped and was wobbling and rolling side to side and up and down.It did grow a little closer to us and it reflected sunlight as it turned.

I was suddenly aware of a bright object in the sky at about 60 degrees from vertical from where I was standing and just slightly higher than the flight path to Luton. At first I thought that this was a silver child&#39;s balloon that may have been released by someone gathering at the nearby Knebworth Rock Festival (Robbie Williams). The sky was clear and sunny with only the jet streams of high civil aircraft breaking an otherwise cloudless sky. I carried on with what I was doing in the garden but kept looking back to see if I could see the light and each time I was able to find it, unmoved from the first location. I started to think that a balloon would have drifted out of sight by now and watched the light for a minute or so more when a second light drifted very slowly across from the direction of the Knebworth festival. This second light passed close to the first light before suddenly accelerating off in a North Easterly direction at a speed I could only guess to be in excess of 2000 mph. It was closely followed by what appeared to be a haze, or very small cloud travelling at the same speed. The first light then began to move before this too took of in the same direction at high speed. There was no noise associated with these objects. During this time I think at least two airliners were on final approach to Luton Airport, one of which appeared to be heading straight for the light before banking left to take up final approach to Luton, and I would say that the flight crew of this plane must have seen the stationary light. In a clear sky I could see high level passenger aircraft taking forever to cross the sky, speeds that were easily much slower than the objects I had seen. In addition, helecopters were going in and out of Knebworth all day and these objects were not helecopters. Coincidentally enough the following day, a school fete took place close to us where a number of silver (and blue and gold) style childs balloons were released into the sky and instantly it was clear to see that the movements of these balloons was completely different to the objects I had seen the previous day. The balloons also disappeared from vision a lot sooner than the lights I had seen which I had been able to see disappearing off into the distance a few miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to draw conclusion that the mass gathering of 125,000 people at Knebworth for the Robbie Williams concert had something to do with the appearance of these objects, particularly as two of them were seen coming from that direction. They most certainly were not balloons, not high level airliners, not helecopters and not flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personally, I am a currently unemployed Computer Programmer aged 39. I have lived at the same location for over 30 years. Stevenage is a town of some 110,000 population so I would be very surprised if no-one else saw at least the stationary light.<n>

I had my compact 10 X 30 binoculars and spotted four separate white circles attached in a circlular formation. I estimate their altitude to be about thirty to forty thousand feet. They were clearly above the cloud layer that looked to be at least twenty to twenty five thousand feet. What struck me as odd was the appearance that they remained fixed in the same location for the five minutes I observed them. I periodically looked at them without the binoculars and they remained straight over my head. I also observed either an orange glow off of one circles&#39;s side or reflection of the sunlight. I was wondering why the jet stream and winds at that altitude was not pushing them away from our location. Maybe these were just some very large weather baloons at a very high altitude. After about five minutes the cloud layer moved underneith their location and obstructed our view.<n>

Then I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving like a plane would so I watched it and it would move only slightly  then be still again.  This caught my attention so I woke my husband up and we got out our binoculars and when you looked through them you could see a row of five lights then almost two sets of two from the center of the object like a cross almost.  I didn&#39;t know who to report such a sighting to so I never called anyone.  I watched it move very slowly over a period of hours approx. 1120p to 330am until it was out of sight.  I don&#39;t know what a satillite looks like and whether it has anything to do with the fires that we have been experiencing, but thats what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given the long duration of the sighting, we believe that the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.

At first I thought it was a plane but then convinced myself it was to far up to be a plane. My next thought was a satellite, but then I saw another one and another one. We counted at least six and they traveled at different speeds and seemed to zig zag every once in a while. We watched for quite a while then they stopped going by. One seemed to travel at a great speed as for as high up as it appeared it crossed the sky quite quickly. It may have a reasonable explanation but none I can come up with. I do not consider myself a believer of UFOs, but I do know it is a big universe and to think in all of that space we are the only one&#39;s would be kind of a stretch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional Information:  Hi Brian, It was pretty late and I was on my to bed. I said Sept. 1 but I meant Aug. 1 of this year (2003). I&#39;ll tackle your questions one at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for meteors, I&#39;m no space expert but I do watch the sky allot and I&#39;ve seen allot of meteors and shooting stars and they definitely not either of those. I mentioned they zig zagged once and a while and I should mention they also traveled in different directions. There were no tails or trails behind them but they were also pretty high up, just a dot of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for time of night it must have been 10:30 or 11:00. My step-daughter and I watched for around 20 mins. I say Aug. 1 but I&#39;m not quite sure as I didn&#39;t think much about it until my wife pointed out the story in the capital News the other day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no pattern to them. They just traveled back and forth. We saw several but I was guessing we were watching 5 or 6 more than once. No stoppage and no sound as far up as they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was kind of funny, earlier in the evening a plane passed over and my father in law told the kids it was a UFO. When we saw the lights we were quite taken a back. We tried to watch through binoculars but couldn&#39;t focus on the lights to get a good look at them. I told the Step-daughter that if they were UFOs then the air force jets should be coming by anytime but they didn&#39;t come. I&#39;m sure what we saw had to have a reasonable explanation but I had to think after I read the story. I would be interested in hearing if anyone else saw these lights. Feel free to contact me if you would like anymore info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On your website I noticed there seems to be allot of activity around the Houston area, what do you think they would be interested in up there?  Take it easy and have a good weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Editor: Canadian Communicator - Paranormal Magazine email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www3.telus.net/public/wilbur8/hbcc_ufo_research.htm<n>

Pugh.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was hiking alone in the Cascade Mountains of Western Washington.  After hiking a good part of the day I reached the summit of Mount Pugh where I set up camp for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in the evening I took advantage of the opportunity to observe the stars since I was away from the city lights. It was about 22:00 I saw three points of light. They were mostly red but also had some white in them. They were below the horizon.  I was looking down on them from a point several thousand feet above them while they were only 50 or 100 feet above the foothills below me.  I could see a faint illumination that they cast on the trees below them. They were bobbing and weaving in a strange kind of dance and they were all doing it in perfect synchronization with each other, almost as if they were physically linked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t take me long to realize I was seeing something very strange and at that instant I had one of those &#34;Oh  Sh%*&amp;&#34; moments.  I felt very uneasy as I was completely alone, at night, in the middle of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of them dropped below a ridge and were out of sight. They reappeared occasionally, sometimes from a completely different direction. This was mountainous terrain and there were literally scores of ridges and peaks surrounding me in all directions. I was looking southwest initially. Sometimes I saw them to the North or East and they would drop back down below a ridge in that direction. The other remained in sight continuously. They seemed to be playing hide and seek with me and I was constantly scanning in all directions, looking for them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes I saw a fourth UFO.  It was just slightly below the horizon to the Northwest and was more distant, maybe several miles.  It&#39;s apparent size was about that of a pea held at arms length. It was more or less round. It was usually red, sometimes green or white. It&#39;s color and luminosity reminded me of a neon light. It would suddenly appear then the light would rapidly fade out in about 2 seconds. Then a little later it would reappear and fade out again the same way. It was always at the same location in the sky. What was really strange was that after I watched it fade I would keep my eyes fixed at that spot waiting for it to reappear but it never did while I was looking there. After maybe 30 seconds I would look away to locate the other 3 UFOs, then just at the exact moment when I looked back at that spot again it reappeared and faded. It was as if it knew the exact moment when I returned my gaze to that spot. This happened several times and it was creeping me out. A few times gold or yellow sparkling lights sprayed out of it. It looked exactly like a fireworks display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this sounds like too much but there was a fourth UFO that appeared briefly. It was a white point of light in the valley immediately below the peak I was on. It appeared to be no more than 100 feet off the ground. It slowly meandered northward up the heavily wooded valley. I could see a few points of light among the trees below that were the lanterns at some drive in camp sites. The UFO came pretty close to some of those. I estimate it was traveling about 30 mph.  I&#39;m certain it wasn&#39;t a helicopter either. There was no sound and it traveled in a kind of tight weaving pattern similar to what the red lights were doing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With so much going on I felt like I was watching a circus.  It was really too much and I just wanted them to go away. After watching for about an hour and a half the 3 red lights were much further away and the fourth one was appearing infrequently. I was tired and it gets cold at night at 7200 feet, even in August. So I climbed into my tent and eventually went to sleep hoping I wasn&#39;t going to be a guest on an alien mother ship during the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always felt comfortable camping alone in the wilderness but now I will have a nagging fear in the back of my mind that I will have another experience like that. If some other people had been with me it would have been an exciting and interesting experience. As I was alone it was just plain scary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two weeks later I went back to the same peak with a buddy (no way was I going back alone!).  One or two of the red lights described above appeared again but they were more distant and they didn&#39;t dance around like the last time.  They just slowly meandered around in the distance.  I pointed them out to my friend but he dismissed them at first.  After they continued to hang around I pressed the point with him and got him to admitt they weren&#39;t airplanes.  I could see it made him uneasy.  He went inside his tent and went to bed.  End of story.<n>

Pugh.|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57514.html|528|ndxe200308| I was sitting on a chair in my back yard enjoying the night sky.  It was very clear and I cannot be exact about the date as far as month and day.  The stars were brilliant.  I watched and I believe the orientation was I was looking up in the southern sky although it was like a ten o&#39;colck perspective.  I watched as a circular light moved from the west to the east very quickly and then stopped dead in the sky.  That brought me to my sharpest attention as I know there are no sattelites or planes that will do that and it was so far distant in the sky that I knew it was not a helicopter or other man made light. It appeared to be situated in the stars yet closer if that makes any sense. It paused for only two or three seconds and then left so fast I guess I would only describe as up and it was gone in about one second.  I sat there and knew that this was not man made. It was not a light created by a spotlight, it was not anything that we made as it moved incredibly fast.  There were no colors and it did not flicker or anything than being a solid white circle. I was not drinking and I do not do drugs and am a law enforcement oficer for twenty two years.  I have kept this to myself except for my wife and close friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It rained most of the way but stopped about an hour south of Tampa. We were heading northbound on i-75 and I estimate the time to be around 9:30pm. We were still not in any metropolitan area, pretty much in the middle of nowhere.Off in the distance i saw a baby blue greenish and white light, spaced apart but on the same aircraft, which i took to be a helicopter. After a few seconds I look again and something about the way it was flying wasnt right. Just then my friend (the one was asleep in the backseat) in the passenger seat says, &#34; do you see that?&#34; I acknowledged it was wierd. A few seconds later it was right over us comming from the west to the east toward the highway at a pretty high speed. As soon as it was directly over us it flipped, reversed and started heading west again finally shooting away. When directly over us it could have been no more then 100 feet way. When it changed directions, i know something was up and just as it was starting to head away i stuck my head out the window to catch a glimpse and could actually see the craft. It was FLIPPING head over end as it turned! It was a greyish dull metallic i could tell. But as too its shape it was hard to make out being that i was doing about 70mph and it too was moving. But probably an oval or saucer. It had a greenish baby blue light on one end and a white light on the other. Me and my friend started yelling at each other ,&#34;DID YOU SEE THAT ((deleted))!&#34; waking my friend in the back who slept through it all. Well there was about 4 other cars around me who all had to have seen the thing too. So thats why i say there are probably plenty of other witnesses. Some even were hitting there breaks when it came over the road. Weird stuff.<n>

To the point where seeing things like I&#39;m about to explain, do not make me think &#34;am I crazy?&#34;........&#34;did I really see that?&#34; or the like. Up to that point of my life I had seen things which people of that age more then often do not see.  I am just trying to tale my story and see if those out there have seen the things I have. The UFO Chasity and I seen back in 2003 must have been seen by someone else.  So after reading this feel free to write to me. Here it is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Back in the summer months of 2003 me and my family member Chasity had walked onto my front porch.  I remember looking over into the field across the way. I had noticed rising up through the foliage of the trees a white light. I had pointed this out to Chasity and we both watched as the light appeared above the trees. It was a ball of light. the ball looked like a glass ball and glowed a dim but bright white light. It was funny to note that the light of the sphere did not shine of the trees and the light was in and of itself. However, the spherehover above the trees. just hanging there. No noise, nothing, the leaves on the trees didnt even move. When we watched it there for a moment, we noticed that in one instant the ball seemed to zip up into the darkened sky. After a little bit of searching the ball seemed to disappear above the porch roof. I am not saying it was a Alien. However, it was not a fire. It was not a plane or Copter or a fire work.....or anything else. It&#39;s nothing I can explain with what I know of the worlds flying contraptions. What I seen was not man made and it is not anything which modern physics can support.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I seen it once more. This time me and Chasity and Donnie were driving north and again it was dark, I say about 9pm to 10pm. It was at that time now late october. On the road, I looked over in a field we were driving by and the sphere was there, over a billboard, but this time it had a stream of light which seem to be shining on the ground. Again, everyone seen it. It wasnt anything man made, I assure you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always believed in life on other planets and UFO&#39;s and all that. I however never thought I would be party to seeing one so close up and so detailed. I am happy I found this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 21 now, chasity is in her early 30&#39;s.  At that time I was 15 and she was in her mid to late 20&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

So by now we are filming this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the red dot begins getting bigger and bigger until it turns into a huge bright white light again and has us all amazed.  So we film it for a minute or so and then we loose track of it while we keep on driving.

This was heard at least throughout the greter Charleston area, and further off possibly... certainly as far as Hollywood SC.  Likely too wide a range to be a thunderclap.  Local Coast Guard  had no idea what it was, a report from the air force base claims they had nothing to generate a boom of this sort in the air  at this time... and that when they perform manuevers that would generate a boom of this magnitude they would do it out at sea.  My expectation is that this was a meterorite that was large enough to make it into the lower atmosphere and generate a sonic boom, but small enough to not hit the ground or to have hit without observed incident.  Perhaps just off coast?  It there was a visible streak or fireball associated I have not heard an account of it.  some of the sky was obscured by clouds, otherwise it was a bright sunny afternoon.  www.NAtlantis.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having considerable technical experience.

Orginial language text at bottom ---  I live in the small town of Mendoza San Rafael in Argentina. On 8/1/03 at approximately 2:10 am something happened that I, nor any of my family or friends that were there, had ever seen in our lives. I don&#39;t usually believe in things such as UFOs, but what I saw was definately out of the norm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard a very loud sound that was unlike anything I can describe. When we went outside we saw something that was round and emitted colors that changed between very strong white, yellow and red. Something like this I had no idea what it was and I first assumed it was a meteor due to its size, but it went across the very, very fast and all we could do is stand there paralysed with wonder as to what this object could be. It continued across the sky and I believe that it impacted the earth some distance away as we felt a tremor and my home shook as though a plane had crashed nearby or something similar. The local news reported it and gave commentary from people of the village who experienced it, but the Civil Defense service explained it as a meteor impact, although a search by the Civil Defense forces with use of airplanes, aerial photos, helicopters, men on horseback and trucks have not been able to produce any evidence of a meteor fall.

My old dog who has a weak bladder woke me up and wanted to go out side to urinate. I went outside in the back yard with the dog. I looked into the eastern sky and saw the same golden light I had seen the night before in the southeast. It seemed to go up or come toward me. I then went into my house to get my glasses as I am slightly nearsighted. I wanted to see if I could get rid of the &#34;flare&#34;/twinkle of the light and perhaps get a better look. The &#34;object&#34; was still there (and still twinkled&#34; with my glasses on, but to a lesser extent) and then moved up and to the left in the sky. Then it dimmed out as if a gas or &#34;jet burner&#34; had went out. It was about 2 or so times the brightest object in the sky, which was Mars. I had not planned to report this again until an experience tonight. I walked to the Post Office to drop a letter off. A man was in an empty parking lot with a Meade &#34;Telescope&#34;. He was charging $2.00 to look at the moon. I paid him and had a look at the cratered moon. I then asked him if he had ever saw anything unusual like a ufo. He said that he never had. But a man who was standing there and had looked before me, said that he had. He then confirmed what I had saw in the night sky over Wilmington. That is what prompted me to write again. Also I am wondering at the odds of me waking up in the middle of the night by my dog on 2 straight nights, and seeing these lights which quickly disapeared? I have looked every night since when I go out with the dog, but have seen nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the bright light in the southeast sky may have been the planet, Mars, but Mars should not move suddenly.  That part of the sighting may have been a perceptual issue.  PD))<n>

We stopped our boat&#39;s engine, and observed the object for about 30 minutes, doing what seemed to us to be surveying the area. We both contemplated what we should do, and decided to move ahead to our destination. As soon as we moved towards the object, it&#39;s glow intensified, and it began to ascend into the sky very slowly, as if to let us pass. We got within 200 feet of it, and it vanished, no sound, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I do not drink alcohol, do not use drugs, and have gown up in the swamps of Louisiana, never having witnessed anything like that before. I travel by plane all over the USA, and I am quite familiar with many different types of aircraft. I am very critical, I don&#39;t believe in beings from other worlds, bigfoot, or ghosts. But I am left baffled at what we saw, and I would like to have an answer to what we may have encountered. My friend is terrified to say anything at all about our experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The second night of the cruiae my friend and I were on the deck and he said he just saw a shooting star but it was very unusual because it didnt have a tail.  I didnt think to much of it because it was very clear that night.  About five minuts later I looked up and saw three white lights to the south.  They formed a triangle.  It was very hard to tell how far away it was.  They stayed stationary for a few seconds then moved rapidly to the east and went out of sight.  Never seem anything like this.  has anyone else on this cruise seen the same thing?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded quite lucid to us.  He actually reports here two separate events.  We have invited him to have the witness to the first of the two events submit a report, as well.  PD))<n>

I pointed to my friend and said &#34;look at that one, its bright&#34; and I  was convinced that it was a shooting star until in made a random course change.  The object looked about the size of an airplane flying high. But the lighting was too bright indicating that it was closer than that.  it moved from the center of my viewable area in the sky to the horizon in about 5 seconds, and made a hard turn to the right through a set of clouds, but continued in the same direction....heading south towards marblehead.  The object looked to have three lights on the front in a triangle shape, the lighting was orange.  It definalty taveled through the clouds because the clouds were illuminated as it passed through.  It moved way to fast to be a plane. I have never seen something move that fast in the sky. Maybe it was a meteor from the sky and I mistook the course correction, or it was something unknown.  But whatever it was, It kinda scares me a little.  I thought I would make an effort to report this in case there was another sighting.  Thanks!<n>

We had left Cozumel Mexico on Thursday July 31st and wereon our way back to Miami. Me and a few friend had just came out onto the front of the ship and were looking at stars. Me and 2 others noticed a light that seemed to be a ship out at sea (a considerable distance away) but the light wasn&#39;t consistant. One second you would be able to see it and then it would go out, and wouldn&#39;t reappear for 3 or 4 seconds. The times varied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were then looking up at the stars again and all saw one huge light come across the entire sky (towards the south) and it seemed to be a shooting star or comet, but the tail following it seemed to be just part of the initial light streaking through the sky, and did not last for more than a quarter of a second. 3 or 4 of us saw it and all yelled &#34;woa&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last thing only I saw, and was kind of akward. I was trying to scope out the planets that were visible, and the only one i was sure about was Mars (being huge and very bright at the time). I was staring towards the north at what looked like a planet that was shifting colours from blue and red. For 10 seconds the &#34;star&#34; was shimmering an inconsistant red colour, and then the next 10 seconds and inconsistant blue colour. The colours were always visible and did not blink, but got brighter and darker some times. It seemed to be very far away. I was staring at it afterwards thinking of what planet it could be, then looked one of my friends for 3 seconds. I turned my head back to the &#34;star&#34; and it seemed to be out of place in the sky in comparison to the others from what i had just been looking at, it was too far to the left. (2 inches from my view, so about this far <n>---------<n> in comparison to what i had seen). I stared at it and it sudenly dissapeared and reappeared where it had first been, back to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
