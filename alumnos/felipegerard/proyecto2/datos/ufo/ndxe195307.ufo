7/15/53 13:00|Nashville|TN|Cylinder|4 to 5 minutes|cylindrical object "examining" trees|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45812.html|2|ndxe195307| cylindrical object &#34;examining&#34; trees<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, I must apologize for any lack of exact location/time. This incident happened to my father and his friend when they were about 11 years old, and the exact year isn&#39;t remembered. I submit this information because I&#39;ve studied UFO reports my entire life and have yet to hear about an object quite like this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and his friend were busy on a summer afternoon building a club house when they began to hear a strange sound. My father describes it as sounding remarkably like a metal object striking a 1/4 full aluminum can, only much louder(he tried several times to recreate the sound, at last using a fork against a 1/4 full can, which he said was very close to it. It would &#34;strike&#34; 4 times, then pause for a moment before doing it again. Naturally they looked around to see what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They saw, only a few feet above the trees, a 20 to 25&#39; cylinder, slightly rounded on both ends, of a dull silver color. It had what looked like helicopter skids on the bottom, and between them, on the &#34;belly&#34;, a strange series of symbols or writing (at his angle, he could only see part of it...it reminded him of chinese lettering). At the rear was a blue light or flame, very bright. Protruding from the bottom of the object was a silverish, bent tube.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they watched, the object floated, very slowly, from tree top to tree top. At each tree, it would stop and the tube on the bottom would touch the leaves (he said it looked as if it were sniffing them in a way). After a moment of this, it would move on to the next tree, all the while making the metallic clanking sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They watched it do this for a few minutes. It eventually turned and left only a slightly faster speed than before. It was soon hidden from sight by trees. They both ran home, frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident fascinated my father and soon UFOs became a life long hobby, which he passed on to me. I Have never known him to lie, invent tales, or even exaggerate. In fact he laments that he hasn&#39;t seen anything like it since. But the object remains clearly in his mind. I will include a drawing I did under his supervision. It is, he says, almost exactly what they saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been trying to track down the other witness, but since this happened 50 years ago it hasn&#39;t been easy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

7/13/53 21:00|Washington, D.C.|DC|Light|3-5 min.|Four of us saw a ball of light come out of the sky, circle a plane then shoot off out of sight.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49403.html|3|ndxe195307| Four of us saw a ball of light come out of the sky, circle a plane then shoot off out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the summer of 1953-4-5.  We were 12-14 years old. One of my buddies&#39; sister was watching tv in their 2nd floor apartment and three of us decided to scare her by climbing up on the porch from the ground below.  The porch looked out over the Potomac river skyline where planes approached National Airport on their landing route.  It was about 8pm.  Two of us had gotten up on the porch and were lifting the last guy up when one of us saw this ball of light coming out of the southwest sky towards a plane coming in for a landing,  along the river, from the west.  We dropped our buddy into the bushes below in our awe of the event but hauled him up right away and sister came running out asking what was going on.  We all watched in amazement as this ball of light went around this moving plane (maybe 100 to 150 mph landing speed) in a huge circle, then shot off in the same direction it had come from and disappeared in a split second.  The whole incident took about 2-3 minutes.  We were so excited we began yelling to people around the community and calling friends and relatives on the phone.  I don&#39;t remember what reaction we got from those folks but we looked in the papers (Washington Post, Daily News, Wash. Star) the next day and found one small article, buried in the A section, about the sighting that claimed it was a meteor out of its orbit.  Well there were 4 of us who knew what we saw and none of us ever heard of a meteor coming out of the sky, making a circle, then shooting back out again.  I&#39;ve probably told this story 5 or 6 times in the past 53 years, when someone&#39;s brought up the subject, but have never reported it or written about it before now.  I&#39;m sure there were others that evening that saw this happening including the pilot, crew and passengers on that plane. I did lie out at night with friends in the late fifties to watch the sky and saw interesting light formations (not airplanes) flying around as well as Sputnik orbiting the earth.    That&#39;s my experience with UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/4/53 21:00|Ogallala|NE|Other|30-45 minutes|Bright white light with no sound, hovering, very fast when leaving at Lake McConaughy|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72924.html|4|ndxe195307| Bright white light with no sound, hovering, very fast when leaving at Lake McConaughy<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to school in a rural school in Ogallala, Nebraska, for just over a year.  I attended part of the 7th grade and the entire eighth grade, graduating in 1954.  This dates the sighting as being approximately between April 1953 through May 1954.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a farmer who lived down the road from us who used to take me fishing at Lake McConaughy, just North of Ogallala.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One day we went in the afternoon and set our lines out in a bay on the lake.  We could see the bushes on the opposite shore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got dark enough, the farmer lit a Coleman lantern and placed an aluminum sheet by it to reflect the light towards the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a light to our left (do not know what direction), that was small like a headlight in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light came towards us very slowly, taking 20 to 30 minutes to become as large as a house and, seemed to be hovering over the end of the bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept asking the farmer, &#34;What is it?&#34;  And he kept replying, &#34;I don’t know, but it isn’t bothering us.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was so bright that it lit the area up like daylight, at which time he said, &#34;We might as well save on fuel,&#34; and he turned off the Coleman lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We fished with the bright light for another 10-20 minutes, when it suddenly left the area at a right angle to the approach it had made.  It took less than 5 seconds to be totally out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our eyes had become accustomed to the light and we had a difficult time re-lighting the Coleman lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should say that there was never any sound from the object.  The color was bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told a Colonel in the Air Force about it when I worked at Cape Canaveral in the 1960’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

7/4/53 14:00|unknown|MT|Disk|10 minutes|Video of Blue Angles airshow from 1953 shows two shiny saucers orbiting a common point.|7/23/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29799.html|5|ndxe195307| Video of Blue Angles airshow from 1953 shows two shiny saucers orbiting a common point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching a TV show on the Blue Angels.  It was there first airshow ever.  It was 1953 and the planes were taking off from an airstrip.  In the background in this color video about 20 degrees up and a maybe 5 miles away are two glowing silver saucer objects circling each other in an orbit maybe  a mile across.  Motion of both objects is clear and they are very distinct from the darker planes of the Blue Angels and the other aircraft visible on the ground and flying by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the first possibility to be ruled out would be blimps, perhaps blimps operated by the U. S. Navy, but that is only a guess.  In 1953, back when the news media still covered UFO sightings, if the objects had, in fact, been genuine UFO&#39;s, the incident probably would have given rise to news reports.   PD))<n>

However, he shared with me a report of a UFO sighting he had in the mountains (mountain community) NW of Colo. Springs, CO. It was about 1953 when in his early 20&#39;s. He was at a friends house (his college teacher) and they talked all night about studies, not realizing the late hour. He left just before sunrise as the sky was just becoming light. When they walked out the front door together they were startled and dumbfounded by a huge UFO hovering about 40 feet directly above the house. He could only tell me that the craft was big beyond description. It was so big and so close that it blocked out the immediate view of the sky. Like a giant blimp right on top of you. He could see every little detail of the under belly of the craft. Not a single sound could be heard. They looked at it for several seconds and he said it then just instantly disappeared before their eyes. He could not give explanation how this huge UFO disappeared but said it was the most unnerving experience ever he had. He later speculated to me that the UFO either cloaked itself or maybe shifted into another dimension as he did not see it move before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
