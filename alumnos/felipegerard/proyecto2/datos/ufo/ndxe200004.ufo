It took me about 5 seconds to realize what I was seeing.  When I was finished, I grabbed my camera and went outside for a better look.  Since I live in an apartment building on the second floor this took me about 3 minutes to get outside and down to the corner of the building.  When I got to the corner of the building I seen the object still traveling slowly in its original flight path in a south/easternly direction.  Only this time it had changed color to a dull white and in both colors, it was slightly &#34;fuzy.&#34;  It moved at the same speed to a part of the sky and then stopped.  It stayed there for a moment or two and then moved north to another portion of the sky.  It was just above the cloud line.  While it was moving I was making attempts at taking pictures of this craft.  It got to another portion of the sky and then stopped again.  It stayed there for a moment or two as if waiting for the clouds to conceal it.  It then disappeared in a flash.  I personally think I seen the craft shoot off to the east. it.  I seen a special on Fox T.V. last week and it resembled one of the &#34;plasma&#34; ships I seen on the show.<n>

We saw a grey disk come from the right at remarkable speed. It was moving up and down in a wave like motion. Then it stopped in mid air! It was under the lower part of the clouds because we could see it was grey and saucer shaped. It stopped, shot downward...hovered and wobbled.... (no noise) shot up...stopped... and continued on out of site. I have NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS! My friend was in the Airforce and agreed that he never saw anything like it. This was too big for a bird and way too fast.This could not be a plane because it stopped in mid air, and there were no lights on it. This was definately a UFO. I feel so fortunate I was able to witness this.<n>

Object had faintly illuminated corners almost as if reflecting surrounding city light. Area between corners was dark but yet a different hue than the surrounding sky.  As object passed in front of stars or mountains it blocked them out. Object was traveling approximately 4-6 miles away in a line that appeared to be over the wasatch mountains.  It was traveling fast but not at break neck speed.  It moved in a straight line and made no sound at all.  I lost sight of the object as it passed behind a small group of trees.  It did not come out the other side of the trees.  There is a small canyon that is in a line behind where we were standing and the group of trees.  I figure that it must have turned up the canyon or changed direction fast enough that we would have been looking in another area than where it actually was.<n>

We were on an empty Golf course. The lights looked similar to stars. Except these stars were moving at considerable pace. They seemed to be moving within an invisible rectangle. They were very far away. Their seemed to be flashes as they zipped off to another part of the triangle. Their was no noise. Eventually the lights dispersed. A light came over the sky towards us and split into two. As the two white lights went directly over our heads we noticed green and red lights where the wings of a jet would be, their was again no noise, no wind and then they were gone.The night sky was just on the turn from pitch black to dark blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have seen the movie STAR WARS Return of the Jedi and the scene where Luke Skywalker is on the new death star and he is looking out at the combating fleets then that is the nearest description to what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first observer was aged 24 male and worked as a night porter.

While playing a medieval type re-enactment game, on 4/29/00  Myself and at least 5 others witnessed this event.  I was looking up at the sky waiting for a sword combat to be worked out and I noticed a light high up in the sky. (I used to fly planes and I am currently a student at an accredited aeronautical school).  I first figured it to be a plane due to the close proximity of the sighting location to the Pittsburgh International Airport.  I then however noticed a second light directly behind the first and they were moving the same speed as each other.  I then believed the objects to be in a formation at high altitude.  I then noticed a third light somewhat down and back from the second I noticed.  This formed a sharp triangle formation. (This still could have been military aircraft flying in a formation)  However,  When this triangular formation flew infront of stars, the star was blocked from vision until the object had passed.  This suggested a definite mass in between the lights.  I then began to look at it as a triangle.  These lights could not have been an aircraft, because the formation was spread quite far(suggesting a large object).  Had this been a jet on a very low inbound approach, the jet would have passed over us at about 100 feet and the noise would have been deafening. (So an airplane is ruled out).  The mass blocking the stars suggests that this was not 3 aircraft in a formation at high altitude.  This leaves only one classification: (Unidentified Flying Object).  At least 5 others witnessed this event, one witness in a different location than myself and the others.  I am also sure, that Pittsburgh International Airport must have picked up this event on their radar.  That would be a logical place to start an investigation.<n>

Looked up in the sky to find a target star in Ursa Major when I saw due East at around 1,000 feet a sauces shaped object hovering abnd bobbing gracefully in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an Amateur Astronomer and on Saturday night 5/29/00 (sic),  it was the first clear night in a while over the New York area. I was trying out my new 150mm refactor telescope and I was searching for star clusters near Ursa Major. I started to set up the scope at 9 P.M., and I aligned the scope to Polaris, and was setting up the tripod for 1/2 hour at the most. I decided to search for M13 in Hercules, but it was straight overhead at R.A 16hours, and I decided not to bother since the scope would be inproperly positioned for a decent view. (Too low to the ground on a small tripod.) The time was approximately 9:30 P.M. I then decided to search for M51 in Canes Venitaci when the neighbor turned on the garage light and I waited for the light to turn off. I went into the house at this time to get a cup of coffee and proceeded to got back out to the yard after the garage light went out. I started to view in the scope at a 45 degree angle due East. After searching around a bit I saw a white rotating streak in the field of view which was spiraling but figured it was a meteor falling to Earth. No problem, a typical event to see as an Amateur astronomer. After that I pointed the scope at the Star, I believe it was Altair or Arcturus. Not sure cause I didn&#39;t have the map with me. Anyway, I decided to focus the scope on the Star to see how much cromatic distortion the scope had. After all that, I decided to stop viewing. When I got off my chair and stood up, I looked at the sky for incoming clouds and saw some coming from the West. When I turned around to the East, I saw an object, rather large hovering and moving East. The object looked disc like but it was a dark shaded craft, black/dark gray. It had 4 lights, 2 red horizontal lights pointing North/South, and the other 2 lights were green pointed East / West (toward me). The lights were mounted at exact opposites to each other. The object was rather low, around 1,000 feet and was the size of a plane. The lights did NOT blink, and the craft or object made absolutely N! O NOISE. The object was hovering but moving slowly toward the East in a bobbing up and down fashion. There were 2 slow bobbing actions while it was in  my view. It did that twice, while moving East and then it slowly moved East to the horizon and over the neighbors tree and out of my viewing sight. This sighting occurred at the 10:30 P.M. time frame. I saw it for around 10-15 seconds. I immediately went into the house to tell my relative (mother) what I had saw. The time was checked at 10:34 P.M. I was not abducted cause I had a strict account of the time. I started setting up the scope at 9:00 P.M. and I was out there for around 1.5 hours. I did not wear a watch. I used the kitchen clock for all time references. Though I live near an airport, all the planes move from South to North, and North to South always. There was never a plane moving in the West to East direction here and I &#39;ve been living here since 1969. The only aircraft were helicopters, but they make lots of noise when they come over here. THe object seemed to have appeared suddenly cause I didn&#39;t notice it come over my head from the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness has indicated that the event occurred on 29MY00.  We believe he intended to indicate Saturday, April 29, 2000.  We have taken the liberty of amending the date, predicated on our assumption.  PD))<n>

Stayed in that location for approx 45 minutes then disappeared and a few minutes later was spotted farther west of my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could not identify any specific shape, from my location all I could make of it was a pulsing light. On occasion it would pulse extremely bright. When observed through binoculars it was as though I was looking at the spectrum of colors and they were brilliant and changing constantly.  The object was moving in all sorts of directions. At times it would rock back and forth and then figure eight patterns. It would drop straight down then shoot straight up. It would stop just as quick as it was moving. In both locations it was making same movements.  After it moved to the second location it slowly moved to the west until I could no longer see it with clarity. My background is as follows: I am 40 yrs old, retired Air Force now working as a computer technician. My wife also witnessed the object, her background is as follows: She is 40 yrs old, served 6 yrs in the Air Force from 1986 to 1992, has worked retail prior to and after Air Force. My neighbor also witnessed object, he is in construction and I&#39;ve known him for 2 years.<n>

I spied to what I thought was a meteor or a shooting star, when this &#34;star&#34; or &#34;meteor&#34; started to move in a line, then jumped all over the sky.  There were abour 3-5 lights in a row, it may have been one &#34;space craft&#34; or maybe more in a line. But the lights kept getting brighter, and brighter and brighter.  So bright they began to hurt my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after the big flash of light occured the light started to dim then it disappeared.  Two minutes later, it came back and zoomed back and forth across the sky.  This lead me to believe that this was not a shooting star or meteor.  This &#34;craft&#34; appeared over the houses across the street in the west direction.<n>

I had put them down and was looking up at the Big Dipper, and just then, I notice a faint object moving just below Dubhe (alpha Ursa Majoris).  This is not a jet or an airplane, it is much higher, no blinking lights, like a satellite would look crossing the sky, and I am a fairly seasoned sky watcher and I know what satellites look like and this appears to be one.  And I see that it is moving from NW to SE across the face of the Big Dipper and so I pick up the binoculars and find it and all of a sudden I see 3 of them in my binocular (10 x 50) field!  At this time they are almost straight overhead.  The original one was the brightest and the others were a little fainter, you would not of been able to see them naked eye, only with the binoculars.  The fainter 2 were traveling at the same speed as the brighter one and they appeared to be ahead of the brighter one.  They all traveled together from NW to SE and of course they disappeared as they reached approximately 45 degrees above the horizon due to the city lights.  This was for real folks!  I was alone and so there are no other witnesses but I am a perfectly normal sane guy that was just out stargazing.  I don&#39;t think satellites travel in 3&#39;s like this but maybe they do.  Does anybody have an explanation? thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have had several reports similar to this one over the last week, or so.  We believe they may be yet another launch of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellites, which fly in formation in a triangular pattern.  This is only surmise at this point, however.  PD.

I always smoke outside, never inside; but, I do not ever expect to see anything strange.  Barksdale Air Force Base is about three miles south of my house.  Generally, aircraft are flying about here quite frequently.  At 10:28 p.m. there were no planes, and I was thinking only of the show about to start.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing directly East.  There are some street lights in backyards which illuminate trees and yards that surround my yard.  Suddenly to my left, North, I noticed something entering from behind me into my field of vision.  I turned my head to the left, North, to see something about four times the size of an eagle in flight.  It was light or off-white colored.  The shape was that of a large bird or boomerang.  Immediately, I thought, it&#39;s not a bird, maybe a big kite.  Although there was no wind, and it was travelling about the same height as the Blue Angels were a week and a half ago when they frequently flew over this same backyard preparing for their two day air show at Barksdale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind quickly returned to the idea of it being a bird, but it was way too big to be a bird.  And, I wanted to see wings flap.  Rather, it just soared without any flapping.  At that time, I started to panic and think UFO because I realized there were absolutely no lights, or sounds associated with it.  I lost vision of it because of a tree line.  Although, after losing sight of it, I did move around in the yard hoping I could spot it, then became fearful and ran inside to tell my son.  It was 10:30 when I was back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a light colored boomerang shape soaring across my backyard at 10:28 p.m. on April 28, 2000.  It was completely silent and perhaps 200 feet above me.  There are street lights inside two neighboring yards which illuminated it.  When it first came into my field of vision I was facing East, and saw something approaching from behind me which was West, and to my left, or North.  It seemed at first to be the size of a huge bird, perhaps four times the size of an Eagle&#39;s wingspread.  But, there was no sound of wings flapping.  And, there was only the movement of it travelling straight across from West to East soaring, not flapping wings.  That&#39;s when I relized that it was not a bird.  Of course, when I had initially thought of it perhaps being a bird, I also was thinking it was the biggest bird I had ever seen.  At that time I knew I was losing sight of it because it was approach a tree line which I knew would obscure it from my sight.  I quickly moved around the yard to try to catch another sight of it, but did not.  I knew that because there were absolutely no lights, nor sound, that it might have been a UFO.  I rushed inside to tell my son, and saw that it was then 10:30 p.m.  I estimate that I was looking at it soaring past me for about eight seconds, no less than five, and no more than ten seconds.  I am about to return to the yard to smoke again, and hope I get to see this once again, but I rather doubt that I will.  Silent, no lights, boomerang shape.  I only could view the underside of it from my vantage point.  Thank you.<n>

I looked skyward and saw a blue and saw a blue cigar shaped object streak from an easterly direction to the west, at a phenomenal speed.&#34;))<n> <n><n> <n><n> On that evening I had just returned home and was listening to the news on the radio in my car.  The time was 10:06 when I got out and looked at the night sky.  First off to the South then off to the west then I turned to walk to the front door and glanced to the sky once again.  This time I was looking Northward.  Just as I glanced up an object appeared.  The object was bright blue with a slight aura of lighter blue around the entire object.  The object was shaped similar to a cigar but was slightly narrower at each end.  It was then that I realized that what I was looking at was an aircraft of some nature.  It was traveling from an easterly to a westerly direction.  The nose of the craft was slightly higher than the rear and it was definately climbing.  The rate of speed was phenominal!  The craft disappeared in a blink, as it had appeared.  There was no sound.  There were no lights.  The time frame of the sighting was very short, one second or so.  The amazement factor makes it hard to get closer time wise. I am a wife, mom, grandmother, great grandmother, former business owner and have some college education. Mr. Davenport, once I filed the report with you I put the sighting out of my mind, so if the date is in error please forgive me.  The time is stamped forever. I hope this will be helpful.

It was to my right (east) and I saw it through my windshield for about 1.5 seconds.  (I have a compact &#39;92 Mazda pick-up).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first impression was a very fast aircraft, which I rejected because the nav light should have been red and, given the brightness of the light, an aircraft with such a nav light would have been flying too low for such a fast speed.  I looked at the vehicles over in the northbound express lanes to my immediate left but there were none which could have been going so fast as to cause such a reflection on the interior of my windshield, nor did I see any obvious green lights on the vehicles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me, the object was decidedly green.  I also had the impression of a flat trajectory, and it left no trail.  I also had the impression that it was wider than just a point of light.  This incident was tucked away in my mind until I heard a portion of Mr. Davenport&#39;s interview last Monday night on the radio and he mentioned this incident.  Unfortunately I didn&#39;t hear much of the interview, however, since I tuned in at the last sentence.  Incidentally, I was returning from a lecture and had not consumed any alcohol that Friday night (and I take no other mind-altering substances!).<n>

I glanced up and saw the brightest object I&#39;ve ever seen speed by between two tall trees.  It was not high in the sky, like a falling star.  Planes fly over all the time so I have an idea of the size of aircraft related to distance and sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was well within the atmosphere and made no noise!  It was definitely going faster than the speed of sound but no sound followed.  There was no tail of light.  I don&#39;t believe it was a meteor or it would have landed on the houses nearby.  It was going in a horizontal position in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I, together with a co-investigator, conducted an in-depth, on-site interview of the witness, and we consider both the witness, and the information she provided, to be highly reliable.  Subsequent analysis of the data, combined with information provided by other witnesses at different locations, indicates that the object probably was traveling at approximately 2,000 miles per hour, and was at an altitude of approximately 2,000-3,000 feet above ground level.

That night I was working late preparing month end reports.  On the way home I was entering onto 599 eastbound from the East Marginal Way on ramp.  Just as I crested the hill of the on ramp a &#34;white&#34; ball flew over my car from back to front.  I could see burning chunks of material trailing behind it.  It was traveling very fast and appeared to be very low.  I recall thinking to myself that it was either very low or very large.  I felt that it was too low to completely burn up.  I expected it to hit the ground but realized it was traveling horizontal.  It appeared white hot to me.  There was no accompanying sound that I can recall.  However, I did have my radio on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. I reported this sighting to Peter on the Ernie Brown Show, KOMO Radio.<n>

The size was rather large (about the same size that a commercial aircraft looks when it first takes off and flies over you).  Lights on the craft were several colors.  There were at least 3 that formed a triangle shape and 1 in the center.  Was quite an impressive sight.<n>

The object was lit on it&#39;s underside, but only in a pattern of a rod. I could tell it had shape outside of the lights appearing on its underside. I witnessed the object for a duration of about 3 seconds before it disappeared, the lights appearing on it were lime green in color and I estimate it flew at about 30,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 8:38pm CST, on Thursday April 27 when I witnessed the object. I met a girlfriend of mine in the parking lot of my apartment complex, and while she was talking with my best friends fiance(they also live in my complex) I witnessed a triangular object moving at incredible speed from the north to south. The object was lit on its underside in the shape of a rod, but I could make out a black triangular shape outside of the lit area. I could see the object moving for about 3 seconds, then it seemed to just disappear. There was no clouds in the area to hide in, so where it went is beyond me. The speed was incredible, in the couple of seconds I witnessed it it covered a good portion of the sky. To compare in speed, I witnessed the space shuttle coming back in orbit a couple of months ago, it took about 30-35 seconds to cross the horizon. If this object would have stayed visible it would have cleared the horizon in less than 10 seconds. I was fully expecting to hear a sonic boom. My best guess of the size of the object is about 3 times of the size of a 727(in comparison to a 727 flying at 30,000 feet, like this object appeared to be flying at). It definitely dodn&#39;t appear to be a meteor, becuase of the color, size, direction of movement(it moved in a staight line). It was definitely a strange site.hhhhhhhhhhhhhh<n>

It had four bright white lights in a row angled downward. At first the lights looked like there were straight across, but then they looked like they were angled downward. The craft appeared to be spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night as I was driving up Malvern Ave, entering Hot Springs, I saw appear from my left a very bright object. It was on the Horizon line that is defined by the sky and mountian. There is a radio tower  on the horizon to the left and the Hot Springs Tower to the right up on the Mountain. This is the flight path for planes going to the airport, and I always see planes going up and down between the tower and the radio tower. Also on the mountian above there are cars that drive along the mountian, and sometimes for a few seconds you can see the headlights or tail-lights, and it looks weird if you you don&#39;t know what it is. But this was not a plane or a car. It was twice the size of a plane, and I was a few miles away. If I held up my thumb at arms lenth, my thumbnail was about the same size as what I saw. As the object flew from the radio tower toward Hot Springs tower it flew very fast. It made it in about five seconds. And when it was by the Hot Springs tower, which glows with a few orange window lights, and looks like a UFO at night. It hovered a few seconds and was about the same size as the lights in the windows of the tower. It was a little bit away from the tower, and I could see the four bright window lights twinkling. The craft appeared to be spinning. I have seen simular objects appearing just over the mountians. Once I saw the object and the four lights kind of angled downward. As I looked at it a few seconds, long enough for me to think &#34;I know that&#39;s no plane!&#34; it blinked out.<n>

4/27/00 21:00|San Felipe, Baja de California (Mexico)|||3+/- min|Something in the night sky!|5/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12815.html|31|ndxe200004| Something in the night sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Vancouver BC, Canada, where I am writing to you from. I returned home on Sunday, after spending a couple of weeks in San Felipe, Baja de California, Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On April 27, the night before we left, we were sitting outside our tent-trailer in a campground by the beach in the sea of Cortez(Mar del Sol)at approximately 9/9:30 pm, when my 9year old son- who was looking to see falling stars- called out.  I was with my mother ((deleted)) and my father ((deleted)). As we all looked up, my father shouted out loud: &#34;Look up, everyone look up in the sky!&#34;. Other campers, from San Pedro (LA) California,  who camped beside us, also witnessed the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, explaining what we saw might not be so easy but... I will try anyway!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially we saw a V shaped formation of extremely bright lights travelling at an incredible speed towards<n> <n><n> north-east. This lights mantained an incredibly perfect and fixed relationship to each other for a while, to the point that my mom said: &#34;they are like snow gheese&#34; (Lit by what?). After a few seconds some of the lights- which seemed to have an aura or glow about them- made some strange right to left and left to right movement, like a shuffling a very quick and perfect shuffle, to them form a perfectly straight line before reassuimg the V shape. We kept looking up till we could no longer see them/it and the whole event must have lasted at least 3 minutes. I have worked in the film industry for years and edited with video special effects... I have looked up at the night sky many times in my life, admired the stars from many corners of the globe.   I have seen satellites, planes, birds, Northern Lights, fireworks, falling stars (and so have my parents) but this time we all agree, we have seen something that we cannot explain!<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you wish to contact me please do:  ((deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS: On Thursday Night I saw a show on the Discovery Channel titled: &#34;Into the unknown&#34;, The lights shown seen and witnessed by hundreds of people over Phoenix, Arizona and the V formation reported were exactly like the ones we saw over San Felipe, Baja de California on April 27/2000 the only difference was the speed of travel and the shuffling.  The brightness and spacing looked identical!!<n>

While I lay there on my blanket relaxing and staring at the stars an object that looked just like a star and was so high it could have passed as one was slowly moving across the sky, it just slowly moved across the sky for a minute then suddenly vanished. Not knowing what I had just seen I continued to stare up into the stars. approximately 10 minutes later It appeared again only going the opposite way. The 2 objects I witnessed that night were going way to slow to be a shooting star or comet. It could have possibly been a satellite but then why did it suddenly disappear and then appear again going the other direction. I now know the truth that we are not alone and that the government has been hiding the hard evidence for many years.<n>

The object was almost vertical above me moving rapidly from east to west in short bursts.The golf course is near Waterkloof Air Force base. At first it looked like a weather balloon but it was very high and moving to fast to be a balloon. Due to the fact that the object was high and fast my friend only caught a short 3 second glimpse of the object himself. I eventually lost sight of the object. The object remained stationary at one time, that&#39;s when i first noticed it.<n>

My head would not allow me to admit that this was anything other than a government experiment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had rented a car out of Palm Springs, Ca., to drive too San Francisco and fly back to Mass.  I was about a half hour out of Palm Springs, northwest on RT 10. @ approx. 9am.  I was on a long stretch through the desert that seemed never ending.  A &#34;very distant&#34; mountain range off to my left.  It was so far away, it looked small.  But I knew it was hundreds of miles away.  There was a car in front of me about 1 mile ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I happened to notice, all of a sudden, something in the air almost above me.  I leaned forward too look out, and up, and off to the right side of my car.  About 200-300 feet in the air was a perfect triangle shaped object just hovering there!  I said, what ((is that)), and slammed on my brakes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed a car about a mile ahead had pulled over.  (The only other vehicle in sight)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened my door and got out to see this.  It was a triangle about the size of a small plane!  It was a dull black color like I have never seen before.  No windows, no lights, no rivets to support it’s construction (very smooth), no sound, no movement.  It was thicker in the middle, but didn’t look big enough for a person to be in it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, this is the part that has been unsettling for me.  Next to the object was a capsule hovering next to it maybe a few feet away from the craft.  (Not Connected)   Looked like a Tylenol Capsule two tone colors and about 3 feet long!   Half was gray and the other half was purple of sort.  Keep in mind these colors were very dull with no shine to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft rotated about 90 degrees, as did the unattached capsule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it shot off toward the mountain range at a speed that was unbelievable.  It went up and over the mountain range and was gone!   The mountain range was &#34;far&#34; away.   It took about 2 seconds from the time it shot off, until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The unattached capsule stayed with it.  No Noise,  No air stream,  Nothing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got in my car and drove on.  I turned up the music and told myself it was a government thing, and tried to forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the years I have read about UFO sightings, waiting for one to describe what I had seen.   A lot of triangular shaped crafts, but &#34;never anything about a capsule&#34; somehow held close unattached, maybe by magnetic science.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed and lack of noise was unbelievable!<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this happened in about 40 seconds!<n>

It did not leave any trails, nor were there any signs of propellers.  It made no noise and strangely did not cast a shadow as planes do.  It disappeared in the blink of an eye but i was able to observe it for a few minutes.  It did not appear to have any lights and as it was not dark you can see plane lights even in the daylight that is why i thought that was terribly wierd.  It almost appeared to hang in the air.  Not blimp like moving.  It was sortof just hanging for a few minutes and then shot off.  I was on my way to work at Stantec Engineering.  It was flying lower than a plane would fly.  Like as low as they fly when they are near the airport.<n>

The UFO had white flashing lights at the base and they seemed to be rotating around the base.  As I approached Canyon Dr. (one block west of Naperville road) I saw the UFO bank so that the base was upside down.  It picked up speed and disappeared in the northeast sky.  I was not afraid of the sighting. That night I dreamed about an implant being put into my right upper arm.  In the dream I was not afraid and the humanoid alien put the implant in was very friendly and I felt no pain.  The object in my arm was verified by three people, one of whom is my massage therapist who has worked with me twice a month for approx. two years. I am a Masters Degree level social worker.<n>

It had no tail, was not traveling that fast, and had a sharp intensity of color.<n>

I was moving west on my plant when I noticed something that looked like a mist or a cloud but moving. It was heading south to north at a pretty good pace.  From where I work you can see the planes taking off at DFW airport. It seemed to be coming from that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched this whatever it was coming across in front of me I saw that it angled to the east toward me then back north.  I would say it was maybe a half mile away when I got a good look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mist or cloud turn toward me one more time showing me what looked to be a flock of birds but was not.  They flew in formation there 12 to 14 bright gold objects. It was still to far to tell the shapes for sure.  Also it was almost midnight.  The sky was clear and a good moon shown bright.  They were not very high up either I figure no more then 100 feet not much more.  As they turned back west it was as if they became the mist or cloud again.  I could still see the movement for another minute or so then lost it as I moved to get a better angle on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought about letting you know sooner but was not sure till I heard you on Art Bell talking to the to ladies about almost the same thing I saw except the mist or cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is the what I saw that night.<n>

It wasnt moving but hoovering..motionless. It could have been even slowly rotating. It was thin..but.huge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to my car in the company parking lot..after work, and saw airplanes descending in flight patterns toward Ohare Airport. I entered my car and drove eventually in a westerly direction which would have been perpendicular to where one of the planes would have been as it descended very low toward runway paths.  From my car as I drove, I turned to view this extremely huge aircraft. It was very low to ground..only a couple of blocks up.  It was much, much larger than a 747...It looked man-made..but what caught my attention even more..was that it wasnt moving...It seemed to be fixed in one position...almost as if it was some kind of &#39;platform&#39;.  It was well lit...It even seemed to be slowly rotating...It was shaped similar to a very thin fusalage with very long wings. I cant remember if it had any engines..I dont remember seeing any.  I slowed my driving, but for some reason, I didnt stop..and finally the aircraft went out of view.  I definitely felt I had seen something futuristic..but it didnt seem to be a spacecraft.  It looked as if it was some kind of a huge bomber or observation vehicle.  And, again....it didnt move..and it made no sounds.  I think it even cast a shadow on the homes below from its own colored and white lights....Thats all I remember.<n>

In May of 2000 while coming back from delaware on the highway we were driving along when something had caught my eye in the sky. i looked up and noticed this craft maneuvering like no craft i have ever seen do before. it moved at a consttant speed, seemingly going the same speed as the car. so i pointed this to my friend and he was like what the....? then all of a sudden it jetted off at extremely high speeds. we couldn&#39;t believe our eyes. my friend told me he had never seen something like that before. i told him that i have but never during the day.<n>

At the time I was living in simms, MT, and had a girlfriend that would sneek accross town and see me late at night. That night on her way over she told me that she had seen a UFO.  I was almost sure that she was making it up or that she saw a plane. It was dark and about 11:30 at night and we were in the backyard of my house talking when she pointed to a field about a mile away.  I looked over and I saw a white beam of light that was pointing straight down onto a field in the distance.  At first i thought it was a helicopter, but then i realized that wahtever it was, it was not making any sound whatsoever. the &amp;quot;craft&amp;quot; sat there for a few short minutes and the light that was shinning down on the field suddenly dissapeared as if it were turned off like a light switch. I waited to hear something take off or noise after the light dissapeared but there was nothing.. it was just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was scared and there are only two thing that I believe that it could have been. The first was miltary craft, like the black secret helicopters that dont make any nose that government might have, or I saw a ufo. The Memory is still pretty clear and I believe that I had a ufo encounter that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/24/00 23:15|Eagle River|AK|Light|60 seconds|Far east of Eagle River, spotted a star and 2 lights in the sky between 2 mountain peaks.  One of the lights was red, one was white.  T|5/3/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12709.html|48|ndxe200004| Far east of Eagle River, spotted a star and 2 lights in the sky between 2 mountain peaks.  One of the lights was red, one was white.  The star was the largest light and it was white.  The red light began above both the others, then descended in a fairly straight line to be below the others, then moved north to be directly under the one white light, which was to the left of the star in my view.  Then the red light disappeared; just winked out.  Then the white light above it winked out as well.  I checked for haze or clouds, but there were none and I continued to see a clear view of the star.  On our way driving out, we saw a white flash of light from the left of the road (south), but were unsure what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had what I believe may qualify as a UFO sighting just 45 minutes ago. My friend, ((deleted)), and I were driving, trying to get away from town and out and about. Went down Eagle River Road. Eagle River is a town about 10 miles outside Anchorage. We took this road ... it&#39;s pretty long. I need to gauge it. I remember hitting the odometer on our way out and noting the time. Anyhow ... it dead-ends in the midst of mountains, part of Chugach State Park. We stopped and ((deleted)) said she had to go, so I took the time to step out and gaze at the stars, hoping that maybe I&#39;d see some planets as I know they&#39;re about to align. Didn&#39;t really expect to, since we&#39;re so far north ... spotted a satellite in the southern sky. Turned my gaze to the east and saw 2 white lights and a red one. At first, I assumed they were stars or planets. The red one began to move. It was above the other two, then went downward and below, then crossed under the white light on the left. Then it disappeared. The white light above where the red one disappeared also disappeared. I thought that perhaps they were planes that went behind a haze or clouds or something, but the one star that was in the same vicinity had never disappeared. As the red light was descending, I remember waving my arm at Trista, who had jumped in the van, and saying, &#34;((deleted)), come here and look at this! ((deleted)), come here and look at this!&#34; She absolutely refused to get out of the van. I stayed and watched the sky a few moments after the two lights winked out, but saw nothing more, so returned to the van and asked why she hadn&#39;t come out. She said she&#39;d had a terrifying feeling and didn&#39;t want to get out. She&#39;d jumped in the van and locked the door just before I&#39;d noticed the strange movement of the lights. When I got back in the van, the time was 11:45. I can&#39;t recall, bummer that it is, what time it was when we arrived. We were last at a funeral reception and the last time I&#39;d checked the time, it was 10:38. We might not have left until 11 PM, and it could well have taken 45 minutes to get way back where we were, so I don&#39;t think there was any missing time. However, after I got back in the van and we waited a few minutes to see if anything else would show, we started to drive out and saw a flash of white light. There were no other vehicles around; perhaps it was a ranger with a flashlight? I don&#39;t know. We just left! &lt;G&gt;<n>

My wife and I ignored them at first, thinking they were seeing a contrail from a jet.  But taking a second look we began noticing unusual characteristics about the object that separated it from the hundreds of vapor trails we&#39;d seen from aircraft.  First, the object appeared to be moving very rapidly compared to conventional aircraft.  Second, the head of the object was indeed a distinct fireball shape with no clear separation between the object itself and the vapor trail as you expect in a jet.  Third the jet is rarely perceived at all or - if it is the object is smaller than the vapor trail itself especially in width - that is one usually perceives the contrail but no jet.  Fourth, the contrail was not in a straight vector as it trailed from the object, but was more whispy and appeared carried by the winds or the atmosphere.  Fifth, the contrail varied in size - both in length and width - as the object traveled. In fact, soon afterwards we observed a jet contrail and noted the distinct differences between it and what we just saw. For a brief moment we saw another object like the first.  The parties and myself are in a disagreement over whether this was the original object we saw at a greater distance, another object, or a jet. My personal opinion is that the object was either a very large piece of space debris, a crashing aircraft, a huge meteor, or an extraterrestrial craft.<n>

Upon descent, near San Jose, California, at an approximate altitude of 5-8,000ft., we witnessed a bright, metallic spherical object travelling south in the opposite direction of our airliner, approx. 7 o&#39;clock low seen from the port side of our aircraft. Speed is hard to guess, we saw it for only about 2 seconds, just enough for our brains to realize there WERE NO WINGS. I would guess our airliner to be travelling at 2-300 mph, the sphere probably 3-400mph in the opposite direction. I wished I had stayed to ask the pilot if he had seen it, I was almost afraid to. Now I see why these things are never reported to the media, who would listen? (and I AM the media!)<n>

More acute than equilateral in shape. 2 strobes toward the back; rapidly flashing in perfect tandem.  Also red and blue-white lights around edges with &#34;tail lights&#34; in back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from my part-time weekend job at about 12:20 am on 4-24-00.  I noticed to the south what appeared to be an airliner flying with a pronounced yaw from the south to the northwest.  What struck me was the speed, the yaw, the light patterns, and the altitude for the size of the object.  As I got closer I noticed that the &#34;plane&#34; wasn&#39;t progressing past me toward Hartsfield Airport to the North.  Finally I drove right beside/underneath it, and found it to be in a dead hover or maybe a very slow drift.  It appeared to be ~1/4 mi directly to the west, at an altitude of ~1000 to 2000 ft. At that point I really perked up.  This thing was the size of a jumbo jet &#34;parked&#34; silently over high voltage power lines just north of a trailer park.  As I looked closer, I could make out the shape of a black triangle that was more acute or narrow than an equilateral triangle.  Also the lights were not conventional.  To the best of my recollection there were red and bluish-white lights around the edges and what appeared to be red &#34;tail lights&#34;. One feature that I remember without question is that their were two strobe lights positioned toward the rear, but not in the corners of the triangle.  They strobed rapidly, in short flurries, and in perfect tandem.  As I was traveling south and the object was traveling north, I pulled off at the next exit and got out of my car to look.  I had traveled away from object at 70mph for a full 60 seconds and it was still roughly in the same position and only appeared slightly smaller in it&#39;s angular view.  A jet would have moved on much farther north. I have never seen something so &#34;out of place&#34; and unusual in the sky in my life.  I am a 34 yr. old college grad; married, father of two.  I have a spotless reputation in my community.  I am dying to know if anyone else saw this thing.  There were cars on the interstate and people in the trailer park that this thing drifted over.  My mind is still trying to come to grips with what my eyes witnessed.  I should also mention that I have lived in the flight corridor for Hartsfield all of my life and conventional aircraft don&#39;t even register in my mind as noteworthy.  I am an amateur astronomer and am well aquainted with celestial bodies and atmospheric phenomena.  This was neither.  I&#39;m at a loss as to what this was.  Feel free to contact me with questions.<n>

In the lower areas of the largest, pulsing, towered cloud,  I watched a craft in the southern sky for approximately 2 minutes. Whatever it was, it glowed and looked like 2 roundish globes separated from eachother by a line, one globe sort of soft purple color and the other, a soft yellow but the light from it didn&#39;t seem to shine. It was approximately 2 miles away. It slid through the air sometimes fast and sometimes very slow, occasionally begoming fixed. It seemed to blink away a few times; as though it were peeking out from something. It disappeared into the mass of the storm and I went inside, disturbed because I don&#39;t really believe in this ((deleted))... but I saw something and it was different. A little later I went back out and watched the electrical storm flash, but there was little to the thunder, sometimes no report seemed to follow the flashes. I saw in the north sky, again at the bottom of the massive cloud the orb thing. Like the other, it went into and was obscured by the storm. There were also at least 4 enormous, deep turquoise flashes that lit the sky up green for extended periods of time coming from the center of the darkest area of the storm. Very little rain fell.<n>
4/23/00 21:30|Scarborough (Toronto) (Canada)|ON|Disk|10 seconds|I was looking west watching a commercial jet fly overhead and noticed three disc shaped objects that formed a triangle move quickly and|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12704.html|58|ndxe200004| I was looking west watching a commercial jet fly overhead and noticed three disc shaped objects that formed a triangle move quickly and silently north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On April 23rd at approximately 9:30pm I was leaving My parents home after dinner and was walking out to my car. I noticed how clear the sky was as it had been cloudy, cool and rainy for quite a few days prior. Astronomy is a hobby of mine and I was facing west adimiring some of the stars when I noticed a plane approaching from the direction of Pearson International Airport. It wasn&#39;t to high up, probably a few thousand feet and I could see the wings, tail and fuslage as it flew over head. Just as it passed over I noticed three disc shaped objects that formed a triangle moving north and seemed to be lower than the plane. I could not see anything in between the discs such as a body or wings, and I began to wonder if they were in fact three separate objects moving together. They were not very bright and did not have any flashing lights nor did the brightness fluctuate but the discs themselves were well defined and not at all fuzzy or blurry. I called to my father who was at the top of the driveway but by the time he came down they had moved over the house and were getting lost in the light of a large mall directly north were they went out of site. The object/objects were larger against the sky than the plane and seemed to be lower in altitude. They made no noise whatsoever, they were silent, and moved quickly in a straight line north with no noticeable change in altitude. The siteing lasted about 10 seconds. I do not believe it was an aircraft as I could not see anything other than the discs and I could make out all of the jetliner that passed by. They did not make any sound, and it most certainly would have, had it been a plane. It was moving quite fast and must have been fairly low. If it was in fact much higher, than the speed was allot quicker than I origianally thought and the object would have been huge. The object/objects were about the size of the nail on your small finger held at arms length and about 1/2 inch apart at arms length. I am 36 years old, married and have been an ameture astronomer for 2-3 years now. I have witnessed many differtent events and objects and am more conscious of what goes on in the sky than most. This was nothing like anything I had ever seen before.<n>

4/23/00 18:40|Nevada (On west bound airplane over northern)|NV|Disk|12 seconds|Round silver object as seen from above with rounded top as a shadow was cast.|5/3/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12776.html|60|ndxe200004| Round silver object as seen from above with rounded top as a shadow was cast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While traveling on United flight 739 from Denver to San Jose, in a window seat, I saw a round silvery object with a &#34;hump&#34; or rounded top pass below the plane in the opposite direction from West to East.  The rounded top was identifiable by a shadow that was cast by the low setting sun at 1840 PDT.  Assuming we were at about 30,000 feet, the craft was at about 25,000 feet as it looked about a mile away, at the 7 o&#39;clock position in reference to the planes forward motion, i.e. pilots 7 o&#39;clock position.  That means I saw it along the bottom of my window, as well as the window in front and in back of the one next to me.  I first caught a glimpse in the window in front of me, across the window next to me, and followed it through the window behind me until it disappeared underneath the wing.  I was in row 10 on the left side of the plane, so I was looking down and to the South.  It took about 10-12 seconds to cover that span of sight.  Ten minutes later I saw another jet liner about 3 miles away, also going from West to East and it took about 40 seconds to cross my view in just the window next to me - hence the UFO was traveling at about 5 times faster than that airliner. I believe we were over northern Nevada at the time, just after clearing a very rugged mountain range.  I estimate the object to be 50-60 feet in diameter based on the width of the occasional dirt road I could see on the desert floor.  It was a very desolate area. I tried to seek out the pilot and crew after the flight, by waiting for them about 20 minutes to deplane, but they didn&#39;t get off, so I went about my business.  Some research of who piloted that flight aught to identify the crew, and they may be willing to confirm the sighting.  I didn&#39;t say anything to anyone on the plane about what I just saw.<n>

We have proposed this possibility to the witness, and are awaiting a response.  This type of advertising light, somewhat new in the U. S. market, may be new to the Asian market.  It has caused many reports from the U. S., as well.))<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4 oval white lights circulating in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see how it began. My wife alerted me and others to see some moving lights in the sky while all of us were at my house balcony. 4 oval lights were seen circulating in a constant circle, each of the light would travel a quarter of the circle and all the 4 of them would merge together with one another (overlapping) at the center of the circle (circular path). It was just a moment after they merge that they dispersed and circulated again. They took about 2 seconds to complete one  cycle. I took serveral photos of the sighting using a normal camera, but i am not sure whether the lights could be seen upon development of the film. The lights were oval in shape and white in colour. It seemed like someone have used a very powerful spotlight to shine it into the sky, but there was no beam/spectrum from the source of the light. The sky and the moon was covered with some clouds. The lights were not flying in the clear sky. They seemed to be flying among the cloud. It was about 15 minutes later where they disappeared. All the 4 lights have merged together before flying away from  us. Their flying away was fater than the speed of lighting. In the midst of our observation, i have noticed a plane flying past the phenomenon. I will email the images upon development of them.<n>

Our friend was parked in the Excalibur Parking lot across from the Luxor. We were standing and talking when I noticed a pyramid like shape of six lights above the hotel. I first believed it to be some sort of Jet, But there was no sound and also no FDA regulated strobbing lights. Then the lights changed its configuration from a large pyramid of six lights into two small pyramids of three lights each. I gasped and called attention to the lights. All of us looking then watched it go back into a large pyramid. It changed again into a almost figure 8 symbol, then back into a large pyramid before disappearing quickly into the horizon.(Towards the directiion of the Tropicana) Like I said there was no strobbing lights, and they seemed to be small individual lights. The configurations happened so quickly I didn&#39;t see them move. It was as if It went from one to the other faster than the eye. The lights were a yellowish-gold to green color and they were dim. Not bright. Im curious to know if anyone else saw anything on this night. If so please contact me.<n>

It was in Oak Leather Community Center in Burke Virginia. When we were eating dinner one of my friends saw something so me and my other friend looked up.It was some kind of shape. The light around it were colorful and bright also it was the border of the saucer. The lights were so bright I could see the disk (not the shape the disk but the the real disk). I have done research on U.F.O&#39;s and this one went very slow. it was also low flying or it must have been HUGE. Also the U.F.O was kinda of tilted to the left. P.S. I thing if we can make a fake magneticfield the let the spacecraft fall into it we could go maybe about the same speed of UFO&#39;s.<n>

At first we both assumed that it was military craft but after observing them it was obvious that it wassent due to the fact that they were traveling much slower than a airplane and they made no noise at all and the lighting on the craft were not consistant with those of a normal aircraft...all three vessels had dim blue lighting on them in a triangle pattern, while observing them they flew out of view within 10 minutes of seeing them they were heading north.<n>

It was mostly overcast, but I could see some stars. As I was looking at the Big Dipper constellation, I noticed a light streaking overhead. This object was bright enough to shine through the cloud cover. In less then 10 seconds the object flew over my head to about 45 degrees in the east, then performed a perferct right angle turn to the south. This object was a round fireball, bright red in color. The speed of this thing was incredible, making me believe it was a meteor. I would still believe this if I had not seen the right angle turn. I am a 31 year old factory worker.<n>

I had just gone onto my back porch when I saw the object. I Thought at first it was a plane coming in for landing, as it was flashing blue and red, white lights. It never moved, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired RN, and my son, who also saw the object, is a Respiratory Therapist. He was getting ready to go to work, and usually leaves 22:30 hrs. I called him out to see the object, and he became very excited when he saw it was pulsating lights, but not moving. We went outside with binoculars, but the binoculars did not help, only confirmed it was not moving.It appeared to be very high up, at the level a commercial airplane flies. I called my sister, who lives about 1/4 miles from me. She verified the same sight. She is a teachers assistant at a local school. None of us has ever seen a UFO, and we were trying to be objective, like it might be a star, or whatever, but it was too bright and pulsating to be a star, and it wasn&#39;t moving. Has anyone else reported seeing this object?<n>

It was below cloud level (broken clouds) which was about 12.000 ft. I decided this was not an aircraft of any kind I recognized and began to move to the shoulder of the highway so I could get a camera and field glasses.  As I was looking at it, it simply vanished. It did not go behind a cloud, it did not visibly speed up and move off.  It just vanished as I was watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness who submitted report indicates he is a member of &#34;MUFON,&#34; the Mutual UFO Network.

I stopped to look at it. It was about 25 to 40 feet long &amp; had lot&#39;s of white lights, at least three big white lights &amp; many fainter white lights &amp; one faint flashing red light.  At least three of the white lights where flashing. It made no noise.  It was traveling about 40- 50 mph, &amp; traveling from the northwest to the southwest.  It took about 5 min. for it to cross the sky.  I looked at it through my bynoculars &amp; took hi-8 camcorder film of it.  it was about 150 to 250 feet off the ground &amp; 1/4 to 1/2 mile awy from me.  I took about one min. or so of footage. The footage is in three segments, due to an object getting in the way, &amp; may shaking &amp; needing to move in order to prop my arms on the side rail of my truck to steady the camcorder.  No contact or missing time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling home from work on highway 101 out off Ranta Rosa, when I saw a bright light on the horizon to the northwest.  I desided to pill off the road tpo get a better look at it, as it seemed to be coming towards my position.  I Exeited the freeway at Central Healsburg Ave. &amp; drove out of town &amp; found a dark clear or open place to stop.  I at first stayed in my truck &amp; uust rolled down my window &amp; looked at the lights through my bynoculars, I at that time determined that it was light no other air craft I&#39;ve ever seen so I grabed my hi-8 camcorder &amp; begain filming.  it too a bit for the camcorder to focus on it.( it was swt on auto focus) after getting in focus I zoomed in on it useing the lens zoom only.  it&#39;s been my experience that when I use the digital zoom the quality goes down grately, so I don&#39;t usually use it.  Then I lost it behind a object so I got out of the truck with the film still running &amp; got it in sight once again, but I was shaking to badly to get a steady shot so I again move to the side of my truck to prop my arms on the side rail.  I got a few more seconds of footage before I was distracted by the other lights that where in the sky.  I think that most if not all of the other lights where commercail aircraft.  I tried taking footage of them but didn&#39;t do to well, they where further away.  This area is really close to where I saw another light in the sky back in Sept. or Oct. 99, in Windser.  It&#39;s as the crow flies about 1 to 1 1/2 miles away.  The triangle was traveling with the point in the front or pointed in the direction it was going.  it never turned up or down, left or right, yaw &amp; roll, or speed.  I could only see the faint/small lights when it was at it&#39;s closest.  I could not make out a body or outline off the craft.<n>

I ran into the house and woke up my 13 year old son to make sure that he witnessed it. It was completely stationary, yet the lights were glistening at a terrific pace. It made no noise. I went inside to get my cell phone to call the police, and when I came back outside, it was gone.

The next thing i knew I was face up on some hard surface there was a bright light so I couldn&#39;t see much. There where dark figures above me and they kept making weird sounds. I felt things touching me. They where light and kind of tickled. The next moring I woke up and i had a scare across my inner arm that had not been there befor. A couple of years later I was at the beach with friends and thier metal detector kept going off around my arm. Every now and then I still have head aches that similar to the ones I had that night.

Each group took approx. 3 sec. flying at 80 to 90 degrees across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching from a parking lot, we observed small lights in a semi-circle which we first thought were geese.  Of course, it was too dark for geese and this formation moved across the sky in about 3 seconds.  We continued on to my car and another group of 7 appeared in the sky about 15 sec. later. We stopped this time wondering if it was the same group having returned but another appeared after the same 15 second interval with 3 which invalidated that premise.  My friend commented that the skies were alive tonite as we turned back to the South and awaited another group.  Much to our surprise, a group of 14 flew over.  These were not in a perfect semi-circle formation and were more scattered. By this time we had ruled out a search light and airplanes which were flying slowly by comparison in the area.  After another group of seven which flew directly overhead, the show was over. There were not sounds whatsoever, and it was smooth sailing from one end of the sky to the next.  Very spectacular -- incredible!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We received a telephoned report from both parties who witnessed this event.

We both said &#34;Wow look at those geese.&#34; then we both knew that it wasn&#39;t geese because the sky was black and these were lit up.  They wandered in formation from south east to north west across the sky in an arch.  We said &#34;Those were not geese.... that was a UFO.&#34;  We stood and looked at each other amazed and a little in shock.  Then about 45 seconds to a minute later another group flew over. The first group had 7 in it and so did the second group.  We both yelled there goes another group.  We couldn&#39;t believe it.  It took about 5 seconds for them to go from horizon to horizon.  There were airplanes flying around at the time to compare with and these were deffinatly not air planes.  My friend thought maybe a search light but there was no way that these tinkerbell lights could be a search light because of their shape and brightness and they were traveling in a straight line.  We thought maybe they were circling around and around but then while we were talking a group of 3 flew overhead. This group was not as organized as the others were.  They looked as if they were trying to catch up and were bouncing around more than the others were.  By now we were looking in the direction they were comming from waiting for the next group to come.  Our mouths hanging open.  Soon a group of 14 flew over in chevron pattern 7 on one side and 7 on the other side.  I could tell they were not attached lights because they floated around in the formation.  All groups were traveling at about the same speed.  The group of 3 going the slowest.  We were yelling and bouncing up and down as we turned and watched them  until they were out of sight.  We were both covered in goose bumps and starting to shake.  Then the next group of 7 flew directly over us. That was the closest group.  There was not a sound from any of them. We waited for several minutes but no more appeared.  The entire sighting was about 3 to 5 minut! es long.<n>

It was a slow process, and I didnt notice it at first as i was thinking of other things.  It reached the intesity of a bright moonlight night in a area about the 1 acre in size.  I noticed a bright light over head the intensity of a landing light on a plan at about 1 mile. When i looked up the light started to fade as if on a reastat.  There was absolutly no sound, and it was very still, and I am used to looking and hearing all forms of aircraft. There is nothing that could produce the intesity of light and not be heard.<n>

I decided to investigate and travelled East off Plank Rd.  As I approached the objects appeared to hover and rome the countryside. By the time I arrived at the location of these objects the sun had set, and the objected appeared as orbs of light.  I parked my car and I got out to observe these lights.  There was no noise emitted from these orbs.  Then I saw a triangle approaching from the Southeast.  It was an equalateral trianle, and I estimated the legs to be 100 to 150 ft across.  It was densely metallic and black in coloration.  There were lights in each of the three corners of the triangle.  The object came extremely close, and then it stopped completely in mid air.  Then I stood in disbelief as it emitted an orb of light.  It seemed to materialize out of thin air!  So, the source of the mysterious lights I had seen previous to the triangle had been emitted by the triangle itself.  The orb then floated soundlessly over my car and drifted over the cornfields.  The black triangle then floated away until it disappeared over the horizon.<n>

Looking north through a ide space between two palm trees, I saw what I believed to be an airplane {what else would it have been?} and I was immediately intrigued because there was so much light coming from within.  It didn&#39;t have the shape of a plane, just oblong with huge lights.  I took four or five steps looking down to re-<n> <n><n> treive the newspaper and then immediately looked for what I had first believed to be an airliner approching for a landing at Palm Springs in the west.  The craft was no longer anywhere in the sky.  Nowhere!  Then was when I was just plain shocked...I had never believed in sightings of<n> <n><n> unexplained objects...this I KNEW IMMEDIATELY was something very strange, unaccountable to me in any manner, for the object which was moving so slowly from my left toward the east was nowhere in the sky within a matter of perhaps six-seven seconds, the amount of time to move toward and pick up the paper.  Since I had been initially quite aware of so much light and had never before seen such a thing, I wanted to follow it&#39;s curve and appoach to the west.  It was my first thought that I had, indeed, seen something unexplainable.  Bear in mind that I have recently moved here from Bellevue, Wa. and saw approaching and departing aircraft for over 30 years and have NEVER seen anything flying so low, slow and so much light looking as though the windows were huge.  Since it was so low in the sky there was no sun up far enough to have been a long reflection, even as it moved slowly easternly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 64 yrs old, female, very pragmatic, extremely well educated and read, recently retired from being a stock broker and certified financial planner.

Month and approx. Date I observed 3 to 4 round lights approx. 3 to 4 feet in diameter suspended over a group of trees as I was driving my Land Rover. I was leaving for the Capitol city (Dilli) and it was darkness to dawn (just starting to get light). As I drove over the town&#39;s winding,dirt roads I observed the lights over trees approx. 75meters from me. At the time I thought it peculiar because the whole town had no electricity due to the civil war. The only electricity in the town was at Civ Pol headquarters and with the Military at their headquarters outside town. I attempted to follow it, however it moved silently away.I moved toward it as fast as I could but it vanished from my view approx. 200meters from the point I first observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report appears to have been submitted from a military e-address.

I am from Secunderabad, India, though I am currently working in Singapore. I went to india on a vacation when my sighting took place. It happend on 19th april, 10:20 pm when me and a friend of mine were hanging out on his terrace. we were just gazing at the stars when suddenly we noticed two objects (disc shaped) with amazing tails fly from south-westernly direction to north-eastern direction. The tails were really really beautiful, unlike any I saw, on comets and stuff. the tail was glowing, light bluish in colour and atlest 8-9 times the size of the object (quite big..in comparision to the objects). they moved pretty fast and in a very parallel route when the second object broke into 3 more (so there were 5 objects now. the original two plus 3 tailing the second object). We were completly mesmerized to do anything...my camera was in my bike below but I just couldn&#39;t take my eyes of those objects. after some time the four objects joined back and now there were only two moving along parallely. they moved in the north-eastern direction for about couple of minutes when they...just vanished. The local daily contacted the local observatory who gave a bull-shit report that it could have been weather balloon. No way man, weather ballons don&#39;t have tails. Neither can they move at such speed. and too parallel. It couldn&#39;t have been comets cos comets dont break up and join back. it would have been in the news if comets were approaching anyway. They were kinda disc shaped..The sightings have been reported from another part of the country too. Local dailies said that few people in Bihar, India had seen the two objects but am not sure if they saw the same incident.<n>

Object at first appeared to be very bright misplaced planet or star (more like a planet), then started moving! I guestimate altitude at about 50,000 + feet, rapidly headed upward with slight South-South-Easterly direction. As it continued up, light became dimmer rapidly, almost as though there was a spotlight pointed down at me and it was slowly rotated towards the horizon as it travelled up. No sounds were audible. We live in the flight path of planes leaving LAX, this was NOT a regular flight plan, or holding pattern around the airport. The altitude was VERY high. This did not appear to be anything I&#39;ve seen from Edwards AFB (close by). There was no visible exhaust trail of any kind. The sky was clear and without clouds and only slightly hazy (it had just rained within the last day). After exclaiming this to my girlfriend, she says she saw two similar objects approximately two weeks earlier, but didn&#39;t mention it at the time, therefore we have no date or time to report, other than it was in the early evening, after dark. She saw two separate objects a minute or two apart, both travelled in the same direction. She witnessed no dimming of the light, but the objects travelled a short distance before disappearing. She describes them as looking like moving stars that just disappeared from the sky. Not sure if these were even UFOs, but would like some possible explanation.<n>

4/19/00 13:30|Arroyo Seco|CA|Light|5-10 min|Blue glowing cloud shape.|5/3/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12721.html|93|ndxe200004| Blue glowing cloud shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went camping/biking at Arroy Seco last week with three other friends. the plan was to bike the Indians Road to the top of the mountain and turn back before it began it&#39;s descent to Big Sur. My friends were pretty much too out of shape to make the 14 mile ride so I went alone while they stayed at the gorge, roughly three miles from the camp site. I began the ride well before noon to avoid direct sunlight since the trail is on the west side of mountain. Initially, I was at this same mountain last summer, when i only completed about 7 miles of the trail. I was determined to make it to the top since then. About 9 miles up the mountain, I paused for a short break at the 9 mile marker. There is a sign there outlining the trails you can access from there and thier distances. While I was resting and eating, I noticed a small &#39;rainbow&#39; in the sky near a cluster of common clouds. The &#39;rainbow&#39; had an unusual shape. More like that of the Aurora Borealis (did I spell that right?) then a conventional rainbow. It appeared to be eminating from the cluster of clouds in a sheet-like pattern. I really didn&#39;t pay a great deal of attention to it since the colors were familiar to that of a regular rainbow. Other then the fact that it was extremely pretty, it really didn&#39;t strike me as odd. However, when I got back on my bike and rode for maybe another mile or two, I came around a blind curve all the while glancing up at the rainbow. When I came around though, I noticed an additional cloud that was out of view before. This cloud had a strange shape in the sense that it was not like the other clouds around. It was more like a heavy mist below the rest of the clouds. The strangest thing about this cloud though was it&#39;s color: the top half of the cloud was normal white/grey, but the bottom half was a neon blue! No kiddin! I have never seen such a color that was not man made, i.e., it had the color of a those glow sticks you would see at a dance or perhaps on Halloween. It seemed to just hang above the mountain I was riding. Being so high in the mountains has a somewhat breathtaking feeling by itself, add a sight that you have never before seen, and you can become downright freaked-out. I stopped riding and just watched the cloud and it&#39;s unusual color. I thought I would continue my ride and hope to &#39;get a closer look&#39; at the &#39;object&#39;. I began riding again for another mile or so when the trail began a descent for about a quarter mile in a very curvey fashion. The road ended at this point due to a landslide that had occured, perhaps this last winter. I climbed the slide and realized that it was surely unstable. Should I fall, I would have been screwed. I looked up to see if I could still see the &#39;cloud&#39; but could not. I assumed that because of my position, my vision was impaired. Note: when i first saw the cloud, it was in the S/SE sky. At the current postion I was in, I was facing SW and because I still had a ways to go to reach the top of the mountain, it is possible that the cloud was much lower to the mountain top then I had once though. At this point, rather then hiking my bike over the land slide, I decided to turn around head back to camp. The rest of the trail would all be down hill. I stopped at the same point in the trail that I first saw the cloud to see if it was still there...of course, it wasn&#39;t. Witness note: I have always been fascinated with space/science, etc and have never been one to accept things without a logical explaination. Yet, there is certainly a part of me that wants to believe in such things as intelligent beings from other worlds, spirits, ghosts, god, etc. But until now, I usually have an explaination for things that most people would rather just excuse as &#39;miracles&#39; &#39;un-explained phenomona&#39; &#39;UFO sightings&#39;, etc. I have begun a search for such Meteorological anomolies(?) but have turned up empty handed. A friend told me that there is a talk show host that believes that the government is conducting experiments to control the weather patterns. I surely cannot give that much credit to our government. I think that there is a logical explanation for what I saw, I just have yet to find it. If anyone has any info on such &#39;lights in the clouds&#39; please post them on this site or contact me via e-mail. Thanks for &#39;listening&#39;.<n>

I was in the center of three seats, so I could not actually see well out the window when I snapped the shot.  I just held my camera out to the window and took the picture.  At the time I noticed nothing unusual.  It was a clear, sunny day, and we were flying above the clouds.  Upon developing my film, I noticed a small brownish triangular spot in the distance.  The wing is also present.  I have maintained that this is probably debris on the aircraft window, but persons I have shown it to have been inclined to think that it is something else, often describing it as similar to a stealth bomber.  Since I did not observe whatever it was, whether something stuck to the window or else, I cannot offer any further details.  And although I myself am skeptical, I figured there would be no harm in submitting the photo to persons better qualified to analyze it.  I also have the original negatives, but would be reluctant to submit these since I have excellent vacation photos on the roll.  If you would like me to send the photo to you, please let me know.<n>

We were moving at about 70 mph-probably 20 miles north of Cocoa Beach, FL exit ramps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden the top section of my 19XX ((deleted--vehicle)) windshield was filled by the shape of a rough cylinder object about 75-100 feet over the highway crossing over the highway at a 90 degree angle to it and from my right to my left (headed east).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was gigantic--being at least two hundred feet long and maybe 60-75  high.  Along the top of the object were a line of blue lights - maybe five or six and along the bottom maybe 8-10 white lights and another 10 along the side-somewhat like halogen lights and constant - no strobe or on or off.  I am positive about these colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to rather  &#34;float&#34; across the road at 100-150 mph. There was NO noise nor sounds at all. The most significant feature was a row of about 8-10 rectangular giant white panels along the side with a big  X in each one and some object in the center -like a small dome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The panels were lit with a white light from within. These were giant and not any type of conventional aircraft windows since they were far larger. They had a slight bend to their line or position down the side of the craft-up in the front and back. There may or may not have been a wing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just a second to hit my dosing son and yell...&#34;look at that&#34;.  He did  see it also for a split second.  It was so close and so sudden that I almost lost control of my vehicle but was able to put my window down and steal one 1.5 to 2 second glance to my left.  I could see it from the rear (by this time 3-400 yards away and still hugging the ground - at best 100 feet up) and headed east).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reminded me of a giant vulcan bomber but I cannot be sure. Not sure I saw any vertical stabilizer.  It was emmense and with the window down-- still no sound was audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen and touched B-52, C5A, B-1, Sr-71 BLACKKBIRD, WARTHOGS,AND PHANTOM AIRCRAFT AND ALSO SEEN JUST ABOUT EVERY OPERATIONAL COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY conventional aircraft in the US--it was NONE of these being far far larger and totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Color - unkown maybe I cannot recall as it was so sudden.  From the rear I have a faint recollection of a giant thick maybe wing like shape-maybe delta or - but it may not have been a wing.  This had to be 4-5 times the size of a B52. It was not a B-2. The rectanges were at least 10-20 feet high and about 8-15 feet across. They were along the side rather like the guns of an old ship of the line. They were not like any window of any aircraft I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Impression was of -maybe- again maybe-a gigantic man made aircraft flying in a very dangerous manner without conventional running lights,no sound and at way under the stall speed for any aircraft of that size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have searched the internet for years looking for similar observations and found only a distant few.  No alcohol or drugs used by me - I have never seen any other &#34;UFO&#34; but found the time today to enter what I can recall here for others.  My son recalls the rectangular white objects along the side and the blue and white lights-he recalls more white lights than I do -- maybe 15-20 along the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Patrick AFB was a number of miles to the southeast but the object was far lower than any conventional flight or landing path- had no landing lights or wheels down.<n>

Arizona time, I was outside looking west, watching an airplane flying west when I noticed a bright flash about 30 degrees above the horizon almost due west. The object had an elongated shape like a rocket and was pointing and moving upwards. It looked to be about one third the length of a straight pin held at arms length. I followed the object upwards for about 10 to 15 seconds to an angle of about 45 degrees. The object started to emit a vapor trail for about one second and then the whole thing disappeared from sight. I hope it was a launch from Vandenburg AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A test launch was announced for this date, although the time indicated by the witness is apparoximately 1 hour later than the original launch &#34;window.&#34;   As indicated below, the launch was scheduled to take place up to 16:59 hrs.

See full description<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1132 PDT on 3/18/00 while flying a cessna C206 at 5,500&#39; on a heading of 155 magnetic, approximately between Bremerton and Tacoma, WA airport, we sighted an extremely bight light with an intensity approaching that of the sun at about our 12:30 to 1:00 position. The haze layer top was about 4,000&#39; and this light appeared to be below the haze layer top.  It was judged to be south of Fort Lewis Army base but north of the hills south of Fort Lewis.  Sky conditons were clear and unlimited visibility above the haze layer.  We initially thought it to be light reflected from a metal roof but the light stayed in the same relative position making that unlikely.  I held my thumb to the light and was able to block it out but the size of the light must have been very large as I judged it to be many miles away.  After a couple of minutes another light appeared over and separated from the large round light.  This was a more flat or crescent shape, roughly the same diameter as the round light.  I attempted to call Tacoma Tower to ask if they had it in sight but they did not answer.  Due to airspace restrictions I had to descend to pass over the southern tip of Vashon Island.  In the descent, at about 4,500&#39; the light suddenly disappeared. I have been a pilot for 47 years, military and civilian with over 20,000 flying hours.  I have not seen a similar event during that time and judge this to be out of the limits of anything I have noted during those flying hours. I did not have a camera with me so have no photos. The intensity would be similar to White Phosphorus burning but in this sighting, no sign of drifting or descending as a white Phosphorus shell or flare  would exhibit so I ruled that out.  The intensity was near that of the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date to 18AP00.  We have made correction here.  PD))<n>

About one-fourth of the night sky was illuminated with a series of rapid, strobe-like pulses of greenish light above the cloud cover.  Definitely greenish, not blue-white like lightning or sheet lightning.  No thunderclap or any aircraft sounds.  The light source moved from south to north along a line paralleling Interstate 5, east of Corvallis.  Thick, broken clouds prevented any direct view, but the multiple green flashes were distinctly brighter than the moon which was south and east at the time of the sighting.  Estimate base of broken cloud cover at approx. 6,000 feet.  Winds W-SW variable at 10-20 mph. This sighting was similar to the February fireball in terms of the definite greenish cast and the fact that it suddenly flashed into view, i.e. the immediate, lightning-bright flash above the cloud layer, and that tonight&#39;s whatever it was traveled what seems to have been the same south-to-north trajectory.  At least three or four distinct, bright green flashes against a bright green glow that covered at least 25 percent of the sky for about 10 seconds.<n>

I watched this thing for approximately ten minutes, while on hwy 4 east, between Pittsburg and Antioch. After driving into my driveway, I observed the object change direction to the north. At this time I ran inside the house and called my wife outside. My wife and I watched the object for another three to five minutes. The object moved slowly toward the San Juaquin river and began dropping smaller &#34;sparks&#34; over the river.

I wanted to go outside and see clearer, but I was frightened to do so.  Then one of the cylinders sped away and only one remained for approximately 2-3 hours---I didn&#39;t stay at the window watching constantly but I kept going back and forth to my window to see if it, or they were still there moving around the sky--and yes, one of them was.  I finally went to bed at 22:00PM.  There was much motion of lights inside my home, so I figured they were still out there.  This is not my first sighting.  I have had several.  Last night was a full moon and the sky was very blue and clear.  Once, last July, there was a silver cylinder that stayed motionless for about one hour, it was only 17:00PM and broad daylight; it finally made a l80 degree turn and left very fast to become a small dot then totally disappeared.  There were 6 witnesses.  That nite the news said it was a weather baloon, but it was not--no weather baloon could possibly take off at speeds of light!<n>

It was about 19:20, bright and sunny day, when we both noticed a very, very bright meteor like object traveling at a very high rate of speed towards the SE. We had a compass with us and took a bearing. We first saw the object  at around 155 and last saw it at 135.  I believe the object was 40-50 degrees above the horizon when we first saw it and about 20 when it disappeared behind a ridge. It may have actually sort of went, &#34;poof&#34;, right before it went behind the ridge. It changed color also as it traveled, I saw white, white-blue, green, orange. The event lasted about 2.5 seconds. It was extremely bright and comparable to the light created by a welder. It was actually very beautiful. About 3 to five minutes after witnessing the object, we heard a very low boom-like crack coming from the SE. It was definitly not gunfire or blasting. It upset many birds in the area. We witnessed about 25-30 ravens flying SE afterwards which seemed out of character, because the usually stay in pairs at lower elevations (from my experience).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Other reports submitted to the Snohomish County, Washington, 9-1-1 facility, and the Everett, WA, newspaper.  Apparently, the object may have been over the Cascade Mountains, or even east of there.))<n>

I was in an airplane above LAX, and we were flying above the clouds. The sun was shining brightly. I looked out the window and saw a lime green sphere in the sky. It resembled a tennis ball. I could not estimate the size of it; it was hard to tell if it was near or far. It passed the plane on the left side. The object was either hovering in one spot as the plane was passing it or it was moving past the plane in the opposite direction. I watched it pass from the front of the plane to the back.

At first glance I thought it was an early star then noticed the U-shape when I used the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on the causeway between Sanibel Island Florida and the mainland, facing the Gulf of Mexico, looking for shells and waiting for the sun to set.  The sun was about 1degree above the horizon when I noticed something to the right of the sun.  At first I thought it was an early star, but my husband said that it looked like a jet because there were two jet trails.  We both got our binoculars to get a closer look.  It did look like jet trails...but in the shape of a U and at the curved part of the U was a darkened area.  We could see it with the naked eye, but after the sun set we could only see it using binoculars.  We both watched until about 8:15 pm eastern time.  At that time...we just couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  Neither of us took our eyes off of this thing for even one second.  At arm&#39;s length, the U was about the size of going around the nail of a little finger fingernail.  The &#34;legs&#34; of the U were pointed slightly west...towards the sun.  An airplane passed in our field of view, at one point, and the brightness of the U-thing was much brighter than the trail left by the plane.  The plane was much closer to us.  Neither of us could make out any details of the darkened area inside the U.  It was just too far away.  From the horizon, the U-thing was about 30degrees up and only a few degrees North of due West.  Long/26 26N, Lat/82 1W...approximately where we were located.  There was never any movement.  We watched until it was just gone.  It disappeared before darkness rolled in.<n>

It was right across the street facing Southeast, right next to one of the buildings in the Naval Medical Center. The object was only about 100 feet in the air and made absolutely no movement. At about the same time some other people attending the festival began to take notice of the thing. One woman said it looked like a floating trash can. I started making my way towards the object and ran to the opposite sidewalk about 60 yards from where I was standing. The object still was in the original spot still and now I could plainly see that the bottom of the cylinder rotated in a counter-clockwise motion, and the top portion rotated clockwise. It was definitely made of a metallic material, and had a sort of box like protrusion on one side. I just sat there with my jaw gaping open and so did about 20-25 people around me. One Hispanic man was video taping it, while about 4 or 5 people were taking pictures. Then after about 30 minutes the object slowly moved around to the back of the building and was never seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was so bright I first thought it was a reflection of the sun from a banking airplane. the light continued to long to be an airplane so I looked closer. The light was continuing and varied in intensness over several magnitudes of brightness I noticed a smaller light blinking at about 7:00 o&#39;clock to the left of the main light, and another small light blinking at about 5:00 o&#39;clock to the right. I still thought it might be a conventional air craft until I noticed that both of the secondary lights were blinking at random rates independent of each other. I then noticed a second main light at about 35-40 degrees east of the first light and at similar apparent height. It displayed similar properties of fluctuating light intensity as the first. The second main light appeared to have a single smaller light directly below it slowly blinking on and of. I saw a parking lot just before the intersection of San Mateo and Montgomery and pulled into it to better observe the lights. When I got out of my car I noticed that the two lights seemed to have increased the space between them but were moving almost imperceptably slow. Then I saw a third bright light about 25-35 degrees south of the first light. It appeared to be closer than the first two and was extremely bright. I could make out no shapes but all of the light fluctuated in light intensity. At the brightest they looked as bright as the sun (perhaps as a star the size of our sun were to look if it were in a binary orbit less than a light year away) the lights were many thims brighter than venus or jupiter would be under the best nighttime viewing conditions. As I watched, all three light moved very slowly, The first light moving toward the south east, the second moving due east, and the third moving towards the south. At one point I noticed that the second light seemed to take on an elongated shape but it could have been glare on the windsheild of my car. As I watched, I heard the sound of a commercial jet comong from the south (were the airport is) and as it came into view, all three light started to fade out. By the time the jet came into view, all lights had disapeared. I waited for a couple of more minutes but they did not reappear. I saw no other motorists stop to look at the lights. The duration of the observation was +/- 4 minutes The lights were pure white in color. I study the UFO issue and have observed all sorts of aircraft both day and night in the skys of albuquerque including commercial and military aircraft. I have also seen brightly illuminated weather balloon in the upper atmosphere. These light were like nothing I have seen before.<n>

But then, as I came closer, &#34;the moon&#34; went back down behind the Red Rock it had risen from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attributed this to an optical illusion and turned onto Hwy. 179, which intersects the 89A at a nearly right angle.  As I drove on, I suddenly saw the REAL moon (which was a lot smaller) in front of me, on the opposite side of the sky from where I had seen it.  In other words, what I had seen was NOT the moon, but I have no idea what it was.<n>

We were having dinner at one of the restaurants near the PETRONAS twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur. It was a beautiful evening with clear skies and we sat outside at the waterfront.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Towards the end of the dinner I noticed three huge bright lights that appeared to be “hanging” between the towers slightly above the very top, positioned in a sort of triangular shape.  At first I thought it might be part of a marketing strategy, but since the three lights were stationed in the same spot the entire time I started to become curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up to get I closer look.  As I was walking around the waterfront I stopped people to ask them if they have seen those lights before. Most of the people I spoke to were from Kuala Lumpur and they all admitted that they’ve never seen such lights before between the towers.  Lots of people stopped and stood in awe of the lights.  We speculated what it could be and tried to determine if the lights could be a reflection coming from the towers. In the end we concluded that we were fortunate to see a UFO together, laughed and left it at that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 15 minutes after everything settled down again my friends and I decided to return to the hotel.  The lights were still there, hanging motionless in the sky. I could not take my eyes of the objects.  As we were walking towards the street to get into a taxi the lights started moving and it appeared to me that they were now following us.  My friend who remained very skeptical throughout the night now started getting very nervous and we got real anxious when the lights were still following us as we drove off in the taxi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while we lost sight of the lights as the other buildings obstructed our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I did not have a camera with me to capture any of this. I know that without a picture this siting is worth nothing. I am only reporting it in the hope that there is somebody out there that also spotted the lights and had a camera with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Having spent our first day exploring the vastness of the valley he suggested we go back to Beatty, eat and go to a private spot he found out about to avoid the tourist thing we both love to avoid.  I&#39;m speaking to him about family things from the past seeing as how it&#39;s been years since we were a unit.  When ((name deleted)) says to me ((name deleted)) I hate to interupt you but what the hell is that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the important thing you need to know is its desert,its windy,its cold, its ten in the evening. and there should be no one around just taking a walk in those conditions. So I look out the window of the truck we are trying to stay warm in and there is someone walking pointing a flashlight in our windshield,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I just lost my business and had been through five years of stress. So I got out of the truck and walked toward the light screaming you punks get the hell out of hear and leave us alone. While out there I realized this doesn&#39;t make sense The wind is howlin it&#39;s freezing cold there isn&#39;t a house for miles and we just got here. What the F#*&amp; is this. We decided the best course of action is to leave them alone. Well it looked just like flashlights. Right in our camp.They would be in front of us and as if on a cable move to our left about thirty yards away disappear and return right in front of us again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Against my brother&#39;s wishes I went to confront them again as they were to the position to our left far from the truck. At that point they looked like headlights the way they lined up. I hollered out. You punks got something to say,say it now! Then it accurred to me these lights were like ten feet off the ground and I couldn&#39;t see anything under them. Well as you can imagine I booked it up the hill looking behind me and these light just lowered right to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the condensed version of that evening.  My brother was so freaked about the experience he wanted to go to Big Pine California to camp the next evening. It took me hours to convince him what we saw was one of those lifetime experiences and needed to return. The next night was just unbelievable,but I need to know you are a believer before I continue I&#39;m tuckered out and will tell the rest if you are interested another time.<n>

Silently, coming right over the roof of my house this dark, almost black looking rectangle shaped object, resembling a chinese box kite about 15 feet across and maybe 4 feet thick, passed directly over my head.  It was hard to see if you didn&#39;t know it was there. It was very low just above the power lines and trees.  It made no sound what so ever.  I was trying to figure out what it was.  I had never seen anything like it.  When it was about 40 ft passed me, it turned down the street next to mine keeping one corner fixed then just turned the corner kind of the way a marching band makes a turn.  I watched it as it went away and then the weirdest thing happened.  I saw a very dark, deep, blood red, hard to see light seemed to glow from the back.  It appeared to change shape because the red glow went from being across the whole back to being like on the two ends of the top of a &#34;T&#34; or &#34;V&#34; and one being at about the base of a &#34;T&#34; or &#34;V&#34;.  I could not tell if it changed shape or split in three seperate things.  Weird.  It then went behind some tall trees and I never saw it or anything like it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have just read some reports online that were similar and it blew me away.  I have asked people for 5 years if they ever saw anything like it and they think I am nuts.  It was the same color as the night sky and was so close to my house.  I can&#39;t help but think it is some sort of spy plane.  It did not look like something from out of this world, just weird and like nothing I have ever encountered in my life.  I would love to see a photo or drawing of what others have seen and see if it is the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

They were on their way to my office and were only a couple of minutes from my front door when they spotted it. The object was about 1/8&#34; diameter at arms length and was clearly visible. The sky was absolutely clear with no smog or clouds. It was described to me by her son, who is 12 and a half years old as a saucer shaped object with a line at its girth separating the top half from the bottom. Interestingly, the top half was described as rotating on its axis while the bottom was stationary to the top. My girlfriend&#39;s son also described some purple and blue flashes that were being emitted from the surface of the object. He described these as flashes that would have the perspective as if you were looking into a tunnel. After viewing the video, these are clearly visible. Also, from his vantage point where he saw the object lower on the horizon, these would have been more in direct line with his line of sight and would have given him this tunnel perspective view. In contrast to this view, my video shows the object directly from its bottom. The object was hovering motionless for several seconds when two airplanes crossed ahead of it. These two airplanes were seen by both the mother who was driving and the son. Immediately after the planes crossed each other&#39;s paths, the object disappeared from view until the two planes were a fair distance away. It then re-appeared and began moving westward into the wind direction. Upon arriving at my office, they both frantically called out to me to get my video camera out, that there was a UFO. I immediately grabbed my camera and went out to take a look and hopefully get a shot. When I first viewed it, it was about 65 degrees off the horizon looking due east. I was in the parking lot of my office complex situated directly at the corner of Lomita Blvd. and Madison. I took my 5X telephoto lens with me to make sure that I got a good close up shot of it. It was climbing steeply and getting smaller very quickly as it moved westward. It was very hard to get a fix on it with my long lens. I simply couldn&#39;t find it fast enough, so I laid down on the pavement to steady the camera pressing my elbows against my ribcage. I found it and got about 4 seconds of video and quickly lost it again. In my video, it appears that the UFO is jumping around, but it was in fact moving very steadily. It continued west for about ten seconds, then took a fairly sharp turn to the north, crossways to the wind. It continued north with apparent slowing as it was climbing very fast until it was out of sight. I immediately took the video into my office where I have several computers and image processing programs. Upon looking at it, I not only got a very good shot of the object even though it was nothing more than a speck in the sky, but was able to get a few good frames of these purple and blue flashes that my girlfriend&#39;s son had described. When I looked at with my naked eye, I did not notice these probably because the object was so small. I took some of the frames and began doing some computer enhancements using only the hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, histogram, midtone enhancements and so on to bring out what detail that might be obtainable from the unchanged original video frame. I own an engineering company and have won several photography awards with the Kodak International Snapshot competition and PSA the Photographic Society of America.<n>

It looked like heat waves that come off a hot sidewalk.  The shape best described would be a haystack that was shifting shapes.

The object was floating over water and moving about 15 to 25 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over in a spot that gave us an unobstructed view of the ufo.

The weather that day was mostly sunny with clouds at about 3000 to 4000ft. I first noticed them flying about two miles south of Tacoma Narrows Airport runway 17.  Both of the saucer-shaped craft were flying together but looked as though they were engaged in a &#39;dog-fight&#39; because they seemed to be chasing each other and doing aerobatics while ascending and descending rather quickly.  I would estimate their speed at between 400 and 450 mph.  At that time there were no aircraft in their immediate vicinity. Throughout the duration of the sighting both objects seemed to stay in a very small area, perhaps no larger then a square mile.  As I watched the two objects, I knew from my experience in aviation that they were not any type of aircraft  I&#39;ve ever seen.  I can identify almost any military, commercial, or private aircraft that could be found flying in this country and what I saw was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen.  I should mention that at the time I was working at the airport fueling planes and for the last fifteen years years I&#39;ve been interested in aviation and I know what kind of flight characteristics a small plane or even a military or commercial jet can do.  And the way the way these objects were flying tells me that they weren&#39;t any conventional aircraft.  I should also mention that the objects made no sound.  And finally, I lost sight of the objects when they both flew into a large cloud which tells me they weren&#39;t any type of bird or remote-controlled airplane because of the height of the clouds and my viewing distance.  When they disappeared they were at least 3 miles away so I would estimate their size at between 50 and 75 feet in diameter.<n>

At first they appeared to be like sheets of paper rolling in the wind or a foil birthday balloon.  They were above the backdrop of South Mountain so it was hard to judge the size or distance.  They seemed to float like small white baloons.  I followed their path looking out the window while walking to the end of the terminal.  As they floated away to tiny white spots in the sky, one drifted away, but one stayed. I could judge position by seeing the roof of the terminal looking almost straight up. It held that position for 10 min. I went to get my camera and came back (30 sec.) to find it was gone. (I thought ok maybe just balloons.) I went to the next set of windows to keep searching looked up and there were 2 objects again, this time closer and lower in the horizon. They held that position for another 5 min with out moving.  (I thought cool a pair of ufos).  I watched for a while and looked away for maybe 30 seconds. I looked again and one was gone!  The other just floated off in the distance after another 5 minutes.. I snapped a couple of pictures but there is probably not a lot to see. Two aircraft at high altitude at different times crossed the field of view close to the objects. Nothing spectacular but worth noting.<n>

I had put our luggage out in the hall of the ship to be collected as we would be ending our trip the next morning. We departed Key West at 5:00pm and were sailing south going around the end of Florida heading for Fort Lauderdale. I was out on the deck listening to the waves and gazing at the stars when I thought I saw a metorite. Yet, it I thought it was strange that the light appeared on the horizon looking west at the Gulf of Mexico and moved upward into the sky in a 45 degree arc. I payed closer attention thinking it might be a satellite or who knows maybe the space shuttle was up in a mission ( I didn&#39;t really know...but I have seen the shuttle coming in before in the evening sky in my home state of Texas)...anyway this is where is gets strange...as the pinpoint of white light arched across the sky it got larger...it was spherical in shape (about the size of a fingernail at arms length)  and I noticed a color shift to orange. It seemed to emit a hazy glow maybe from heat...then, as it continued to arch across the sky I noticed that it was not flying a straight course but was oscillating rapidly up and down as it continued moving forward...seemed unstable...then it dropped down approx 500 to 1000 feet, hovered for an instant and then did a reverse arch back and above its original course and finally proceeded to the SouthEast at 5 times the speed it was moving before...It just dissapeared. Never seen anything like this...don&#39;t know what to make of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting weirded me out...and I&#39;m not really in to this kind of thing...hope the information helps...maybe somebody else near Florida saw it that night<n>

Coming out of the trees it looked like a glowing light when it came into view, crystal clear with no obstructions, we could not believe our own eyes, it looked like a flying saucer, we were paralyzed with shock. We kept saying no this is not right, it must be a blimp or plane or something, but we saw what we saw. It flew in a complete straight line and we followed it for approximately 10 minutes. When it went behind the trees we went looking for it, but it was gone nothing we could not understand were it went it was too big to hide. We are normal people who do not see flying saucers, but I am telling you we know what we saw and unless somebody shows me the object again, it was definetly a flying saucer.<n>

When looking at aircraft that are at a high altitude, they tend to look like they are moving very slow. To me, if I had to approximate the land, or near land speed - I would say it was in excess of mach 5 The other oddity is that most aircraft - even at a high altitude tend to leave some sort of sound trail. This did not. That&#39;s what struck me so odd about this. I know it was NOT a &#34;shooting star&#34; as the time rate was far to long. Maybe it was a satellite ?<n>

I crossed the street to situate myself where I could watch the object pass the moon.  As it passed, I saw that there was no physical body to the object outside of the glowing ball and a slight residual light (same color) trailing upward.  I ran the remainder of the way to my friends house and got her to come outside as well.  The object was now some distance across town to the east, but still visable.  After aproximately five seconds, the object began to pulsate between a brillant light and fading out four times and then took off in a flash EastNE with amazing speed, leaving a meteorite like streak trailing behind it.<n>

It took about 2 seconds to cover the distance of the diameter of the moon.  The object was moving approximately from west to east.  There were no clouds in the sky at the time. Object was lit by moonlight or would probably have not have been noticed. I would have thought it was a cloud by the general coloring and appearance if it were not for the fact that it was extremely symetrical, it did not change shape or fade, and there were no other clouds present in the sky.  The size of the image was about 3/4 of the size of the image of the moon in the sky.  I&#39;m just curious if anyone else saw something that night in the Pittsburgh sky.  A few seconds after witnessing the event I did hear what sounded like a loud jet, but I live in an urban area with a great many noise heard from multiple sources.<n>

We lost track of it and then noticed a similar light in the northern sky.  The light then faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an overcast day with no sky visible, just clouds.  My friend and I were driving north on 2nd Ave S in Waite Park, MN when I noticed bright white light in the western sky to my friend.  I commented on it and asked my friend &#39;what in the hell that was&#39;.  He thought it might have been an airplane, but I thought it was too bright.  I took my eye off the object when we neared an intersection.  I lost track of the light and dismissed it as mildly unusual.  As we cleared the intersection, still headed north bound we both noticed an identical light in the northern sky.  It was easy to follow, because we were driving in that direction.  We watched the light for approximately 5 seconds when it seemingly lost its illumination slowly.  It seemed to take a couple of seconds for the light to disappear.  When it did there was no visual evidence of anything else in the sky, no aircraft, no nothing.  By the way the light dissapated I thought it might be some sort of flare, but there was no ascent or descent of the light, rather it seemed to just disappear.  It seemed possible that it may have been an aircraft, but the light was too bright and didn&#39;t seem to move and with the cloud cover being so great or distance of vision would have noticed a movement in an aircraft.  The light never blinked, but seemed to be greatly illuminated.  There were no towers or tall buildings in that area. In both cases the object appeared to be around 30 degrees ascension. I would have dismissed one strange light, but two in totally different areas of the sky in such short a length of time didn&#39;t make any sense to me or my friend.  The bright white light was not huge in diameter. It seemed bigger than an airplane light.  It was hard to gauge the distance, but like I mentioned earlier, it was overcast so it couldn&#39;t of been really far away. My witness and myself are in or mid 20&#39;s, don&#39;t do drugs, are sane individuals who witnessed something unusual.  Any feedback on other simmilar sightings, or some sort of explanation would be great!<n>

As I ran down the stairs, he was looking up at the sky, muttering &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;  A glowing orange light was hovering above us, much lower to the ground than any kind of aircraft.  He said it came from the eastern horizon, and by the time I got downstairs it was heading west.  At one point it actually appeared to slow down as it went over us.  We stared at it for approximately 5 minutes before he left for work.  I remained outside for another 5 minutes or so as it continued moving west over our apartment complex.  I left the house about 6:00 a.m., and it was still visible.  It began leaving a &#34;trail of light&#34; for lack of a better term.  It&#39;s like it was about to fizzle out, but never did. He and I and a few others experienced the same lights on 12/31/99.  There were three of them at that time.  I dismissed the event since there were quite a few fireworks in the area.  He kept insisting that we saw something quite unusual - I doubted him until this morning.  I have never experienced anything like it.<n>

Within minutes we heard the sound of non commercial jet aircraft over the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While camping at Alamo Lake State Park last Wednesday night (04-12-00) at ~ 9:45 pm I witnessed a bright orange light high in the northern sky.  At about 8:30 pm my brother also spotted a very similar light in the sky.  The only practical assumption we made was that they had to be the burners to hot air balloons.  But hot air balloons usually only take off in the dense cold air, not in hot air.  Furthermore, the solid angle of the light was too large to be a hot air balloon so far away.<n>

The light was below the clouds, and contiunued to approach until at a 75 degree angle off the horizon.  Made no sound, looked like a small flame in the sky. Movements appeared slow, then it stopped for a short time.  It then changed direction, and traveled back to the northeast.  A ball of light followed by short streamers was then emitted from the bottom of the light.  It then proceeded to disapear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occured in eastern Eugene, almost above the city of Springfield.  I was returning home from eating dinner at a restraunt with a date when we observed a light about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It was initially at too far a distance to see clearly, but as it approached I realized it didn&#39;t have the usual aircraft lighting.  I proceeded to pull the car into a parking lot and stopped to look at the light, now almost above us, at a 75 degree off the horizon. The light&#39;s intensity seemed to flux as it faded in and out.  Note: This effect was clearly NOT due to haze difracting the light.  The light made no sound at all.  The sky was cloudy that night, and the craft was definately below these clouds.  The moon was behind us, allowing the craft to shine clearly against the cloudy sky.  The light is best described as a small flame, similar to a lit candle.  No clear shape was observed.  I was in the parking lot for about 30-45 seconds.  Another car had pulled in and seemed to observing the same light.  It then began to travel in the Northeast direction and I got back into the car and attempted to get a different view of the light.  My passenger kept an eye on the light when she could for the breif drive to a stop light in which we again had a clear view of the light.  There were at least 3 students in the street yelling and pointing at the same light.  Suddenly, the light emmitted a glowing fireball that shot down towards earth.  The glowing ball emitted had short red fire like streamers.  However, the ball emitted seemed to disapear before it came in contact with the ground.  Trees and structures blocked my view of the ground in relation to the now seemingly distant object.  Everyone starting yelling as others witnessed the event.  I immediatly tried to drive a short distance into a parking lot very close nearby.  As we were driving, the light seemed to disapear.  I had not been drinking at dinner that night, and others were present that witnessed the same strange light. I am a student at the University of Oregon.  I consider myself a scientist, with a fairly good knowledge of physics, astronomy and general science.  I grew up here and know the area well.  This craft was definately not any type of convential aircraft and defies any reasonable explanation that I can give it. I would like to know if radar reports from the airport can be obtained.  Are these public records?  Any direction you can point me in as to which steps I should take next?  I contacted a newstation but I don&#39;t think they took my reports seriously, and dismissed it as a helicpoter in the clouds.  It was NOT a helicopter, unless the military has perfect sound-dampening technology.  Again, it defies any explanation I can give it. Did anyone else report anything that night?<n>

It reversed course which proved it wasn&#39;t a satellite or airplane. Also, it was going to slow to be a meteorite, but still pretty fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking around the constellation Canis Major(particulary around the star Sirius) through my telescope. My telescope is an 8 inch newtonian reflector, I was using the 25mm lense, if that helps at all. The background was a few stars seen only through the telescope and of course, space. The object zoomed across my line of vision, I could tell it was going very fast, but it was far away. It didn&#39;t flash across so it definitly wasn&#39;t a meteorite, which would have been disproved anyway by the fact that it reversed course. I was by myself. This was in the south and slightly to the east, and like a said around the constellation Canis Major which would put it about 50 degrees above the horizon. At first it was heading down at an angle, but when it reversed it&#39;s course it was heading up at the same angle. It was a very short sighting. I happen to be an aviation enthusiast and know for a fact there is no way it was any KNOWN aircraft. The fact that it reversed course rules out it being in orbit as well. I know I&#39;m stumped.<n>

As we walked we noticed that over a hill top were 3 lithgs that stayed still over the mountain perhaps 100 feet in the air.  It was very dark and no lights were around us, the only light that lit the night was the stars and the moon. Then both lights moved up a little and kind of liked hubbured up I thought they could have been planes or helicopters but bot in that region because it was very forest like and no real civilization or evolution coud have hit it.  The weardest thing was when a third object came out of nowhere and aproched them its as if it was there leader because they then all hubbured left fast perhaps 300 feets spread apart evenly.  after maybe 1 minuete all at the same time flu upward into the sky like a rocket but faster in 2 seconds then disapeared into the heavens.  What was weard also is that the mom of the girl said she felt that she knew who they were and that she had seen lights like that before in the past but always thought nothing if it until know that made such a fuss about it.  That just made me think that she may have been abducted in the past, and even the possability that they may have had wiped any other memorys besides the seeing of the light.  But could that be possible and also returning her there at the same time.  I didn&#39;t share it with the two but me and my sister when we were little kids also seen five lights with strange movments and forming a strange patter in the skys over the delano california skys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I pointed out the north star, then turned. In the south-east sky I noticed a small white light moving quikly south-east, I pointed it out to my friend and told her that it was a satilite, as I have seen many of them on clear nights. I had just pointed it out when it suddenly made a 90 degree left turn. Which suprised me, because I have never seen a satalite make a 90 degree turn. At that point the object slowed to a stop. Then, took back off in the same direction, north I believe, then slowed to a stop again before fading into darkness.<n>

All of the sudden the white light that eminated from the craft disappeared and appeared the other side of our location. Then the light shot up into the sky and we all decided that this was a ufo<n>

There was no sound.  After I had watched it for about 5 seconds I saw a blank space in the middle that gave it the appearance of two chevrons of bright lite stuck together. Then it immediately went out: zip nada nothing left.  It  was eerie. On 4/7/00 my husband and I had observed same lite (10xs bigger than Saturn.) This time it was higher in sky and was not moving forward.  We did not see any blank spaces. That night it faded then blinked out. The nite of 4/07/00 there were two jets doing some kind of maneuvers in the sky just prior to sighting.  We had been watching them and when they were headed East over the mountains to Fairchild (we assumed) was when we saw the light.<n>

I know that it was very much darker than the star lit sky in the background. I could make out its shape against the background. A red light on each point also helped me to determine its shape and movement. As it moved across the sky, it rotated from point to point, i should say it flipped. It flew as if it was tumbling across the sky, but in a regular fassion, meaning that you could set your watch by its flip. It would flip, a second or two would go by and then it would flip again. It did this continuously as it moved across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Not unusual, as that the National Guard flew C130s in the area, but NOT on a Wednesday in the Spring. The craft then turned to the north and it was then I noted the lights in a odd pattern: a small triangle of red ligts (small point at the nose of the craft), with a slightly larger triangle of blue-green lights (small end attached to the nose setion) as the fuselage. Due to the distance from me, I cannot give a accurate size, though I would guesstimate it to be slightly bigger than a military cargo plane.  As it was turning north sharply, it&#39;s speed was faster than most planes I have witnessed, but unlike other high speed turns, it did this without any engine noise. After moving slightly north, it turned back to the west, again silently, and was gone. What makes the sighting even more interesting ws that f! or two to three hours afterwards, pairs of military jets were seen and heard patroling the area. Not protocol for a Wednesday night, I assure you. I am in the military, and I have flown most of my life, and to this day,I have never seen or not-heard an aircraft like the one I witnessed that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Beings onboard!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving to work around 10:00am. It was April of 2000. The sky was overcast with loght grey clouds. As I was making my way around a curve in the road, something caught my eye. Something very large was moving very slowly just cross the tree tops. I slowed down even more to get a good look at this thing. I stopped and hung in the air over the road about 30 yards in front of me. I stopped to look at it. It was dark grey. About 50 feet long. (The road is about 25 feet wide, and this thing was more than twice that long.) The shape put me in mind of a dumbbell. Larger sphears on each end with a narrower cylendar like center. Each end had a window that was about 5 feet high and went the width of more than half of the radius. The center cylendar also had a like window down the side. The out side of the ship was made up of triangle panles. In the window I could see at least 3 beings looking at me. The one turned his head to another, then quickly looked back at me. the other one moved very fast to the other end of the ship. I could see him through the windows. Then the ship took off with amazing speed. I hit the gas to see if I could tell where it was going. It shot off at tree top level, then made a curve up to the sky. The ship went from standing still to vanishing in less than 3 seconds. I have thought of this everyday from that moment on. I have told a few people, but it sounds kind of crazy, so I have not brought it up. Has anybody seen anything like this? It made no sounds. No lights. Nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

The sun was down and just before the stars really shine bright, the lights on the object were very dim (like the background stars) and were moving from the south to the north (pretty close to north to south).  There was no sound, you would really have to strain to see it as I was trying to see the birds and the lights were very dim.  Looking up at the object it looked like it was at a fairly high altitude but was fairly big.  If it was high in the sky then it was really huge and if it was low then it was small or like any other plan airline (747) and did not make any noise at all.  If memory serves me (40 minutes ago) there was about 3 lights on each side when I viewed it. I have seen planes in the sky before and have not found that there are that many lights on the wings and the wings were not set at the same angle that I viewed this time.  I only hope someone else has seen it too.<n>

Just these circle things in the sky. And we also get it on tape. we watched ot over and over again. We have about 4 mins of it. They just where flyinh around in the sky. One came really close over the trees in the forest. The forest is about 150 ft away from us. I new from the moment i saw it that it was a ufo.<n>

I happened to look up and coming straight at me was a metallic pinkish object shaped like a cigar. Light was glowing off of it and it was going more than 100 miles an hour. It stopped right in front of my car and that was the last thing I remembered before I woke up. I have flashes of memory that I seem to recall being held to a table but I couldn&#39;t feel any straps or restraints. I was very very cold and I heard a high-pitched buzzing the entire time. When I came to I was laying in the backseat of my car. I could smell a burning smell like the wires in my car were fried. It was dark and when I got home it was about 4 and a half hours later. I went to sleep and slept for about 14 hours. Just yesterday I noticed I had 2 bright red scars running parallel to each other along my back. I read somewhere that unexplainable scars or missing time were 2 sure signs of abduction so... I really was sceptical at first but now I&#39;m grateful for people like you helping us.<n>

I used my Olympus C-900 Zoom digital camera set to Super High Quality (1.3M pixel&#39;s) setting. A few days later I uploaded the images into my laptop computer and noticed the object in the upper right corner of one photo. When I zoomed in as much as I could (using PaintShopPro) the object looked metallic but I couldn&#39;t tell anything else. I don&#39;t recall any noise from a plane or anything such like at the time. It may be obvious to you as to what it may be I&#39;d like to know otherwise I&#39;ll continue thinking that it was probably a UFO. I&#39;m reporting this incident just in case someone else has made a similar report for that time and with my report it helps you explain what it is. I have not made any changes to the photo what so ever and the date+time of the file is as was loaded from the camera, using a floppy disk adaptor.<n>

4/9/00 01:10|Oceanside (5-10 minutes drive /miles south of)|CA|Fireball|0.5 to 1 sec.|Bright fireball low in the southeast sky.  Primarily white, although with a greenish tint.|4/15/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12578.html|158|ndxe200004| Bright fireball low in the southeast sky.  Primarily white, although with a greenish tint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving south on interstate 5 about 5 or 10 miles south of Oceanside, CA.  This is in north San Diego county.  The highway heads generally south by southeast, not counting the curves, of course.  I noticed a bright light source in the upper left corner of the windshield.  I had emerged from a point along my line of sight where it was blocked by the roof of the car.  In less than a second, it disappeared behind some high ground that was fairly near the highway. The light source had the appearance of a fireball; mostly white but with a greenish tint.  It was about the size of the cross-section of a pencil held at arm&#39;s length, or about half the diameter of my smallest fingernail.  It had a divided tail, more distinct along the top and bottom of the tail, and less distinct in the center.  It was bright but not uncomfortable to look at, akin to looking at a bright streetlight.  I can&#39;t give a very good account of my position, or its direction from me, or the angle above the horizontal when it disappeared; I was busy driving.  I thought for a moment about what I had seen, then remembered to look at the clock.  The clock read 1:11.  I guessed that I had actually seen the fireball at 1:10. Here are some impressions (as opposed to observations).  The fireball seemed to come roughly out of the northwest and to be heading roughly southeast.  I had that impression that it was heading away from be at about a 45 degree aspect (as if I were going south and it was going southeast).  I guessed that it was coming down at about a 45 degree angle, although the down angle looked more like 60 degrees because of the aspect angle (my impression of it).  It did not look simply like a round light source; I could see irregularities.  I could also see irregularities in the tail.  From this, I think that it was close (whatever that means, in a relative sense, for fireballs).  It looked so low to the ground and was moving so fast (about 10-15 degrees line of sight in less than a second) and coming down at such a steep angle that I was sure that it would hit the ground.  I saw no evidence of any such hit (such as a brighter flash, for example).  (note: using a fist at arm&#39;s length as 12 degrees) In thinking about the tail, it doesn&#39;t seem likely that the split appearance was due to any asymmetry in the object.  That is certainly possible, of course.  It seems more likely, though, for the tail to be eminating from the &#34;limb&#34; area that was closest to the undisturbed air.  That is, for the tail to be coming off in a ring, forming a hollow cylinder behind the fireball.  In looking roughly tangent to the cylinder (at the edge), the observer would be looking through more of the tail material than when looking at the middle.  This would (I think) result in the effect that I saw.<n>

After the 747 passed by I was looking at the clouds formation. Since it was a very bright and glaring day I wore my red tinted sunglasses that reduced the glare alot so I was able to make out shapes of the clouds. As I watched I noticed this formation in the clouds that very dim (The clouds were about 10,000-11,000 ft up) They were very dim and white I thought they might be stars, but they changed shapes. And were in a perfect formation. The first formation was of a diamond formation with two objects away in the formation. Second there were about 8-9 objects in the formation. And they seemed to go in and out of the clouds. I thought It was balloons there were loose but they were too high. They seemed to change into different formations and fade or go higher. After watching these I noticed a &#34;Silver&#34; egg shaped object go from west to east over downtown and it was at least 2500-3000 feet up There was no sound or shape they I would see as a airplane because I study and watch aircraft all the time and play the &#34;Microsoft Flight Sim 2000&#34; This object that was silver just flew over the city and the other formations seemed to fade away. I think They were using the clouds as a cover because of the brightness and they wouldnt be seen. Well, I saw them.<n>

And on April 8,2000 I was in Downtown Seattle at about 6:30 pm. Up in the sky was a British Airways 747-400 flying over downtown Seattle heading North. As I watched it fly over it was about 2500 ft up and the sky ceiling was about 15,000 with partly overcast but bright skies. I noticed  what I thought to be the big dipper out early  ( I have these red tinted sunglasses that reduce the glare alot). I watched the glowing objects which were about 8 of them just stay in a formation that looked like the big dipper. But then they moved into a diamond formation and then a circle formation, and then a pointed arch similar to a arrowhead. I was quite in disbelief because I was watching a formation of objects in the clouds that looked like stars, and were in a perfect lineup of the other in otherwords they didnt move out of formation. I watched them float thru the clouds and and other objects seemed to turn on at the bottom of the formation. And then in the corner of my eye I caught a object heading over the tops of the downtown buildings at a great speed. I watched it soar just over the buildings and I saw it perfectly. It was chrome,kinda eggshaped, and the size of a small airplane similar to a &#34;Pipercub&#34;. It had no wings,no jet intake or outlet,no sound,no lights, and no windows. I watched it fly over and disappear over the buildings. The original formation seemed to be in a circle formation when it passed over, kinda like they were watching it. Noone else seemed to see I was in shock! And then the original formation seemed to disappear in the clouds. No jets from McChord AFB were flying after the objects, and I still see it so clean in my mind. Just so everyone knows. Iam studying for my private pilots license, and I know what aircraft look like. This wasnt an aircraft. And no Government, or person for now on can tell me UFO&#39;s dont exist! I saw something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  A British Airways 747 can be seen flying to the north over the University District of Seattle almost nightly at between 1815 and 1830 hrs. (PDT).  Please see similar sounding reports from Ketchikan, AK, in late May 2000, and Hawaii on 03JN00.))<n>

About 10 minutes before the actual siting I was driving along &amp; I approached an overpass, which I thought was strange being out in the middle of a wildlife conservation area but I passed under it, I saw the sides of the bridge, the sound of going under a bridge was there as well as the shadow that bridges cause, all these things were there, but after I passed under it I looked in my rearview window &amp; there was no bridge at all, there was nothing there. I slowed my car &amp; looked behind me to get a better look, but strangely enough, the bridge wasn&#39;t there, but I SWEAR it was there!  Well, I continued driving yet now more alert, out of the edge of the trees (Beach trees mind you, these were not as tall as normal trees) I saw a strange formation with bluish white lights just above the trees. I past it &amp; slammed on my brakes &amp; got out of my car to see what it was. I had to get out in the middle of the street to see it over the trees &amp; there it was, nothing was holding it up, it just hovered there. It was just over the trees, it was very big &amp; low to the ground, if I had been on the highest tree I think (assuming) that I would be able to touch it. The craft was a diamond shape, I drew it when I returned home. There was a big bluish light on the bottom of the craft that covered most of the underneath &amp; along the sides/edges of thecraft were the same bluish white lights yet smaller. The light was very bright but it didn&#39;t hurt my eyes to look at it, it just illuminated the craft. I just stood there looking at it &amp; b/t the lights was this scaffolding of metal, but the brightest most beautifully colored chrome silver I&#39;d ever seen. It was really beautiful. There was no sound emitting from it, the night was silent. I just stood there watching it, hypnotized it seemed by it &amp; then all of a sudden I was overcome with a fear/ terror that I had never before experienced in my entire life. I ran to my car, my heart was racing &amp; I sped away. I kept feeling as if I should turn around &amp; go back but that strange fear kept me from doing so.   About 5 miles down from that a van came racing up behind me, VERY fast &amp; passed me continuing to speed away- my hunch is that they saw the same thing I did &amp; got the heck away from there! *I do not take drugs of any kind &amp; I was completely sober during this whole experience. That&#39;s why it impacted me so much, it happened exactly as I have related it here.* **Do you have any explanation or other sitings that were reported thatsame time, place, &amp; night? Any information would GREATLY be appreciated!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry I just gave the full description above. I didn&#39;t know that this was here! The summary description is that I saw a diamond shaped craft illuminated with a bluish-white light &amp; no sound came from it &amp; nothing held it up. It was very big &amp; low to the ground, about 13-14 feet above me off to the left of me, just over the trees.<n>

We have been have thunder storms tonight, and at first I thought it was some odd thunder, (but there was no flash) then I hear immediately following the &#34;Booms&#34; this rumbling sound, it sounded exactly like what we used to use in the theater to make thunder sound, (a sheet of steel that was shaken).  This sound continued for several seconds, again it was no thunder.  This sound traveled from West to East as it passed over head.  There was nothing to see due to the heavy cloud cover.  It definitely sounded man made and very &#34;metallic&#34; in nature.  The second it started I thought about the descriptions I heard last night on Art Bell&#39;s show.  The one woman said it sounded man made and I think I know why, it sounded like steel, very distinctive.<n>

I had just pulled over to the curb in the 22000 block of 6th Ave. in order to receive another assignment by radio from our dispatcher, when the whole top of the dash and everything around me outside flashed a brilliant electric bluish color--about the color of a mercury vapor lamp. I looked out the windshield and saw a large oval shaped light streak from approximately directly overhead, and a little to the east, as I was parked facing directly South. The light appeared to be oval in shape, and either very close or very large, which would be dictated by the objects actual location from my vantage point. As this object decended, at an estimated 30 degree angle, it appeared to slow down somewhat and disappeared at approximately 5 degrees above the horizon, which could be discerned by the naked eye.  The width of the object was approximate 1/8th of an inch at arms length! This object was observed for approximately 4 seconds. There were no observed aircraft in the area at this particular time, which was somewhat unusual, as at about this time in the morning, Sea-Tac airport starts to come alive for the day.  This is the second sighting of this type that I have witnessed in this same local, and was an almost identical repeat!  The other sighting occurred at almost exactly one month ago, and was sighted going through and between the clouds.  This morning, 04-07-00, was almost crystal clear, with some low clouds far to the East.  I didn&#39;t report the first sighting because of time constraints-job wise- and due to the fact that I thought it was a really neat thing to witness, as I have seen many objects of this type when we lived in southen Arizona, and just outside the perimeter fence of Sandia Labs, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, many of which I have documented.  The information supplied herein is the best that can be provided short of making a video.<n>

4/6/00 20:35|Arlington|TX|Light|12 Sec.|Two, bright Green Lights, orbs or UFO's, traveling at a High rate of speed with one orange companion object dancing around the lead obj|4/15/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12556.html|168|ndxe200004| Two, bright Green Lights, orbs or UFO&#39;s, traveling at a High rate of speed with one orange companion object dancing around the lead object<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would definately like to state that what you are about to read is true as stated. This is the first time I have ever seen such a sighting. I had gone outside to observe the stars for a while before going to bed, I was standing facing south and looking at the Orion Nebula, when something caught my eye coming over our house. Looking almost directly straight up and just slightly south, I observed a bright green light, the green was the same color as the green of a traffic light and about the same brightness. The size was about the same size as Venus looks in the night sky. The green object was traveling at a very high rate of speed. What looked like about four times the speed of aircraft passing over the same area. This object took about 12 seconds to go from almost straight up and about 10 degrees south to completely out of sight over some trees down the street looking north. When I first saw the green light I noticed that there was another object just like the first one also green in color, same brightness and also traveling the same direction and speed. This object was just to the right of the first object, and slightly behind it. I remember thinking, &#34;is this a low-flying aircraft?&#34; &#34;It sure is moving fast for an aircraft&#34;. Then I grabbed my binoculars to try to get a better look at the objects, When I viewed the leading object through the binoculars, I noticed that I could see the clouds behind the object and that there was no body or wings visible. The clouds were illuminated by the city lights, which made it a rather brightly lit evening, especially for 9:35PM. I could clearly see the clouds contrasted against the object as it moved under them. The clouds were patchy and scattered, and spread out evenly across the sky except for further north, where they were denser. You could also see many stars between the clouds. These objects did not look anything like stars, since they were moving at a high rate of speed. I also noticed that there was no solid object attached to these lights; they seemed to be traveling by them selves. There was one aspect to this sighting that I thought was a bit strange, the objects seemed to be gaining speed rapidly, just prior to dropping down and disappearing behind the trees, which were about a quarter of a mile away. Early in my observation, when I first spotted the leading object looking through my binoculars, I noticed an orange much smaller light or object that seemed to be dancing very rapidly back and forth going past the green object in either direction, not a tight zigzag but a much more exaggerated movement, and quite rapid, more so than what would be expected for eye movement or movement of the binoculars. I could see the green object at the same time as the orange one and could tell that it was moving past the green one in a rapid movement. I was also able to pan the green object fairly easily allowing me to view the orange object as it danced around or back and forth by the green object. The orange object otherwise kept pace with the leading green object as it traversed the sky. There were no sparks, or tails visible and there were no flashing or strobe lights visible at any time on any of these objects. This whole episode caught me totally by surprise, as I had gone out to do some star gazing, not UFO gazing. I had not planned on looking for anything strange tonight. This has left me totally spooked and quite excited, definitely High Strangeness. This is the first time I have ever seen anything quite like this; it truly made my night. What I have described above was not the planet Venus or Jupiter, or a star. I was able to see both planets during this sighting. It also was not an aircraft, balloon or a helicopter as there was no sound at all, emanating from this object., and it moved much too fast and smoothly. ((name deleted)) UFO-PI<n>

There were no sounds as the objects were flying across the sky.they also traveled faster then a airplane  but slower then a shooting star and they werent lite up like a shooting star would be.After i watched it  fly away i stayed out for a few more minutes  but did not see it again.<n>

An odd pink with green ribbon like glow in the sky extended from east to west. We saw this glow from about 8 to 9:30 PM. I don&#39;t think it was cloud a reflection off the sun because it was too late and high flying planes flying overhead were not obscured by the glowing streak. The glow seemed to form lighter rays that moved. Did anyone else report seeing this? Yours Truly ((personal data deleted))<n>

I didn&#39;t pay much attention until I noticed several minutes later that the object had not moved. It was too high for a helicopter to hover and we live in a rural mountainous area with no reason for a helicopter to hover at night.  I got my binoculars to check it out and it seemed so strange I called my wife to come look. She also got binoculars and we watched it for several minutes.  She also said it looked very strange. Then we noticed another object much farther away and above the stationary object, that was travelling very fast and leaving a trail similar to a comets trail. It also was a white light but so far away that that was all we could see. The stationary object had a bright pulsating light that flashed about once a second. Between flashes you could see two red lights both on the right side of the white light. While we continued to watch it a plane came into view flying toward us and the lights on the object immediately went out.<n>

Flight speed/velocity was very high. On zeroing and focusing this object, it propelled at a fantastic speed/velocity and in about two to five seconds it dissappeared into the sky. I looked back up into the same direction of the  skies and suddenly saw another simeilar flying object about 10 degrees to my left ( heading west on Highway 175) from the first sighting in my moving vihecle. This second object also flew very fast that it dissappeared into the skies in about the same time and speed/velocity as the first sighting. I called 911 on my cell phone and was given a number to call and report my sighting. Note: After merging into I-635 north at about the Seagoville Road exit, I did see a flying jet (aeroplance that does appear the same as my previous sighting- because it had a parrellel or straight shape) heading east (at about 15:31p.m. Texas time) and it did not speed or move in the skies as fast as the circular objects that I saw previously and did not dissappear so fast as my first other two observations did. In fact the aeroplane or jet stayed in sight untill I hit the Gross road exit on I-635 north in mesquite.<n>

I also had a pair of Redtail hawks that had been released back to the wild a few weeks earlier who stayed close to my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a nice sunny afternoon when my husand and daughter and and I were outside cleaning animal pens when all of a sudden I heard the pair of Redtai hawks flying over the top of my house in a circle, both of the hawks were screaming vocal warnings of something they viewed as a dangerous, and or threatening to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house to get my binoculars, when I heard and feel my house rumble from the jets over the top of my house.  When I went back outside I could see the jets over my house they were jets hundreds of feet over us, while the hawks were flying above the jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up above me with my binoculars to see what was all the commotion was all about.  This is when I saw the UFO!  It was a couple of hundred feet over me!  It blended in so well with daytime sky that without the bionoculars you would have never been able to see it!  It was about 30 feet across, round I shape and almost the color of the sky, gray-blue-silver.  No sound came from the UFO!  Only the noise from the two Jets!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could only see the bottom of the UFO.  I was able to observe the UFO for approx 7 minutes before it took off.  It went straight up and was gone in a flash!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate.  PD))<n>

The lights (that were alternating blue, red and white) were at the same height but they were separated from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please excuse my English, I am not native English speaking. At approximately 22:00 hours we saw two strange lights coming up over the ocean as we were walking on the beach. The lights (that were constantly changing blue, red and white) were at the same height but they were separated from each other at what seemed to be about the size of a golfball for me. It was sitting there for a minute (app. 30-sec.) and than it moved closer to us toward the beach, as we all got excited about what this could be I was walking closer to the beach and continues focusing my eye on the lights. The lights now were separated at such a way that I could fit a pencil in between. The strange thing is that because the sky was so clear and I had my eye’s focus so much on the object that I could now see that their was a very black “ufo looking” shape in between the lights and the lights seemed to be at the end of  “the wing” of the disk. I am not that good in distance estimation but I believe the object was now above the ocean with at least 750 meters away from us and it had reach a higher position. While the lights were still seem to move toward us the object al of the sudden turned around 180* upside down. Than the object very quickly seemed to move away from us and the lights became very weak and blurry. Than I lost track of the lights and they seemed to have disappeared. App. 30 seconds after that one of us saw it again at a complete different distance. It was now very high in the sky and far away. We say it a couple of times at certain positions far away for a second or two during about 1 minute. This was an unidentified flying object because it couldn’t possibly be an airplane or anything from earth that could do this kind of movements. I am an exchange student in the US from Kentucky and I was staying at Ocean City as a tourist while we were touring trough Maryland. I have no intention what so ever too tell you about the little green aliens because there were none; the above description is what we saw and noting more or less. After analyzing my story I would appreciate an email from an investigator about the possible explanations of what this could have been.<n>

The object turned and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my backporch with my daughter when I was pointing to an airliner flying over.  My eyes caught unto a cylnder object hanging in the air like a piece of string.  The object was a long cylinder shape, mettallic, and the sun was reflecting off of it which is how it caught my eye.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but when I focused on it closely it was nothing resembling any airplane I ever saw. I watched the object as it slowly rotated to its side and started to move across the sky. Thats when I noticed the airforce jets coming in.  I called my wife and tried to show her the object but she couldnt find the right postition in the sky.  As I was watching the object and showing her the object bent into a boomerang shape and whent in a new direction. The object picked up speed and seemed to compress and was gone. I dont know if it accelerated or just vanished.  About 3 minutes after that my wife and I was discussing it when in that exact same spot smoke started to form and shape into a ring. the ring moved across the sky for a good ways before dissolving. My wife saw that.  From the distance in the sky where the jets and the objects were the smoke ring had to be huge. As I look back on it I would say those jets were chasing the object or at least trying to get to it. And I cant say for sure but for some reason I think if the sun had not been reflecting off of the object it would have been invisible. I say that because it did not look the way it should look when sun is reflecting off of metal it was almost to bright, like if I had a pair of binoculars and could see the cylinder in detail I would have saw myself perfectly in the reflection.<n>

And I told my daughter, &#34;where is it! Where did it go....&#34;. As it seemed to fly over (according to the soundwave movement) me and my daughter could not see anything. I have a rather large and unblocked view. I felt rather shocked, like a feeling you might get when grasping thin breaking ropes climbing a cliff side. That&#39;s the best way I could describe that feeling. 100% roaring/sizzling/slightly muffled sound passing over and then no visual by me or my daughter.<n>

These red lights lasted only a few seconds. The object then accelerated off in a southwestern direction. I found this quite curious. The day before i had seen several &#34;black&#34; helicopters in the same location. Strange indeed.<n>

It seemed odd because it was a cloudy night and I hadn&#39;t seen any planes because the clouds were low.  I could make it out as a circular object because the white strobing lights on it seemed to go around the object continuously.  About 5 or so of the lights in a row seemed to go from left to right on the object, then dissapear and reappear on the left, seeming as if the lights went around the perimeter of the object.  Besides the 5 or so white strobing lights, there were also a few stationary lights in the colors of red, green, and blue that also flashed but not nearly as fast as the white strobes.<n>

The oval object appeared to be at about 1000 feet off the ground. It was traveling from North to South then changed course to the Southwest. It was tumbling over itself, making a shiny area reflect the afternoon sun. The object moved silently through the sky and disappeared behind the trees. A small plane flew by about 10 minutes after this objects appearance at the same altitude. Just guessing about the size. It must have been as large a commercial airliner. We live 50 miles southwest of the flight path of the airport in Fairbanks and observe many planes daily. I have never seen anything like this before.<n>

I reached over to shake her to see if she would start breathing and this gargoyle type creature arose out of her body and stood up beside the bed. It looked at me and then proceeded to walk through the wall. I wrote to two people the next day and told my associate at school the next day. I proceeded to &#34;forget&#34; the incident until February 27, 2003, when events unfolded in my life which have since led me down my own path of events similiar to  the book called &#34;The Celestine Prophesy&#34;.  I have met people like Dr. Shakundali Modi who has been studying this phenomenon for 20 years and Barbara Bartholic in Tulsa who has been studying this phenomenon for 30 years.  Some of the ramifications of this case have led me to be dismissed by the Iowa MUFON Chapter.  This sighting has been the catalyst for a book that I will cover this case and others in my ten years of investigating UFO&#39;s and other phenomenon in Iowa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (And by the way, I also had a case in my classroom where I watched a student shapeshift into a Reptilian and back in about 10 seconds.

It was hovering at treetop level over a stopsign. I stopped my car when I realized what I was looking at. The UFO seemed to be moving away from me and it stopped also. At this point I panicked, I threw my car into reverse and started backwards flooring it. The UFO starts backwards. Accelerating faster then my car. I flipped off my headlights hoping they wouldnt see me. The car engine then dies when the UFO gets within maybe 20-30 feet in front of me still coming at me. I put my car in park and realized I was the only person out on the road and I was about to get abducted. So I knew I had to wake people up not so much to witness the UFO but to stop the aliens from abducting me. I jumped out of my car and started running down the road away from the UFO screaming the entire time. Luckily] some people in a nearby house heard my screams and ran outside. The UFO had drifted over behind a tree so they couldnt see it, but they did see its lights. Then the lights blinked out and it was gone. I got back in my car and it started right up and I drove home.<n>

The light then rose and approached our vehicle as we traveled at 65mph. We saw a rounded shape with intense white light and alternate bands of bright red light. The red lights pulsated. It stayed over our vehicle for approx 30 seconds matching our speed and then moved off to the Southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just filled our vehicle with gasoline and headed south back to our cabin we were staying in that night.  The weather was light rain with a brisk north wind (approximately 15mph)As we left Graham on HWY 16 we followed another vehicle which turned to the right on Hwy 1287 South. We stayed on State 16. Suddenly an extremely bright light was shinning on our car off to our left. The light was behind some trees but was blinding me; suddenly, it rose in the air and headed straight for our car as we traveled (at approximately 90degrees).  As all of this was occurring, we were talking about something else and were only partially aware of the event. As it got closer we ( approximately 300 yards ) focused upon it with both of us saying &#34;what is that?&#34;.  Out the driver&#39;s window, I could see that there was a cockpit or something under this huge black shape.  I was screaming &#34;what the Hell is that?&#34; The cockpit was shinning this incredibly bright light with some bands of red lights.  The red lights were pulsating. The object kept approaching us until it was directly over the car. It then matched our speed (still 65mph)and my friend looked up and sort of gasped. She said that the lights are alternating. All of this time we were both asking &#34;what is this?&#34;.  As it traveled Southwest off to some low hills it disappeared.  Neither one of us said anything for a while.  Then she asked what I saw and I asked her what she saw.  We both saw the same.  When we got back to the cabin, which was about 30 minutes later we took some sheets of paper and sat across the room from each other and drew what we saw.  The drawings matched! We then called the Sheriff&#39;s office in Graham and asked about aircraft or helicopters. He called the local small airport and they had nothing up. On Monday I called Carswell AFB and they had nothing out that way at that time.  I called the DFW control center and they reported no aircraft flying that low on Saturday near Graham. ( Graham is 96 miles from the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. Neither of us can forget what we saw and are anxious for someone to solve this mystery.  If you have any answers, we would definitely love to hear from you.  Apart from nearly blinding us with that bright light and scaring us no harm was done.<n>

I was on a caldera (extinct volcano) at about 10,000 feet watching a meteor shower. I heard two meteors at the time of their dissipation. Sounded like distant thunder (maybe it was!) or maybe it was a large meteor that had fell earlier, or maybe the meteors upon hitting the earth&#39;s atmosphere had generated a electromagnetic frequency that effected the human brain and auditory system and caused the sound instantly instead of the delay caused by sound waves.

As we drove closer It moved above the trees on the left side of the road.  It was a dark ball with a beam of light coming from left side of craft.  Light seemed to cut off rather than dissipate.  When we were right next to the craft (approx 200 ft. max) A diamond pattern of lights, yellow, red blue, and green, flashed rapidly.  The craft then appeared to turn in out direction at which time the pedal hit the metal and we were outta there.  This sighting was approx 5 miles north of Copemish<n>

We were watching TV when I noticed that a dark object was hovering outside up in the sky approximately 1/4 - 1/2 mile up to the south of his house through an opened balcony door (I was sitting on the floor). There appeared to be blue, green, and red lights turning on and off on the underside of the craft (or whatever it was). My brother had just gotten a new digital video camera so I asked him if I could see it. I obtained approximately 2 or 3 minutes footage of it hovering with the lights turning on and off before it moved to my left (east) and out of my sight behind some trees. The object appeared to descending as it moved out of my line of sight. I saw no other lighting and the object appeared to be hovering when I first saw it. No detetectable sounds or other lighting appeared to emanate from the object.<n>
4/1/00 21:00|Huntington Beach|CA|Light|2:15|Bright star with red flashing|4/15/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12515.html|191|ndxe200004| Bright star with red flashing<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our bedroom window faces south giving us an unobstructed view of the ocean and that part of the sky. We routinely sleep with our blinds open to view the stars... what few of them we can see here in the light polluted southern California sky. At about 9pm I saw what I initially thought was an unusually bright star. It was brighter than anything in the sky. I would describe it as nearly the same color as those new auto headlights... the kind that make other headlights look yellow by comparison. Same with this star -- it made the others look yellow by comparison. Another unusual attribute of this star was that it seemed to flicker more than other stars. At about 10pm I noticed that there was a red flash in the star. I got out my binoculars to confirm. The red flashing didn&#39;t look like that of an aero plane. It was random, not steady like an aircraft. My thought at this time was that is was some kind of natural space event like a sun going nova or something. I hadn&#39;t detected any movement up to this point. I called a couple of my ham radio buddies to ask if they could see it. One could view it by standing on a ladder. It&#39;s about 10:20pm now. My buddy noticed it was moving very slowly... like the minute hand on a clock. He said it was dropping relative to the phone wires. He couldn&#39;t see the red flashes per say, but thought the atmosphere was altering the color and causing the unusual flickering. We also noticed it was starting to dim. From then on I made note of the movement and brightness of the object. At this point I was thinking that it was falling out of the sky and on fire, gradually growing dimmer as the fire burned out... maybe it was a weather balloon. Eventually I threw out that idea and decided it was not falling but remaining an the same altitude and moving south-west away from me... growing dimmer as the distance increased. I continued to observe the object until about 11:15 pm when it went dimmed to nothing. My opinion at this time, Sunday morning, it that this was some kind of very high altitude aircraft.<n>

I was seated on the right side of the plane in the exit row over the wing. As the plane made its&#39; final approach, the sun was setting in the western sky, and it seemed we were in a low level flight path (say 6,000-10,000&#39;) for a period of 10 or 15 minutes (perhaps a holding plan).  During this time, I observed what appeared to be a glass ball only 100-150 ft off the right side of the plane.  The object appeared to be maybe 8&#39; in diameter.  The sunset was shining on the object and was somewhat reflected in the object, such that the round shape of the object was clearly identified. The object was moving in the same direction as the plane, but just slightly slower and slightly lower in elevations such that I initially saw the object ahead of the plane, then watched as the plane slowly passed the object.  I witnessed the object be hidden by the wing as the plane passed, then appeared again behind the wing.  I continued to observe the object until i could no longer see the object from the window as the plane continued to pull ahead.  After witnessing the object, i stood up to see if anyone else in the plane was glued to the window, pointed, talking about it,etc.  I didn&#39;t see anybody else that appeared to have seen the object.  The plane landed.  On the way off the plane, I stopped at the door and asked the flight attendants if I could speak with the pilots (cockpit door closed), but was told no.  I asked if they had seen anything and they stated not. I waited in the terminal for the pilots, but they never appeared from the plane/gate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have others seemed similar objects.  It was awesome and I would love to hear of similar experiences to corroborate my own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

This second plane was a smaller business jet, probably a Cessna Citation as the wings were straight out from the body of the plane. It was flying at around twenty-five to thirty throusand feet in altitude. As I watched the small jet for a moment, two non-twinkling objects about the brightness of medium stars and about the same apparent size passed to either side of the small jet in the exact opposite direction. As the two objects continued in a due west direction and just before passing directly overhead, one object (the one that passed on the plane&#39;s right, or south side) abruptly turned to the southwest at a forty-five degree angle. The other object continued on a little farther and then turned due north. The turn was immediate, not like an airplane making a banking turn. I continued watching this one and in a few seconds it was joined by two more, one coming in from either side and together they formed a triangle, continueing to fly due north. After a couple more seconds, they moved in what I can only describe as a dance as they moved playfully around each other. Almost immediately they were joined by two more, one coming in from each side again. The five ojbects continued north until I could no longer distinguish them from the bright, blue sky. I have since seen (not without some excitement on my part) a report on T.V., with video no less, of almost exactly what I saw. The objects were described as &#39;pearls&#39;. They were the same as I witnessed; silent, white and round and did not seem to give off light of their own. The objects on T.V. were also in diamond formations of many more than I saw (up to thirty at a time). Single &#39;pearls&#39; would even turn away from the others at smooth forty-five degree angles.<n>
