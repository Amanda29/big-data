One morning, my father &amp; I went on a walk near the lodge looking for pine cones. I spotted a large one in a tree &amp; my father worked his way into the branches to get it for me.  Suddenly &amp; silently a small silvery circular craft appeared hovering above us w/2 beings watching us through large goggles or something like gas masks. I screamed at my father to look, but his glasses had been brushed off in the branches &amp; could not ackowledge my sighting. I continued screaming in terror and suddenly the object streaked away without a sound.  Without waiting for my father, I ran as fast as I could back to the lodge where my mother &amp; friend could not console me in my fright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
