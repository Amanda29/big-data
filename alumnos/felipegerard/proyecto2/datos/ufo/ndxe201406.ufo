This thing appeared and was moving rather swiftly toward the South West.  The altitude seemed pretty high which is why I thought at first it was a sattelite but it was moving too fast.  A few seconds after I began watching this thing it stopped, zig zagged back and forth a couple times then lit up extremley bright with a very white light which made it also appear larger in size.  Right after it lit up all bright it changed direction and quickly started heading back in the direction it had just came from, stopped again then shot straight up and out of sight at incredible speed.  This was absolutly not a sattelite or any conventional air craft.  It was also silent and made no noise.<n>

We both exited our house through the back door and onto our deck to see 2 orange pulsating lights, unidentified flying objects, UFO.  They were slowly traveling from a southern direction heading north to north east.  As we were watching them, a moment later a 3rd orange pulsating light appeared from what seem to come from same direction following the first two.  They were traveling in a straight line.  At first, I thought it was a remote control toy, but there was no sound whatsoever.  It was very quiet out in the yard.  My fiancé had his phone and was working on getting a recording of the sighting when a 4th UFO appeared from the same southern direction as the previous craft, heading northern in a straight line.  The whole sighting lasted about 4-5 minutes.  The craft! were lower to the ground as flying below the clouds.  They were NOT any kind of plane, fireworks, floating Japanese lanterns, meteor remnants, fireball, nothing like these things as we educate ourselves as to what flies in the skies and what they look like. These craft were pulsating orange and a white-ish light.  They seemed to appear out of nowhere and disappear after traveling about 3/4 a mile, then vanish.  A very interesting night and with a partial recording of the sighting.  We question as to whether they are new military aircraft, drones, or ET&#39;s??? Prior to this event,  My son and I witnessed another sighting with 7 orange lights traveling in formation heading northern direction in October 2013.  Looked like the same type of air craft to me.  Obviously, something is going on in our skies and we are not the only people who are seeing these orange lights.  They appear to be showing up all over the world.<n>

I went out before her, lit my smoke and from the top of the stairs to our patio, my wife asked asked, “What are those?  They aren’t planes.”  I looked up to where she was pointing to the SSW.  There were two orangish orbs that were flickering slightly. The first thought I had was that they were Chinese Lanterns.  However, the hair on the back of my neck stood up as I realized that they were moving towards us and, far too fast to be any sort of lantern or balloon.  The objects appeared to be at 2,000 - 3,000 feet in altitude, moving at 200-300 miles per hour.  The two objects traveled silently and in apparent formation, perhaps 2,500 feet apart.  They traveled at a constant rate and did not change bearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects approached, not quite overhead, but maybe offset by about 15-degrees from directly overhead, I noticed that the glowing, flickering orange nearly disappeared and I was able to observe the underside of the objects, which appeared round in shape with a dark center and a ring of somewhat dim, fuzzy light around it.  The two objects disappeared behind our building.  I considering running through the front of the apartment to see if I could observe the objects on the other side of the building.  My wife ran inside to grab her camera.  She returned just as a third orb appeared and followed a similar vector to the other two objects. Again, as the third object passed nearly overhead, I observed the same structure as the first two objects.  My wife was able to get one very nondescript, streaked image with her camera but honestly, it doesn’t look like much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident lasted perhaps 30-40 seconds.  After the three objects had passed, my wife and I were somewhat shaken and tried to make any sense of what we had just seen.   They clearly were not any sort of aircraft or drone that I have seen (and I consider myself an aircraft aficionado along with being a drone and R/C aircraft pilot).  The other thought I had were that perhaps they were some sort of debris entering the atmosphere and burning up, but that would not account for what appeared to be a level flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute or so after this, a commercial aircraft crossed the flight path of the objects at a perpendicular angle, heading east.  I have no idea if the pilot of that airliner, likely landing at JFK, was able to see what had just occurred, but I suppose we have no way of knowing.  We checked the internet for any other reports of this incident and found nothing, which is astonishing considering it occurred over New York City.  However, we found Nuforc and filed this report in hopes of anyone else coming out and reporting this.<n>

They were odd, I didn’t realize at first what I was seeing, but in the back of my mind something was telling me to keep checking them out.  I am an aviation buff, love all things that fly, and also know my town pretty well and it didn’t add up that there were lights where they were, and that they didn’t fit anything I had seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second sighting, the first being a single green orb UFO I reported back in 06’ and was with about 10 people who could verify what we saw..<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were a pulsating/light flickering type that change from orange to red, or were red and had an orange hazy light that would come on and overpower the red...hard to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed 1, then I saw 2, then the third as I came into an area that they were in a clearing and could see them.. at that point my jaw dropped and I fumbled to get my cell out and get it in camera mode.. of course it had to pop up with a ton of different warnings about wifi being on so no flash.. blah blah blah.. all those crummy photo messing up blurbs that in this case REALLY cost me some good footage.  I was trying to get to video mode and actually accidentally took a shaky picture of them.  they can be seen in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Okay they were in a triangular formation in the sky, and before or during my trying to take the picture, one I thought had vanished, in the picture it shows the two lower lights coming together more closely.. so that explains that..<n> <n><n> <n><n> A car came up behind me and I HAD to deal with that, I didn’t want to as I was going to miss the event.. errr.. bad dang luck.. so I drove toward them and quickly pulled into a post office parking lot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There I get the truck stopped and jump out...by that time they were a dim flicker in the sky, they had turned a more metallic shimmer and all together vanished :(  I will be keeping my eyes peeled to the sky even more than before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think those of us who are star/sky/nature gazers probably see things that others are too busy in their tech filled lives to notice.

I then saw an orb pass the plane &amp; followed it until it was gone.  I thought since I saw this one, maybe there&#39;s a decent chance I&#39;ll see another if I hike up the hill near where I live &amp; bring the video recorder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was up there for a few hours &amp; saw one other orb that was larger, slower &amp; I believe closer for a short time.  I took some videos of planes passing &amp; there really wasn&#39;t anything very exciting.  Then again, I could hardly see the screen in daylight, even with something I brought to cover my head with the screen.  I wrapped it up &amp; went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then dropped the footage in a video editor.  I viewed a short clip of a plane in the distance that was a bit shaky &amp; short, I was about to hit the delete button, then thought first I&#39;d zoom in on the plane first.  I&#39;m glad I did wow.  I saw an object facing the pilots in flight, but then thought it might be a speck on the lens or screen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I continued looking frame by frame &amp; the object was still there.  When I toggled through the frames, the object appeared to be blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was still not convinced because it was faint.  But then, on ONE particular frame, the object got very bright &amp; much larger with some detail.  My jaw literally dropped, I gasped &amp; covered my mouth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I submitted it on a popular video site.  I show it in the editor including placing some textures to show it &amp; some frame by frames.  It&#39;s quite amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought this could be quite a big deal since the Malaysia flight 370 disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, while I was editing the video, I was listening to KFI radio &amp; they announced that there was an &#34;accidental chute deployment&#34; which was causing the plane to have to be diverted from going to John Wayne Airport, which is where this plane &amp; UFO were headed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When you view the footage, clearly there is no way the pilots didn&#39;t see what was right in f! ront of them.  So maybe we got this on radar?<n> <n><n> <n><n> At least at the ! very minimum, the pilots MUST have told the control tower what they were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe that flight diversion was on purpose to avoid a danger like what happened to the Malaysia plane?<n>

It appeared to be holding a position for 5-10 minutes just above a cloud layer that obscured most of the stars, and could not have been more than a few miles above the ground.  The object appeared to be roughly the size of a house (but I’m normally not a great judge of size at such a distance).  I can say for sure, though, that it was either extremely large, or very close, as in, incomparably larger than the perceived size of a star at my distance.  I should also make clear that we never saw its contours--we only saw the light coming through the dark cloud layer that created the almost starless night, tonight.  It quickly faded to full brightness and back to darkness (as opposed to blinking) periodically, every 5 seconds, the entire time it was in-sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent my friend to retrieve her point and shoot camera, hoping it would have better light sensitivity than my iPhone 5S, but as soon as she returned, the light disappeared. We stared for another 2-3 minutes and it did not return.  Before finally leaving, I walked back inside to attempt to see if anyone had spoken with the New Orleans Police Department, but no one answered their non-emergency line.  After about 20 minutes of that and speaking with my friend about the occurrence, I stepped back outside to leave.  The light was back.  This time, it appeared just to the right of the same pair of stars it had appeared near earlier.  I ran back inside to grab my friend and we watched it pulsate for another several minutes, attempting to video tape, but the light was too faint for the camera.  This time, the light appeared to be moving away and then towards us. I thought I saw a flash or two from possible neighboring objects, but it was so faint that I can’t tell for sure.  My friend als! o claimed that the light was faintly tinted blue, and I may have caught that once or twice, as well, but once again, I can’t tell for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a good bit of thought, the following are the points that stand out to me:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.	  I have only ever seen a combination of red and white lights coming from man-operated aircraft. The fact that this light was purely white is interesting to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. 	The regularity of the pulsating of the light (5 seconds between ON states. For whatever reason, this made me lean towards “man-made.” But, who knows?)<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.	  The size and proximity. My friend suggested that it could be a satellite, but I don’t think it could be so close or so big. I will research the likelihood of this as soon as I’m done filing this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.	  The fact that the object “disappeared” and “returned.” I believe it’s possible that there were multiple thin layers of obscuring clouds, and that enough finally came between us and the object that it was finally obscured completely. Thinking in these terms, its return was simply those clouds continuing past the object. From this, one may conclude that it disappeared and reappeared, or that it never left. From this, one might also infer that it was moving slowy the whole time and was not exactly static as implied in the first paragraph of this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.	  UPDATE: 4:38AM, CURRENT TIME: Said friend just called and said someone walked into her back door (that she negligently left unlocked). She believes she say a T-shirt, so we’ll assume he was human. This most likely has no connection to the white light, but I thought I’d mention it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.	  Apparently, the International Space Station has just passed over us, but that was the evening before this one, Friday June 27 2014 at 8:41PM:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=United_States&amp;region=Louisiana&amp;city=New_Orleans#.U6_1aY1dVH0 a.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the ISS is described as having a constant white light, and specifically not a flashing light, from the two articles I’ve read on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is all!  Decide for yourself!<n>

As it peered closer, the object turned off the red and white lights, and on went blue lights.  Keep in mind that the sky was about 65% clouds so it was out of sight here and there.  As the craft came closer it had a boomerang shape, and the blue lights were on, it looked like this. (sorry I’m a very bad drawer)<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://puu.sh/9P5h6/7bf8839289.png<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was there for less than 30 seconds, it shot off, over 1000 mph.  The craft was not as large as seen in the picture; it was at the cloud line. This object was not right above me, it was about 3 miles away, but it was large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What the craft did- All they did was hover in and out of the clouds before shooting off into the distance.  It stopped after less than ten seconds of flying and lowered. It was over 2 miles away at this time.  At this time I had returned with my phone, and recorded a video of it. I cut out the time in the video when the craft had disappeared.  Shortly after the craft left for the last time I heard a faint boom, I presume a sonic boom from the craft leaving the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shape and Color of Craft- Triangle with blue lights Backgrounds-I myself am a straight A student, that looks at everything.

A few steps ahead of me she called back me, &#34;Honey, what&#39;s that?&#34;, fully expecting me to provide a comfortable and critical natural explanation for the large and very bright light in the sky.  Now standing at the front of the house and facing North I see a very bright sphere of light that I first assume is either a very near and low-flying aircraft or a very large fireball coming straight at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer and cosmology buff for over thirty years.  I am critical nearly to the point of cynical, yet I find myself refusing to admit that what we saw was anything other than unfamiliar or not earthly technology.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking North from the Niagara River the object appeared about 5 degrees above Polaris and appeared to be getting closer as its size and brilliance increased.  A very bright orange/yellow it was similar in size and somewhat in color to the street light on the road in front of our house before it stopped approaching (or increasing in size).  It outshone the streetlight only seven meters away.  Until that moment I was getting a little fearful that this may be a city killer asteroid coming straight at us.  There was no sound and no trail behind it.  It was headed straight at us or it wasn&#39;t a massive bolide at all.  It appeared to slow or stop so the bolide question was answered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened the door to the house and yelled for the children (ages 8 and 30) to rush outside.  The object, now at its nearest, would no longer appear to be coming Southward toward us, but slip Westward at great speed, then stop, then slip on over some more, then stop.  It did this about eight times before remaining stationary.  The whole time it scintillated as the stars do above a moist sky.  The four of us stood there with our eyes trained on it while it begin to shrink and dim in spurts as though it may have been moving away from us the way it had been moving to the West with the jerky movements.  With each successive &#34;pulse&#34; it grew smaller and fainter.  It didn&#39;t seem like it was moving away.  It appeared more like it was just shrinking and fading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea of how large or distant the object was.  I&#39;m no expert at scale. I can only relate the scale by saying the object at its most brightest and biggest was easily as large as my thumbnail with my arm outstretched in front of me.  I spent some of the night and this morning looking for news of sightings over anywhere from Niagara Falls to Ottawa.  I just can&#39;t seem to guess how far it was away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light surrounded the object.  High humidity would have easily revealed beams of light from lamps as it did for every other passing aircraft that night and most nights. There were no beams, just a large, very bright scintillating light moving awkwardly through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I told my wife before sleep, I was so excited to have witnessed the event.  I didn&#39;t know what I invited my children to see.  Did I call my little boy outside to witness the end of his life by an asteroid, or was this an alien craft and what were their intentions?  It was all very exciting and terrifying at the same time.  I have never felt like that before.  Skeptics don&#39;t get much excitement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All my life I have wanted to see a &#34;UFO&#34;.  Two weeks ago my wife and I and one of our sons observed a daytime object and actually had time to retrieve two sets of binoculars for further observation.  I was unable to explain what I saw.  It looked like a large building made of up compartments (cubes) or maybe like a bunch of buildings stuck together. It wasn&#39;t round anywhere.  The Sun reflected brightly from only one small part at a time as it moved across the sky.  The rest of it appeared a dark grey or black.  Without binoculars it simply appeared to be a small ball of light as you would expect from sunlight reflected from a metallic object.  It caught our attention in the first place because it was so high in the sky yet didn&#39;t appear to be moving (like all the rest of high-flying air traffic was doing).  It did move large distances in quick moments somewhat like the ball of light last night.  We lost track of it after each quick shot across some distance, then found it s! tationery ahead of the direction it seemed to go.  We lost it for good the third time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my son, &#34;You are so fortunate to have witnessed such a thing. That could very well have been people from another world!&#34;.  Wow!  I never expected something like that to come out of this skeptic&#39;s mouth.  My childhood dream of seeing a UFO is now fulfilled - twice in one month.  Although my son (age 8) also has his own telescope and a very good knowledge of astronomy and cosmology, I don&#39;t think he entirely grasps the measure of what we witnessed together. I really don&#39;t know exactly what we saw, but I&#39;m still sort of in a state of shock.  I woke up still excited from last night&#39;s events.  My wife and I can&#39;t stop remarking at how last night&#39;s viewing was the first time I did not have my cell phone with me. I could have recorded video...<n>

The fourth object seemed to be trailing the other three.  At first I thought they may be helicopters, but there were no navigational lights on them.  They were moving too slow for any aircraft I&#39;d be familiar with, jet, prop, or rotor wing.  They didn&#39;t change direction.  We watched them until they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a retired military officer, I&#39;m very familiar with aircraft, both civilian and military.  They were about 45 degrees from the horizon.  Not knowing the altitude, it would be a difficult guess as to how large they were.  I would estimate that they would be as large as a private jet.  I would estimate speed of about 70-85 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear, no clouds, no haze.<n>

I was getting close to Scottslawn Rd. when I saw an aircraft of some sort that I initially thought might be circling around to land at Union County airport.  But then it started heading towards me above Rt 33.  It seemed to be rather low, so I paid close attention to it.  As it drew nearer to me I came to realize it did not appear to be an airplane or helicopter.  I got a good look at it as it passed above me out the driver side window.  It was maybe 200 feet up in the air, and it was a hexagonal shape, and on the bottom of the craft, there was a large blue circular light in the middle, and smaller blue circular lights at each corner of the hexagon.  Also, what struck me as being very strange is the craft made no sound.   If it were a jet or any other craft I&#39;m familiar with, at that altitude, it would have been pretty loud.  It was really weird, and freaked me out.  It was headed towards Dublin, OH down rt. 33.  Definitely the weirdest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in person with my own eyes.  There is only 3 possibilities of what it was in my mind, a secret military/government aircraft, a drone (but it was too big to be a drone I think), or an alien spacecraft.<n>

Any way i was looking up in the same area as the last time and noticed a orange ball just bouncing up and down then vanished.  Since the 7/1/12 whenever i go outside i pay attention snd yet a feeling that i get nervouse over what i will see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a third sighting apx. 6/30 i was outside but sitting on my front rs porch and i saw two orange glowing lights again.  They seemed to be headed in the direction of my house side by side moving in a straight direction.  Then changed direction moving south instead of west towards me.  They stayed side by side then just vanished.  I called mufon and made a report here two years ago.  A person from my area was supposed to come over to my hom because of the major sighting and  investigate it due to 3 of us had such a bazzar encounter two years ago and it was hovering over my house for several minutes actually 15 to 20 minutes but he never bothered to come and interview me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So this time i am not bothering with mufon and reporting it here instead. That upset me. Especially since the home base for mufon is here in the Cincinnati area.  I just know now when i go outside i always look up and yet get afraid of what i will see due to such a close encounter i had two years ago on the same date.  That ufo was about 150 to 200 ft over my house and i think or feel like it knew we were paying attention to it. That was a green round disk plus orbs. Moved very slow and hovered right over us.<n>

After it passed me and got a few miles away the light faded out.the light looked to be in the front of the flying object.  It was a red orangish fireball type light.  It was followed up by 2 more flying objects.  They all were a minute apart and about the same elevation and same light and following the same flight path.

They never changed altitude but seemed to stay the same size.  their altitude was above the planes that approached.

My balcony faces north and the object flew right above my house heading north.  As it past my house it made a weird noise too. I can best describe it as the sound when you steam something.  That &#34;tsssh&#34; sound. It was a bit foggy too. So was it going fast enough to cause that noise due to the foggy mist?  Being that I&#39;m on the second floor ( balcony ) I could still see the object. It flew and then stopped in midair about 3-4 blocks north from my house.  It stopped and then descended to where I could not see it anymore because of trees.  I waited of course to see if it&#39;d go back up, and what do you know, it did.  It quickly flew up and started moving left, then right, and vertically up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clearly NOT some airplane.  It looked like it would appear, and then disappear, and appear again to be on the other side of where it! was. There was one major blue/red light that really stood out, but then I saw another light right next to it. Then I could Bailey make out what looked to be one more orb/light trailing with the other two. At one moment I even thought they were a single object. Like one of those triangle UFO&#39;s, but then again my mind might just have wanted to make a picture out of the orbs. This lasted about 2-3mins of my clearly seeing it, and then 2 or so more mins where I could sort off still see it appearing and then disappearing. Oh quick thing too. When I saw it ascending and descending I tried communicating by flashing my lights on and off. Didn&#39;t seem to do anything. Either way this was pretty cool. I was able to record it descending once with my iPhone. So I have proof. Also one more thing at the end I could have sworn I saw it shoot out acouple beams out ( reddish beams ). And even if the trees weren&#39;t blocking my view, I could swear it looked like it at one point might it also mi! ght have landed. I was so close to running outside down the 3-! 4 blocks down to see if I could get a better look. I didn&#39;t though because I didn&#39;t want to miss anything in case it flew back up again, which it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The number of fire balls increased then decreased but at the end it went from 5 at the most to more than we could count.  The large amount of fire balls were visible for att least 10 minutes so 40 minutes total, approximately.  When filming and photographing the balls they looked like blinking lights.  We were at least a 45 minute drive away from them but they were still very large and visible, we are about 3500 ft above sea level and they were still way above us.  I have numerous photos and three videos.<n>

I am staying near North Litchfield, at an oceanfront property.  Beginning at around 10p.m. EST, an orange &#34;Orb&#34; was seen in the NE sky over the ocean., and then disappeared.  It was joined by two other orbs, and they seemed to come into view and fade out, as a flare would.   After about 20 minutes of this, we witnessed two aircraft leaving the vicinity.   Another 20 minutes of no activity and the orbs begin again.   There were as many as 6 at times.  The orbs were in both the NE sky and also the SE sky.  After their &#34;glow&#34; show was over, we witnessed more of a sparkling light.<n>

The lights were about the size of two or three bright stars combined as seen from earth.  They would vary in number but always appear in a line if together.  Sometimes the line would move, tilt, or the lights would get bigger, as if the object(s) were moving closer.  At one point, three sets of lights could be seen in three different areas, as if there were three separate rotating objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then saw three white, smaller, blinking objects the size of stars that flashed rapidly in a series of three, that appeared in the direction of the previous phenomena and then moved quickly to the southwest in a line across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing appeared after this.  The same phenomena happened last night around the same time and lasted approximately the same duration.<n>

We had light cloud cover yet we were able to see the round fireball.  Had the fireball been higher in the sky I believe the fireball would have been more visible only as light coming through the clouds.  Yet, it was either below the cloud layer or just barely into it as we were able to see the glow and a small dot in the center.  It stayed stationary as we continued to watch.  As we watched in disbelief and were equally curious as to what this object was, it began to &#34;burn out&#34;.

All very silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Evening of June 26, 2014, when we walked onto the beach at 10:15pm, saw orange lights already there hovering in the sky over the ocean: two sets of three lights lined up close together in a small row, and then one off to the left by itself.  Very quiet. The one on the left seemed to sweep off to the left and disappear.  The other two just blinked off. As we continued to watch, the lights blinked off and on periodically, one light - not the row of three again.  We watched movement of other white lights around this area. Seemed very active, so fast it was sometimes hard to focus in.  Movement and directional shift faster than anything I&#39;ve ever seen. Sometimes almost too fast to see.  Sometimes a larger single flash of light, sometimes smaller ones grouped together.  At one point,we saw a pale chain of white lights move quickly in sync like a necklace.  In the end, saw two large white lights, one over the other, separated by a large space move slowly upward in the sk! y over our heads.  The lights were too far apart to be a plane-very far apart.  It seemed like they might be connected.  There were several of us on the beach together watching over the course of an hour.   One said they&#39;d been watching this for three nights and got some of the lights on video.<n>

They were flying next to each other so immediately I thought they were military aircraft in a training exercise.

They started moving away from each other, and then one disappeared, followed by the other disappearing about twenty seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, from the horizon, a similar light went up and disappeared, this time by itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next, two more lights came from the horizon, just like in the first description, and disappeared after parting ways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was a bit cloudy but not enough to block out stars, etc.  I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t a commercial aircraft because I saw commercial aircraft flying when I saw the lights.

At about 21:00 we stopped to observe the sky which had begun to clear… the weather had been hot and overcast…winds about 5 mph from the South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were standing against a railing, looking East out over the ocean when we observed a luminous object, 2 to 3 times the diameter of any of the few visible stars… the object did not appear to have any motion or direction, was at an estimated 35 degrees above the horizon and a fairly luminous yellow color.   The object “turned off” for about 20 seconds then back “on” for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This process repeated itself over a 10 minute period or so…… after that time it or a similar object appeared to the south west…using the Easter position as 12 o’clock, the newer object was now at about 1:30…. It also turned on and of during a few minutes period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 21:15 we both observed that the light reappeared near its original location but to our surprise a second light now came on to the left side of the first, slightly lower the it and then a third and so on until seven luminous objects were present in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The line descended downward from right to left at about a 10 degree angle with the spacing between objects equal to 4 or 5 diameters of a single object  The lights “came on” at about one second intervals and as the third object illuminated we both began counting aloud, fascinated by what we were observing. After observing the group of lighted objects for about 5 to 7 seconds, I turned and asked a couple sitting on one of the boardwalk benches behind us to turn around and verify our observations…. By the  time I was able to explain my request most of the objects were “off” but did come back ”on” individually.  The objects continued to cycle on and off for about 30 more seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued our observations for an additional 10 minutes or so but all the object had gone “out” and remained so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed no motion of any kind by the objects, no smoke trails as may be observed with flares, no sound… they appeared to be several miles distant but I had no means of determining that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record I complete one of these reports on the 19 of June for our observations on the 18 of June in Myrtle Beach SC…<n>

I had to see for myself and walked out on the Garden City pier around 10:00 PM.  Apparently the lights had been seen earlier according to other family members.  I watched for about an hour as multiple lights would flash on, then off.  Sometimes singly, other times three in a row followed by three in a row.  They did not appear to move and seemed to last about 5-10 seconds before going out.  What was interesting was that the intensity was the same no matter where the lights appeared.  Maybe flares?  But very symmetrical in nature and occurrence.  Odd for sure, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.<n>

The light moved across the skyline at extremely high speed, assuming the object was as distant as I think it was.  It was also incredibly smooth, gliding effortlessly north to south.  Every 8 seconds or so, the radiant blue light became an intense white light for about 1 second, and then became a dull red before becoming an intense blue again.  This happened probably 4 times before the object dipped below the some apartments to the east of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen something that I couldn&#39;t explain like this before and thought I should describe it.  My girlfriend also witnessed this UFO and agrees that it could not have been any aircraft the two of us are familiar with.  I couldn&#39;t really see a craft shape very well, but she feels that when it went from the white light, which was VERY bright like search lights, back to red and then blue, it kind of seemed like the object was rotating.  We opened our back door I couldn&#39;t hear any damn thing, but my girlfriend thinks she heard it whining, again unlike any aircraft we understand.<n>

Shortly after the sighting we went to report it and discovered the very recent other sightings of lights with the exact same description, many in Southern California.  First time is chance, second is a coincidence, but over 210 sightings is a pattern.  Weird.<n>

It became apparent after I stared at it for several seconds that it was hovering and moving gently to the left and the right.  I then thought it was some type of plane or helicopter but I heard no sounds of engines from a helicopter or plane.  It also seemed so high and far away because it was the size of the stars that were out in the sky.  Within the first minute of observing it moving back and forth from east to west the orange light broke away into three orange lights then took the form of an inverted triangle, with the original orb being at the base of the inverted triangle while two other orbs formed the top corners.  It appeared as a black triangular mass that was joined at the three corners by the orange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It briefly expanded and contracted and moved to the right fairly quickly and then just hovered remained stationary.  I then opened the door and yelled for my husband to come quick and tell me what he sees.  He ran to the kitchen window saw where I was describing and then the three orbs seemed to contract back into the original orb and it immediately shot straight up (quickly) and the event was over.  It only lasted for approximately 4-5 minutes.  I stood and observed the sky for about another five minutes and saw and heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Sometimes these lights were spread out and other times very very close and blinked in patterns.  I&#39;m aware that others noticed these lights as well and we&#39;re attempting to record them.  An aircraft took off from the nearby airport as the lights were still visible and flew directly into the area of them and then immediately returned to the airport.

The only difference is that this one was a bit more west of the first one. It behaved the same way as the first one by fading in and out at irregular intervals.  Then it flare up into a larger very noticeable light and then completely faded out of sight.  And then we saw a third one around five minutes later that behaved similar the first one, it did not flare up like the second one.  Then around 25-35 minutes later, we saw all three going back down south in a straight line, spaced apart similar to the! constellation orion.

This morning on KTLA (Los Angeles Station), they reported two lights in that same vicinity last night, and they were recorded once again.  The news anchor reports, Camp Pendleton Marine Base, Miramar Naval Base, (which are located in the Oceanside, San Diego area) and the FAA ,have put out a statement, they don’t know what these lights are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the MUFON California site, I clicked on Orange County, I checked it out last night, it goes to some other venue.

It was clear over the water the object was soundless and 300 ft in air flew towards me and then south then it quickly changed directions and zig zagged rapidly.  Then it flew slowly towards the north at about 20 mph then cut in towards the shore.  When it was over the first condo on the beach I thought to it, why are you not cloked they will see you?  I swear right after I thought that it disappeared into thin air.  There was no solid red or green lights on the object.<n>

Tokachidake (an active volcano in the northern part of Japan), which has been famous for UFO sightings for decades. You can see a bright object soaring up from the bottom right corner of the video screen, but in reality, my camera was facing the zenith, and the object was moving horizontally across the sky from the east to the south. I fixed my camera position and did not follow the object, so the zigzag motion of the object was not because of camera shake. I was the only one looking up the sky and other people (mountain climbers) were already sleeping in their tents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since the site was at an altitude of 1200 meters and the temperature was very low at night, there were no insects flying, and the fireflies (lightning bugs) do not exist in the area (the fireflies do not fly at such a high speed in the first place and my camera cannot catch such dim lights). The site was completely dark and there were no outdoor lights nearby (and it was a dark moonless night). I could see many stars in the sky with the naked eyes, but my small digital camera (CASIO EX-H10) could not catch any starlight. So you can guess how bright that object actually was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one and half hours before I saw UFO, I was surprised by a small mechanical sound that I heard from my left side (no more than two feet from where I was standing in the camping site), and I saw a long-haired young woman in white clothes. As I mentioned,the site was almost completely dark and I could not even see my shoes very well, so I could narrowly recognized that woman but could not see her face. Then I saw a small and round red light in front of her chest or her solar plexus. I supposed she would be fixing her camera to a tripod to take pictures of beautiful starry sky (but I did not actually see any camera or tripod) . That slender lady was about 5 feet and 7 inches tall and had black hair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I wondered why she was working in the darkness without any lights, I stepped back silently because she did not seem to have noticed that I was standing so close to her,and I did not want to surpise a young woman in the darkness. After that I kept standing for a while at some distance from her, but the next time I found that she was gone - disappeared without making any sounds of walking. In the camping site,I could hear footsteps very well even if they were more than 20 meters away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered where she had gone because I did not hear any sounds of car. It was too dangerous for anyone to leave the site on foot because there were wild bears often appear in that area. She was not looking up overhead but straight ahead to the east where the Tokachidake mountains rises-and it was the very direction where the UFO appeard about one and half hours later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although there is no certain links between that mysterious lady and the UFO, I have to say that I had seen another mysterious yong gentleman who suddenly disappeard before another UFO appeared in the sky when I was waiting for the chance to videotaple UFO on the beach of Kamakura on February 25 in 2014.  At that time,I saw a large disk-shaped green UFO that circled over my head and flew away.  I was so surprised to see the UFO at a such close range that I momentarily forgot about taking its picture even though I had my camra at hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having had such similar two experiences, I came to believe that the mysterious lady and the gentleman may have somthing to do with the UFOs that appeared after these mysterious people disappered.<n>

Object stationary for 15 seconds then began to rise as it moved slowly Eastward. This object was not an airplane.  It continued to move farther up into the sky and began to fade slowly.  The movement was not consistent with an orbiting satellite nor was it streaking like a meteorite.  The object continued to climb in a linear fashion and faded slowly out until no longer visible.  I was unable to grab my camera in time to take an image.  The speed and movement over the course of watching this object was very peculiar and not familiar.

We were driving eastbound on I-8 around Gila Bend, AZ when we noticed a single orange light to the south.  It appeared to be about 5-10 miles away and approx. 2-3000 feet up.  At times we could see the background of the mountains silhouetting from the orange glow of the light and it also appeared to have a smoke trail coming from the light.  The single light stayed up for a few minutes, then disappeared. within seconds, it reappeared, then a second orange light appeared at the same altitude. It also appeared to have a light smoke trail coming from it.  Then about 5 tracer lights shot from the second light and disappeared.  Then within  a few seconds another round of tracer lights appeared  but came the sky towards the light.  Then the two lights faded and a single light appeared and then  second light and then a third light.  Within a few minutes they all disappeared.  My nephew said he could make out a shadowy figure aroun! d the orange lights, but I was driving and wasn&#39;t able to stare at it long enough to make it out.  Observers were Me and my wife ages 53, my wife&#39;s sister and her son, ages 43 and 15.

I watch the sky every night - I can usually find Mars if it is visible, can identify numerous constellations, know the difference between a satellite and an airplane, and just love to stare out into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:17 PM, I was looking at the sky as I always do, but it wasn&#39;t a very clear night and very few stars were visible due to the massive light pollution created by the New York City lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of the corner of my eye I noticed an orange glowing orb of light.  After doing a quick double-take, I saw there were actually three orbs of light moving across the sky in a way I have NEVER seen any craft or airplane or satellite move - ever.  It was completely silent and seemed to float through the air.  I instantly knew I was seeing a UFO; I had absolutely no doubt in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the midst of my excitement/awe/disbelief, I grabbed my iPhone and tried to record as much as I could (I knew that if I didn&#39;t capture this experience no one would ever believe me).  The orbs of light moved across the sky and I took my first video but to the blind eye and without the technology needed to slow down the video, all I could see was the black night sky.  I had a feeling that nothing was on that video and quickly tried to take another one before it was too late.  Fortunately,  I was able to switch the camera on in time and record what I did.  For two weeks I didn&#39;t think I had captured anythng, until I decided to watch the videos on my computer.  There is not person who I&#39;ve showed this to who can come up with any plausible explanation for what I saw and recorded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three orbs of light were moving Northeast and started very low - pretty close to some of the taller buildings.  As it moved across the sky (in a pretty slow and stable pace) it began to rise in elevation before hovering for about 20 seconds almost directly above the building across the street from me.  As it hovered there the lights remained solid and then out of nowhere the 3 lights moved rapidly throughout that area of the sky - not side to side but in terms of elevation. It was hard to determine at first whether the three orbs were all one object or if they were in fact three seperate crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the orbs move as they did here, both in unison and independant paths, it was clear that this was one entity.

At the speed it was traveling, It was extremely quiet.  We grabbed the binoculars and It appeared to be an asteroid.  He noticed that the object (traveling from the west to the east ) suddenly turned south east direction.  There was no sound at all coming from the object.  The light very quickly grew dimmer and awe saw 3 aircraft behind the first object.  Two had flashing green and red lights and the other had amber lights flashing.  They appeared to be chasing the first object.  None of the aircrafts we witnessed produced any sounds.  The first lighted object was incredibly fast and was almost instantly (within 15 seconds) gone from view.<n>

I saw a bright light traveling north to south and it also traveled directly above me.  This sighting was for 4 minutes from 9:03-907 pm Sunday night on 22 June 2014.  I first noticed the bright light in the northern sky over La Mirada Regional Park.  It was bright and low. It flew directly overhead and continued towards Fullerton.  The light did not change in intensity as it was coming towards me or when it traveled away from me.  There were no flashing collision lights.  I was standing about one block south of the park.  I am guessing that around the border of La Mirada and Fullerton, less than a mile south of me, the brightly lite object slowly faded out.  For a few seconds, I could see the city lights reflect off the very dark, black object.  Just for a second I looked at the helicopter and when I tried to relocate the unlike black object, I could not find it.  This sighting was unusual in that there was a police helicopter! traveling with the UFO and at about the same speed.  The helicopter and the brightly lite object were only a few hundred feet apart.  The helicopter was not directly under it, but was slightly west of it.  After both objects passed me and were almost in Fullerton, the helicopter made a 90 degree turn to the east passing under the glowing object.  About 10 seconds later, the glowing object slowly faded out over a 4 or 5 second period of time.  That is when I could see the city lights reflect off the dark or black object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object looked to be about the same size as the helicopter, even though it was a little higher than the helicopter.  Of course I can&#39;t say whether the officer in the helicopter saw the glowing object, but it sure looked like the helicopter was following it.  I can&#39;t imagine that the officer did not see it, in fact, I had the impression he was following it.<n>

It was dark but we hadn&#39;t turned any lights on to avoid the June-bugs.  We were looking up because my uncle had an application on his phone that showed the various constellations.  Then, from one side of the sky I thought I saw movement, but it was hard to focus on what was going on (whatever it was blended perfectly with the light-polluted sky).  I pointed at it and told everyone to look. It flew directly over us.  No sound.  I wouldn&#39;t have been able to see it had it not been for the lights that appeared on the corners.  What was strange is that the lights appeared to be facing inward towards the center of the aircraft itself.  As it flew over I was become annoyed by the fact that nobody was saying anything, so I asked, &#34;Is anybody seeing this!?&#34;  Two of my cousins replied exuberantly, with a hint of horror (which I understand completely, because this was really a strangely terrifying experience).  It disappeared a few seconds later into the light pollution coming up off the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The people who saw it were myself (a 16 year old high school student), my cousin (an 18 year old who just graduated), my second-cousin (also a high school student), and another second-cousin (also a high school student).  Also present were our parents, and two other cousins, all of which did not see it themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.

It is roughly 2:30 to 3:00 am when SWIM Sometimes gets off of work for the night.  Stories like these are difficult to believe often simply because of lack of several witnesses.  Yes, SWIM was alone on the deck after a hard day of work, and often is tired and sore due to the tendencies SWIM&#39;s career entails; SWIM is smoking a cigarette, looking up at the sky from the deck with a perfect view of the stars. Crystal clear not a cloud in sight.  SWIM is no stranger to the sky or view of stars in array from the viewpoint of the deck.  SWIM lived in this house for +5 years and loves looking at the stars.  SWIM recalled seeing several shooting stars 4 to be exact that morning, and also 3 planes.  So if SWIM is a reliable source &#34;in your opinion&#34; it would be safe to assume he, or she knows the difference between planes, stars, and mystical aerodynamic flying saucers. There is a star with another star appearing to be underneathe the other from the east of this direction.  SWIM thought a light flashed from the general location in the sky.  SWIM recalled seeing these two stars light up and connect as if almost with a lighteningbolt connecting the two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the original activity, about 200-300 feet off the ground hovered a strange disk/saucer, there were no blinking lights and it appeared to have an ominous green/orange haze to it.

Unlike a plane it was off normal course of the areas normal flight passage and had no blinking lights.

I was in my back yard in Wayland, NY, just south of the Finger Lakes, Hemlock and Canandaigua Lakes specifically.  I noticed the fireball when it was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon.  It moved on what seemed to be a straight trajectory from the northeast to the southwest.  As the fireball moved to the southwest, it remained fairly regular in brightness and shape until it was past my location, when it dimmed until I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, it reappeared a bit smaller and less intense and then it appeared to “flash” as a silvery mark in the sky.  Eventually it moved far enough that I lost it against the ambient light nearer the southwest horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was very clear and the fireball was very bright compared to the stars in the sky tonight.  The fireball seemed to be exactly th! at, a fireball- its shape was not totally regular, it appeared to have actual flames, not just a glowing light.  It was much larger than any star or planet as seen with the naked eye but smaller than the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound that I could hear apart from any other noise this evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial reaction was to record the fireball with my phone.  The video does not show nearly the amount of detail or intensity that I was able to observe, but does provide an approximate record of how long it was visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second thought was that it was a sky lantern, but after just a few seconds it was evident that that it was too bright, moving too fast, and moving laterally instead of vertically.  I have spent too much time camping or at the lake to think this was a lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was clear that I wouldn’t be able to see the fireball again, I called NUFORC and filed this report.<n>

It looked like someone had shot off a firework but there was no noise and the object did not disappear/fade away like a normal firework does.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After realizing that it wasn&#39;t a firework I kinda assumed it was a flare of some sort due to the brightness of the object.  I quickly realized that it wasn&#39;t a flare when it the main object suddenly dropped mini &#34;flares&#34; of its own.  I immediately alerted my friends to get out of the car to see the object. It clearly wasn&#39;t a plane; no noise, no blinking red/white/green lights. This sighting lasted for about 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was orange/reddish in nature as like a ball of fire. It flickered  not like anything I had seen before. The object was circular in shape in the way of a fireball would assume.  The way it moved seemed like it as gliding across the sky by some alternative means. The object moved from the North to a Southern direction.  The height of the object didn&#39;t seem to high or low in the sky, relatively speaking.  Definitely at a planes altitude.  Hard to judge considering it was at night and nothing in the sky to reference to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only 1 main object (possible flares/objects being ejected from it that disappeared).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Planes fly over my house/the area all the time. I can tell when a plane is going overhead. I nor my friends that witnessed this as well do not have any aviation background.  However I would consider myself proficient at plane identification (civilian and military).<n>

City line is about 3 miles from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My home is about 300 yards from the Delaware river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed some very odd, orange, vaguely flickering lights, traveling roughly SE to NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They appeared to be between 500 to 1,000 feet above me moving at about the speed a small, single engine private airplane might be at cruise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They made no sound that I could hear, and that area is relatively quiet at that time on a Saturday night.  They were not equadistant from each other, and some would fall back, then catch up with the one in front again.  Gaps in the line of objects were not constant, and there were even some stragglers way in back of the main 7 or 8 objects.  I watched untill I could no longer see them because of the buildings and trees nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was very clear and cool, I would say near 70 degrees.  Maybe a light breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A man driving by had stopped to ask directions had also seen them, and remarked that they looked like &#34;Chinese lanterns.&#34;  I thought that these things appeared to be operated by something other than a candle and hot air.  They were acting like they were being piloted.<n>

Out of no wear, I herd a horrific sound coming from behind me.  I turned around a seen a huge ship moving very slow coming towards me.  I froze at first, it was in the shape of a triangle. I garbed my cell phone (Galexcy S5) and recorded a 45-second video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I lost site with it reviewed the video.  To my amazement it recorded first 3 sec and last 10 sec of video.  It had three white lights on each corner of the ship.  The only color of the ship was black and looked very smooth.  The size of it was….<n> <n><n> <n><n> Huge.  I don’t know how to put it size.  If I had to guess I would say 100-200 ft per side of triangle.

In this instance, the light behaved according to what appears to be normal, but after it faded to black, it reappeared, considerably brighter, and much further along in it&#39;s trek than it&#39;s speed while previously visible would have allowed.  It was almost as though it jumped across the sky, after which, it went b! ack to its predisposed M.O. and continued to the northeast.  I have been witnessing this phenomena for better than a decade, intermittently though it might be.  What was once merely the possibility that I was either crazy, or actually witnessing things that are exceedingly difficult to explain, is now somewhat substantiated, as I am no longer alone in my experience.<n>

At approximately 9:45 we noticed this bright o|6/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110507.html|267|ndxe201406| Four lights were observed over Minooka, IL exhibiting abnormal flight characteristics and lack of standard navigation illumination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From a patio in a suburban neighborhood, the primary witness observed a small, bright red light rising from the horizon in the WSW direction.  The direction corresponded approximately with that regularly observed for commercial airlines/cargo aircraft on approach to MDW or ORD.  The light approached from WSW, heading NE at an apparent velocity at least 4-5 times the apparent velocity of a typical commercial aircraft seen on approach from that direction.  At first, the primary witness considered that the light was a low aircraft without standard landing or navigational illumination.  There seemed to be a faint hiss from the light as it approached.  As it reached between 30 and 45 degrees in elevation above the horizon, the light instantly decreased in apparent velocity and changed heading N.  The light then continued on at the reduced velocity until it reached a position to the NW of the observation position (still at similar angle of elevation) and appeared ! to hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light began to hover, the witness observed two more identical lights in close formation with each other follow the same approach and pattern at similar velocity.  The faint hissing sound also seemed to emanate from these.  As the pair of lights approached the apparent waypoint for change to a N heading, the witness observed a commercial aircraft at typical approach altitude from the SSE, flying directly overhead, presumably on approach to MDW, and with standard landing and navigation lights.  This commercial aircraft should have had clear observation of the pair of lights, and likely the fourth light.  The dull roar of the commercial aircraft was clearly audible and was vastly different than the faint sound heard from the lights by the primary witness.  The witness also noticed that the first light had apparently disappeared as the pair of lights progressed along the same N heading.  As the pair of lights began to hover in the same NW location as the first light had, ! a fourth light appeared from the same location along the horizon, proceeded along the same route, and at similar velocity to the first three.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the primary witness called a second witness from the residence to confirm what was being observed.  The second witness observed the two lights in formation appear to hover in the same location that the primary witness had observed the first light hover.  The secondary witness did not observe the entire approach of the fourth light from the horizon, but did observe its change in heading to follow the pair of lights N.  Both observers witnessed the pair of lights either reduce in illumination, or proceed at increased velocity N, until they disappeared.  The secondary witness returned to the inside of the residence as the fourth light progressed along the path N.  The primary witness then observed the fourth light appear to hover in the same location as the first light and the pair of lights had hovered.  For 1-2 minutes, the light seemingly hovered in place, with slight random movement.  After hovering, the light began to diminish as the pair had, again either e! xtinguishing or moving off at rapid velocity directly away from the observer, to the N.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness also observed another, presumably commercial (based on apparent landing and navigation lights), aircraft in the distance.  This second commercial aircraft appeared in the NNW and appeared to be following an E heading, possibly on approach to ORD.  From the point of observation, this aircraft and the fourth light appeared to have intersecting paths.  As the fourth light faded from view completely, there was approximately 3-5 degrees of angle between it and the commercial aircraft, with the commercial aircraft still to the W of the fourth light.  For approximately 5 minutes following the event, the primary witness continued to scan for additional lights, but none appeared.  As the fourth light was moving off to the N, a third commercial aircraft appeared on the horizon from the same location as the four lights, to the WSW of the observation position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the closest approach (as each light changed heading N), the red lights appeared in size equal to landing lights on a commercial aircraft at standard to low approach.  The red lights did not blink and no strobe or steady lights of any color appeared to accompany the lights.  The intensities (though not the color) of the lights were similar to a commercial aircraft landing light on low approach and did not appreciably vary, except with distance as they approached from the WSW and appeared to depart to the N.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The primary witness wears prescription eyeglasses for distance correction and had them on for the entire event.  The secondary witness wears contact lenses for distance correction and had them in for the entire event.  The secondary witness did not indicate noticing the faint hissing sound with any of the lights that the primary witness heard.  Neither witness was under the influence of an intoxicant during the event.  Over the course of the event, the primary witness observed cloud-to-cloud lightning strokes at altitude far to the SSW.  The distance was great enough that thunder did not perceptibly report at the observation location from the strokes.  Fireworks had been launched in the vicinity of the observation location during the course of the evening, though the primary witness does not recall hearing the report of mortars at any time during the event and each of the lights lasted far longer than any pyrotechnic device the primary and secondary witnesses have previously! observed and did not wax or wane appreciably in intensity.  There is no doubt by the primary and secondary witnesses that the lights were some type of aircraft, and not a pyrotechnic effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In contrast to standard aircraft, the lights displayed the ability to move at high velocity and make rapid changes in velocity.  The ability to, apparently, hover is not common among fixed-wing aircraft, yet the apparent velocity seemed to the primary witness to be too great for a rotor aircraft.  If the lights were at low altitude (to explain the high velocity from the horizon), they did not emit a loud noise as would be expected from a rotor or fixed-wing aircraft.  The primary and secondary witnesses are familiar with military helicopters that operate periodically in the local airspace.  These aircraft (Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks) have always been readily audible both during the day and at night.  If the lights were aircraft with STOL/VTOL capabilities, they did not emit the expected sound of a jet turbine engine.<n>

I live in a city that is about 11 miles southeast of downtown L.A., on the edge of the San Gabriel Valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were 10 orange-yellow fireballs about the size, from my perspective, of a small fireball.  They appeared to be in a loose formation at about 3-4000 elevation.  Where I live, our house is under one of the direct flight paths to LAX so many commercial airlines are always over our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These &#34;fireballs&#34; had no discernible wings or other aviation lights on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four fireballs were leading the &#34;pack&#34; in a loose line and then the next four appeared to be in a square like formation with 2 fireballs trailing behind in a loose line.  They appeared to be traveling slowly and kinda lightly &#34;bobbing&#34; up ! and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knocked on my neighbor&#39;s house and he came out and witnessed the same thing.  The people across the street, who like to sit outside their house in the evening,also witnessed this.  One of the young men who was sitting outside had noticed it right away, but did not want to draw any attention to it for fear of being ridiculed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t until I and my neighbor were outside and talking excitedly, did we attract their attention.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone but I have a flip phone and didn&#39;t take it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the people across the street were unsuccessful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier in the week…on Thursday, June 19, this same type of fireball was reported on our local KCBS affliate here in Los Angeles.  Someone had captured it on the phone and sent it in.  This was in Orange county in the evening but instead of 10 fireballs, there were two fireballs which appeared to merge into one fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes the fireballs slowly &#34;went out&#34; or dark.  They were still there, I&#39;m sure, but they turned off the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The direc tion they appeared to be going was east towards the San Gabriel mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have reported this kinda of sighting before on this website about 2 years ago, and at about the same time of year- late June.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Video link:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/video/10285643-mysterious-lights-in-the-sky-spotted-above-oc-camp-pendleton/#.U6oGpLc8a_I.gmail<n> <n><n> <n><n> PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending you this video of &#34;lights&#34; that were seen over the Orange county  area near Camp Pendelton last Thursday (June 19).

If for some reason this link does not work go one their website and click on their video link.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending it because I believe it is directly linked to my sighting on June 21st in Pico Rivera.   Only instead of 2 fireballs (lights) I saw 10.  I did report this on your website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange as this sounds, I have been waiting for them to come back because I reported my &#34;first&#34; ufo sighting about 2 years ago on June 29.  Only then it was a huge fireball that &#34;slowly&#34; went out until it &#34;disappeared.&#34;   I had a &#34;feeling&#34; they would be &#34;back&#34; and about this time of year- late June.  Sure enough, here they are again only more numerous and in other locations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did call the local authorities (sheriffs) who told me to call the Air Force and the same KCBS station that had initially reported  the Orange county  lights but they could not do anything because I had no photos or video of it, the same with the local KNBC station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, you had to have video or photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again,  thanks for all your hard work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/video/10285643-mysterious-lights-in-the-sky-spotted-above-oc-camp-pendleton/#.U6oGpLc8a_I.gmail<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

The window faces north. I told my husband to follow me outside there’s a light in the sky, he followed and saw the light, quickly deciding it was a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran and got my camera, however being the evening the two short videos I shot I don’t think are very helpful.  The light moved fairly slowly, at one point seemed to hover for a few seconds, and move slightly up and then back to the original line of travel.  It wasn’t moving very quickly, so it seemed feasible that it may be a helicopter.  However I saw no red or green navigation lights, or strobe lights of any kind, which I have always associated with helicopters or airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen spotlights on helicopters and remember them being a very bright white…not this orange color.  I heard no sound that seemed to originate from it.  I thought I heard a helicopter but it was very faint and off to the west where there is a hospital with a helicopter pad here in town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was almost directly over the house and helicopters that have flown over us at that altitude in the past make a lot more noise than what I was hearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was solid orangish-yellow, with no blinking.  It was not perfectly round or orb like, it had a “flame like” appearance, similar to a hot air balloon flame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just under the cloud cover.  I went to a weather website after the sighting and it said there were a few clouds at 12, 000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My camera makes the light appear as an orb, but it wasn’t perfectly round.  Also, camera kept trying to auto-focus…I think the video is just useful to show there was some light in the sky. I will share my videos via e-mail if interested.<n>

There about only 300 yards away, and half a mile high was a circle shaped object.  It was lit up with lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to be moving about  40 - 50 miles per hour.  And about 80 yards in diameter.  It wasn&#39;t making a sound. I then realized the sound was coming from 1 or two jet fighter&#39;s.  I couldn&#39;t see the jets, but I came too this conclusion cause I&#39;ve heard fighter jets before.  And it sounded like as this object was kinda floating above the lake approximately 50 miles an hour the fighter jets were staying way above it circling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance it looked to be cigar shaped.  But I am sure it was round.  From the positioning of the lights. The lights were only one color.  Like if you had a dimmer switch and had all the lights turned down really low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it disappeared, like it shut its lights off.  But I could still hear the jets circling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am thinking it took 20 minutes to where I couldn&#39;t hear the jets anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS.  Although the jets were staying with this aircraft they were I am guessing keeping a 20 mile circle around it.  I swear by this statement.<n>

About half way down the object, it started to turn greenish, and turned solid green towards the bottom.  It was travelling about 200 miles per hour, and the light stayed within the object (rather than shining outside the object).

He and I are both 34 year old college educated males.  We both work nights (I&#39;ve been a full time firefighter EMT-B  for 7 years), so it&#39;s not unusual for us to go out in the CT river or on the Mattabasset all night and stay out sometimes into the next day until almost lunchtime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am (or was) a UFO skeptic.  Always have been.  He is a believer.  I usually roll my eyes and laugh at some of the things he&#39;s said he&#39;s seen in the past.  But this came out of nowhere.  We weren&#39;t looking for it.  We were trying to catch some bass.  No drinking or substances involved.  Just glad to be not at work with no obligations and fishing finally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We started the trip from the Portland Fairgrounds...  May or may not be entirely right to launch from where we did, but it was getting late and we wanted to get in.  Both of us have bright LED&#39;s that illuminate the surrounding water and trees.  We put the fishing off to head way down river (south).  I kept asking when we were going to be at this &#34;spot&#34; my friend had fished in the past.  Was a long trip down river.  Probably a few miles.  So when we saw what we both saw, we may have been near Portland, Cromwell, Rocky hill, Wethersfield, Glastonbury...  I&#39;m not 100% sure.  But local fisherman have nicknamed the spot &#34;the peninsula&#34;.  It&#39;s an island in the middle of the river near &#34;Perzold&#39;s Marine/Marina&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were heading to the back side the peninsula (downstream). Still in the middle of the CT river, We both saw something in the sky to the East.  It was bright white, big, crescent shaped, appeared suddenly and went down diagonally and to our left, moving very fast, until it disappeared behind the tree line.  We both said &#34;Whoa!&#34;  At the same time. We talked about it afterwards and I kept thinking of things it could&#39;ve been but they all turned out to be impossible.  Closest I could think of would&#39;ve been a comet or shooting star... But this was too big, too white, no tail, &amp; too fast.  It happened very quickly and was gone. So we kept moving.  Our moment of wonder was soon replaced by the fact that we were at the peninsula and it was time to fish now.  My friend went to shore and started a fire on the beach area.  I kept paddling and casting near the shore for a bit before heading over.  I got out and we got a small fire going.  (Fire ordinances don&#39;t apply if you&#39;re in the middle of the river just before sunrise and don&#39;t know exactly what town you&#39;re technically in... right? Lol)...  Then it got wierd enough to remember for a long time and even report on here (I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this btw.)...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing by the fire.  For some reason I got the urge to look back over my right shoulder and up at the sky...  Why?  Because something was there.  That&#39;s the only reason I can think of why I&#39;d look. I had already forgotten about the other event.  I looked up and saw a strange light moving a great distance at a medium pace, steadily in a straight line towards us across the sky (was heading west toward the Wethersfield side of the river.)  Things then escalated to wierd level 2: the thing had one bright light.  And as it got closer to being over head the light got dimmer and dimmer until it vanished completely. No clouds. Perfectly clear, still dark, just before dawn. It was gone. I turned my head back to my friend who was over on the left casting his line into the water. I quickly told him what I just saw and how wierd it was. He turned to look at me as I was talking. I looked up at the sky again and what we saw next made us both yell out profanities at exactly the ! same time. Diagonally In front of us, slightly northwest but just overhead, something shot across the sky faster than anything man made can move and in a way that stars, comets, or anything like that can move. This display, to me had &#34;technologically advanced machine&#34; written all over it. It made a line in the sky visible for less than a second. It was bright white and shaped like an archer&#39;s bow. Fast as hell and bright white. But this time, it didn&#39;t disappear afterwards. It looked as if it went hundreds of miles in a second to the north, and then stopped and hovered just above the tree line. And as it hovered it turned towrard us. And then it was possible to see more of its shape. It wobbled like a saucer as it turned toward us and then sat in a fixed position &#34;watching us&#34; as we fished. The front view it allowed us showed a multicolored string of lights around its cylindrical, saucer shaped perimeter. It say there for a while in the sky just before s! unrise, almost as if it was waiting for us to come to terms wi! th what we both saw, talk about it, and get comfortable with it to the point that we could just fish, know it&#39;s there, talk about it, and move on... Which is what we did basically. I&#39;ve texted and talked about it with him in person since it happened just to verify the reality of it. I was completely blown away. There was no way I could dispute this or write it off as something else. He&#39;s happy because he &#34;won&#34;, in that sense. But all I can think about now is wanting to see more. And I feel like a gift of knowing there&#39;s some other beings up there has been given to me. Pretty awesome. Next trip, I&#39;ll have my iPhone ready to take pics instead of tucked away in the watertight box I keep it in. Have even thought about getting a telescope. I&#39;m amazed. That&#39;s all I can say. Thanks.<n>

I had gone outside several times in the last 2 hours beforehand, but this time I chose to get a flash light and check it out.  I went to the rear left side of my home where I could see my dog was acting very strange, because he was obsessed with a frog that he could not reach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began noticing a mechanical sound, I have a pool and was standing next to the filtration system so at first I did not realize it was anything irregular.  It was at that time when I noticed the sound was different so I looked up and I could see an object in the sky  appeared to be hovering above my neighbors home that lives across the street from the front of my home. It was not fuzzy at all, it was as clear as it can get it was; a bright sphere or saucer shaped object that had two distinct lights that were red and green.  It was hovering for what I would say was 2 minutes when I realized that I needed to run insid! e and get my phone to try and capture an image.  I then ran inside and grabbed my I phone and placed it on camera mode and I tried to take a photo several times, but the phone stinks and it just was not looking good, so I took my flashlight and tried shining it toward the UFO so I could get a better picture, but it didn&#39;t work.  It was like I drew the objects attention when I flashed the light it finally moved toward the back of my yard directly over me, but 2 homes over the right from my front yard.  I switched my phone to video, because it began to fly around doing very fast change of direction movements, which I was able to take several videos showing the object moving. I felt as if it wanted me to see the object, then it shot back to the front. I have a wife and a 11 month old girl and they were in bed sleeping. I ran upstairs, because I knew someone else had to see the object or I would regret it. I woke my wife and she was startled so it woke up our baby (that was not gr! eat), but I had to do it. My wife was not happy, but I told he! re what I had seen and to run outside to see it. She went to try and see it from the windows, because she was indisposed, but could not see it, so I reiterated you have to see this, go outside. The baby began crying so I grabbed her and we went outside to the front porch to try and find it, but we did not have to search, it was hovering very low in front of our home this time and we stared at the object while I held the baby, they went back inside to go back to sleep and I ran back up to the bedroom to get the phone so I could get a shot of the object from my daughters room, since it was now so low and being upstairs I could get closer. I still had the phone on video so I began to film instead and I am glad I did, because as soon as I started again, a few seconds later it just vanished before my eyes.  It felt as if it knew we were observing it and helped us see it and then it vanished so I had no way of doubting what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I am a Navy veteran and a Minister in a Church, I have never believed in anything like aliens or UFOs, so this experience is definitely, not being written lightly. I am hoping that someone else saw what we experienced last night and that I could have someone analyze the phone footage to verify the proof.  I am so glad I woke up my wife and anyone who has a 11 month old baby that does not sleep or has been there knows, that waking them up was not done lightly,  My wife told me she was very glad I did this morning, because she would have believed me, but seeing it as clearly as she did, that was clearly unexplainable and obviously not easily mistakable for anything that we know exists.  I am hoping it comes back and I will be keeping my eye out for it tonight and whenever I can.  I will also note that around 2 AM I heard helicopters flying around my home later, this made me wonder if it had been reported.<n>

It came close to being overhead and started turning toward West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it turned, the large red light slowly disappeared, making it apparent that it was only pointing forward from the object.  The object seemed to be on a circular path. In about ten minutes the same object appeared in the same spot in the sky and flying the same path as the first time only this time staying little further North.  This happened two more times.  This red light was never blinking or changing in any way except for the disappearance.  To all of us watching it seemed that the object was moving in a slightly fluctuating speed although keeping a steady path.  The overall speed was that of a helicopter. It was a clear night and the camp was a quiet place, yet none of us could hear any sound.<n>

I took some photographs, which I will submit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This view also encompasses the takeoff/landing path for Reagan National airport in Alexandria, VA, but I have been watching the planes come and go for a couple of years, and have never ever seen something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights in the formation moved in inconsistent ways.  Some moving up and down some left (south) some right (north).  I went out to the street and could see them there as well.  I went in to get something to eat and when I returned they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also to note, the lights were orange, not yellow or white.

One only of these thunderheads, at about 340 degrees, was lit with a particularly brilliant sequence of lightning bolts, coming repeatedly every few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it, I saw a plane (with its anticollision lights blinking) pass below between the thunderclouds and myself.  And then, high up, seemingly at or a little above the tops of the thunderheads,  I saw a white light moving towards the northeast.  I thought it might be a satellite or very high jet, but then the single light resolved into three separate white lights, in a tight triangular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then slowed, reversed direction, then slowed, proceeded northeast again and went behind another high cloud.  I waited for it to reappear on the far side of the cloud, bu! t it never did so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object(s) must have been at a very high altitude, and it occurred to me that to see the three lights distinctly separate at such height must indicate large size.<n>

It didn&#39;t fly straight enough and I have to assume it was traveling too fast to be a satellite (how high it was and how quick it went across sky was way too quick considering every inch it traveled was probably a ridiculous amount of miles.  Made planes look like slow pokes) I followed until it disappeared, which means it zipped off or went too high in altitude, as the sky was very clear no clouds.

Occasionally, one of the circular lights would disappear as if it was being dimmed out (as if someone was dimming a light in a house).  This event  lasted for what seemed 10-15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking into my kitchen to get a drink of water when I noticed two orange lights in the sky through my sliding glass door (leading into my backyard) that overlooks the city I live in. I was facing south while viewing these lights and what made them so interesting to me was they were not moving, completely stationary the entire time the event occurred.  Initially, there were two orange lights and after a couple minutes one would fade out (again, as if being dimmed out).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute, the light that originally faded out would reappear then the other light would fade out just like the first one did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The process of one of lights fading out and the other light reappearing happened three times.  Each time the light wou! ld come back it would appear in the same spot that it was in before.  This did not happen simultaneously, when the light would come back the other would stay from anywhere to 5-10 seconds before it would fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What also made this interesting to me was that it occurred near an air force base in my city.  My house is located in a bit of a higher elevation from the rest of the city which gives me a panoramic view of the entire city and is roughly 10 miles from the air force base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These orange circular lights were not parallel or perpendicular to one another (making me believe they were two separate objects) and one was always sitting a little higher than the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the event ended, there was just a single orange circular light in the sky and it faded out just like it had been doing the previous times.<n>

I see you noted it on your front page.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I found tonight, when signing into Google, I typed in Mysterious lights over Orange Co, Ca, June 18, 2014, immediately, video evidence popped up.  If you go to the second entry,  a couple heading from Irvine, California (Orange County) south towards Dana Point, California, video taped the objects, even one going out, and then coming back on.  For your reference, it  says uploaded by Justin Me., and there is a reference to utube at the top of his entry.  You can hear both the husband and the wife, as they are video taping this phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was not only reported to your site, but hundreds of calls were received by many television stations from people describing the same thing.  There has been no explanation by anyone of authority over the past 6 days.  Initially, Camp Pendleton Marine Base in Oceanside, California, and the FAA said they had no craft in the air at that time, and did not know what it was that people were viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have you received any more information from your sources?  Several eyewitnesses reported to news stations, helicopters were seen trying to chase these lights in the sky, with their searchlight pointed up instead of towards the ground as we are used to seeing, when a search is occurring.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you get a chance to view the video I referred to you , you will be amazed.  And that is not the only video that has been shown by local television stations.  This is not a hoax.

I signaled it with my headlights. I pulled over to view it and kept following it as far as I could, until it passed over the hills and was out of sight.

It was a distant dim white light flying SE to NW, but was definitely not an airplane whereas I view airplanes frequently in the night sky and am familiar with their lights (most airplanes have white lights on the wings, a red and/or blue light in the front, and a strobe light with a very specific frequency).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not think it was a comet because it was moving too fast across the field of vision, in line with the speed of most airplanes and it did not have a tail.  It was not a firefly because it did not flash.  It was not a star, also because it was moving too fast across the field of vision.  I also can rule out the possibility of a meteor, because it was a dim whereas I have seen &#34;shooting stars&#34; and they generally are bright white and flash somewhat quickly across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was much dimmer, but still quite visible and moving quite quick! ly AND I was so certain about what I was seeing that I immediately came inside to find out what time it was.  It could have been a satellite, but it seems that satellites should remain stationary above the Earth&#39;s surface to serve their purpose for communication, so I would call it a UFO; very specifically an Unidentified Flying Object, because I could not identify it and because it was &#34;flying,&#34; but I can not call it a &#34;craft.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personally, I have looked for UFOs as sort of a &#34;joke&#34; to myself before because I have believed for some time that extraterrestrial life is quite possible (for 3 or 4 years in earnest).  Since I have become unemployed, I walk frequently on a rural but what I consider to be safe dead end street.  There are few obstructing lights, so I can often see the sky fairly well.  Once or twice last year, I made a game of leaving Tic Tacs on the street &#34;as a gift&#34; so that I could return to see if they were still there.  I am a strong believer in evolution and I was an Engineering major for a while during college and had Astronomy in college and retain the textbook for reference.  Because I have a sense of evolution and evolutionary time, especially now that I am mostly absent from the alarm clock world, dinosaurs and ice ages seem to fit for me.  I have read most of the Bible and interpret Genesis and the story of Creation to be not contrary to evolutionary findings, but rather a poetic message from peoples of the past that they had observed that humanity was the most intelligent form of life, and, therefore, LAST on the evolutionary timeline.  As for God, I believe God is not to be argued about, but that does not mean that the writers of the Bible had considered other worlds - although I do know that the Torah mentions other worlds.  Also, I am familiar with the local night sky and can identify Venus, Mars, the Moon phases, and several constellations and am able to connect their movements in the sky with the Earth&#39;s movement around the sun.  Basically, unles! s this was a satellite, I think the movement was too regular to have been anything else, although it could have been an Earth aircraft with which I am unfamiliar although it appeared much higher and faster in comparison.<n>

The second orange in color orb hovered for a bit and then as fast as it appeared it disappeared! I have never seen anything like it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After both orbs disappeared I heard and saw a military helicopter the helicopter was loud and gray in color and had no lights on it.<n>

The object continued moving in a northward direction and then seemed to stop for a moment then turn eastward over the ocean.  By this time it was no longer a ball of fire but more of a glowing ember.  I had enough time to run in and grab my video camera but by the time I got back on the beach it had started disappearing.<n>

When in front of me was a section in the sky that looked like lights blinking on and off directly out over the ocean.  These lights were white lights. There were at least fifteen of them in a large group.  I knocked on the door and let the others in the room know what was going on.  They came out and saw the event as well.  Then within the swarm as I’m going to call it, came these red circular lights that seemed to skip across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The swarm moved slowly up the beach over about a 5 minute interval.  Then started moving back down the beach over another 5 minute interval or so.  Then as a plane was flying down the coastline above.  It moved out to sea, then it moved down the beach and out of our sight. It blinked with those red circles at least fifteen to twenty times over the whole event which lasted at least 25 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked out on the beach near the end of the event and another guy asked if I saw the ufo.

No alcoholic beverage of any kind had been consumed by me or my wife before, during or after the evening’s event.  Having recently completed re-reading “The Electric Sky” by Donald  Scott and now with but four (4) pages left to finish reading “The Electric Universe” by Wallace Thornhill and David Talbott, viewing the stars is now done with an entirely new sense of wonder.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From our location the fireworks would be “fired” off from the end of a pier about 1/3 of a mile distance South East of us.  At about 21:40, I turned to view the scenery including the “Ferris” wheel slightly North West of our location when I observed several more stars that had come into view as the skys cleared even further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These stars appeared at about a 30 degree elevation form us …. As I watched several more stars appeared, four or five, and to my surprise they began “going off and on at about one second intervals, not necessarily in snyc with one another”… I then brought them to my wife’s attention who also observed this behavior. After a total of about four minutes the “flashing” stars went “out” and were not observed by us again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At least four of the stars were in a cross formation though wider in the middle. I later judged the horizontal distant between the stars to be about 2/3 across the width of one of my eyeglass lenses….. and the vertical ones about ½ the height of the lens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to locate the far left horizontal stars position  by trying to picture where it was relative to the shore and  perceived it to be almost directly above the junction of the beach and ocean…..the two vertical stars were mid point between the horizontal ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I had no accurate means or expectation of any need to perform such a task.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to observe the general location, two luminous circles appeared due East of us over the water. Their diameter seemed to be of 4 or 5 times larger than a star visible immediately to their right side and slightly above them. They had a reddish circumference with a yellowish center, did not appear to be moving and after about 30 seconds just “went out”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the two lights went out, I inquired of a couple sitting behind us to find out if they were aware of any of these sightings…… They were facing South and did not observer any of the items mentioned until now but as we talked one of the Red/Yellow circles reappeared in the same location for about 10 seconds the again went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The woman sitting there observed this event but had no knowledge of what it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Helicopter rides are a continuous sigh here but though I don’t know if there available at night, the proximity of the objects to one another , the lack of discernable motion and them both appearing then disappearing together make that very unlikely. We did observe two air craft. One was a single propeller type circling over the general area of the fireworks pier a few minutes before the actual display and the other that appeared more like the ISS ( space station) moving North to South, very reflective but as it passes well overhead appeared to have a blinking light. I had observed the ISS before and am aware that there is a web sight dedicated to locating it in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing further was observed regarding the stars or circles of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personal background:  Recentely retired; Married 46 years; US Navy Nuclear power trained electrician (6 years active duty Polaris Submarines); Former volunteer firefighter; EMT; Certified Fire Investigator (10 years service); Interest include Astronomy, Earth Science, Geology, Ancient Histories, Cannons (Civil War Re-enactor), etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is a retire registered nurse, we have 3 children, 5 grandchildren, a son in the National Guard who is a combat vet who served in Afghanistan.<n>

I looked out the window and saw a bright orange light in the sky, which at first glance I assumed to be the moonrise, a bit south of east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized the light wasn&#39;t as large as the moon.  I then thought I was looking at a plane flying in my direction, since it appeared not to move.  But it was a single large orange light, not the multiple white and/or red lights of a plane.  After about a minute of bright stillness, it seemed to collapse in on itself and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was odd, but I thought maybe it was a weird reflection, or projection or a helicopter.  I dismissed it and fell asleep.  I&#39;m an artist, with a vivid imagination, and so didn&#39;t take the sighting seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 1030 pm, I woke up and looked out the window.  To my surprise, the same light was there again.  My husband walked into the room and I asked him to verify what I was seeing.  He agreed that it looked like an incredibly bright, fiery, unmoving orange ball and was nothing he&#39;d seen before.  A software engineer by trade, he is also unrelentingly logical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched, another orange light appeared to the north of the first.  A few seconds later, the first light went out.  I got up and got my binoculars and looked at the object.  I couldn&#39;t see much detail--it was a large ball of fire, unmoving, with smoke trails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband looked through the binoculars and saw the same thing--an unmoving fiery ball with smoke trails.  He took a video with his iPhone, showing one light going out after another has appeared, but the video doesn&#39;t portray well the size, brightness or orange color of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third light appeared further to the north and the second light went out.  When the third light went out, no other lights appeared and we went to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a military base about forty miles to the southeast of us, so our assumption is that it is unknown military tech, but we have no expertise in this regard.<n>

I was watching for more of the same lights I had seen the night before and sure enough I began to see rapidly-blinking white lights and orange orbs.  The white lights were moving erratically and seemed to be chasing each other.  Then one or two large orange lights would appear and then fade away.  The lights were all within 30-40 degrees of the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching these lights, the next-door neighbor blinded my view with his flood light.  As I looked to see what he was doing, he turned it back off and as I turned back toward the ocean I saw a large white light hovering down the beach from me.  It seemed to be hovering over the Ocean Crest Pier and the light was just as large and bright as the lights on the pier.  I got my binoculars and looked and all I could see was a large, bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the white light seemed to fade away and a small red light appeared and began to move south toward the end of the pier.  Then the red light faded away and the large white light appeared again and seemed to just be hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple minutes I could see that the light had begun to move toward me and there appeared to be a red light on the right and a green light on the left.  None of these lights were blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By then my mother in law had come outside and watched with me as it glided directly over us.  It barely made any sound, only a quiet hum.  It was moving somewhat slow and was probably only a few hundred feet in the air.  It was headed toward the northeast. At the back of the craft was a fourth light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one was large and the same orange color as the orbs I had seen earlier over the ocean.

We were facing east.  We were fishing at night for catfish.  There were dozens of fireflies present, and there was lightning off in the distance to the west, north, and south as a storm was approaching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the south about 20 yards away and about 10 yards off the ground, a flashing light caught my attention.  At first I thought it was a firefly, but it could not have been.  It traveled off the water towards shore from east to west in a very straight line.  The line appeared to be perfectly parallel to the ground.  I think it flashed 4 times in the 3-5 seconds I saw it.  I estimate the speed at about 40 miles per hour, way too fast for a firefly.  It looked like it was shot out of a slingshot.  It looked like it was only about the size of a dime.  It was much brighter than a firefly, and the flashes were very consistent.  They went from dark to light almost immediately, like it was on a switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to my fishing partner “tell me you saw that” and he said “yes, I did.”  He agreed it was too big, too fast, and too bright to be a firefly.  There were many fireflies in the area so we had them to compare.  It also seemed to appear out of nowhere and then disappear just as fast after just a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a cell phone with a camera on me, but it disappeared before I could film it.<n>

I finally yelled to my wife to come downstairs from our bedroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she was coming down she slipped and I ran in to help her.  When we got outside the shape was gone.  This took place in all about 20-25 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood outside for a moment when my wife asked me if it &#34;looked like that?&#34;  She pointed up and there was a bright light very high fade in and out.

At first perhaps at a 45 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then that changed and it clearly was going up straight, steady and not too fast but it was getting dimmer and dimmer and obviously ascending straight into the atmosphere.  And, progressively dimmer and dimmer until it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t shoot straight up like a dart; it took about 15 to 20 seconds to disappear.  The dot of light easily seen getting dimmer and dimmer, and then just not there anymore.<n>

It looked light lightning lighting up the sky but there was no thunder that followed.  It did rain within the next 30 minutes so I&#39;ve dismissed it since as being heat lightning since that&#39;s what it looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a raised berm in my backyard which is lined with trees and evergreens, with a solid wooden fence behind it so my yard is very dark at night.  I saw a solid white light that could be mistaken for a flashlight but I would say it was larger than that.  If you put your hands together and make a circle with your thumbs and fingers touching, that is about the size it appeared to be.  At first I thought someone may have been walking around my yard - My husband and I were just commenting about the neighbors installing a fence and now so there is no way to get into our yard except from the front of the house or through a neighbors yard so it&#39;s pretty private now.  So I thought it was a flashlight, but it didn&#39;t move like someone was walking with it.  It would appear and disappear, and then reappear many feet away.  I thought it was strange but maybe still explainable.  But then the light would appear at the top of the trees.  That is 25+ feet in the air so it couldn&#39;t be a person holding a flashlight.  And it wasn&#39;t like a flashlight was throwing light from place to place, because it was a very bright white light, like it was the source of the light and not from a beam of light.  I watched for at least 5 minutes seeing the light appear and disappear throughout the treeline in my yard - for example it would appear close to the ground on the left and would shine for a few seconds, then the light would disappear and then 10 seconds later would appear to the right near the top of the trees 20 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes or so I saw a light light up the right side of my yard - like someone drove up my driveway and the headlights were shining light into my yard.  I didn&#39;t hear anything though.  It was a steady light and then eventually disappeared.  Sometimes police will drive through the neighborhood, but the headlights wouldn&#39;t have been shining in my yard (FYI, my room faces the back of the house and I couldn&#39;t see the driveway).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe it was police?  Maybe something was going on and they were looking for someone/something?  I live in a pretty boring area and not much happens here at night though.  I can try explaining away everything, but not the bright round white lights that kept appearing and disappearing and appearing again in a new location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me know if you would like any additional information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

Then I looked to the left of the middle cluster and noticed light blue tiny lights, the top 2 we solid whete there was 2 more below it which sporadicly blunk very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was pointing out some other odd looking lights to him, when we looked back and there was about 20 more lights that just appeared all around.

Live in a rural area in the woods.  Walking back toward the house I noticed a movement in the sky above the tree tops &amp; the roof, moving east to west.  Very much exactly east to west.  My initial glance looked like a red/orange ball moving steadily but tree tops made viewing somewhat unclear.  I backed back down the driveway (it is on a hill), to get a better view.  Realized it was nothing familiar so ran into the house and told my sister to get onto the deck quickly to see this thing.  She has good distance vision, I am near sighted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We moved to the deck on the lake side of the house where we could still see it as it moved away from us to the west over the lake.  My sister immediately said that it was triangular and that the orange lights almost looked like fluorescent tube lights around the edges.  It just continued moving at the same pace and with the same trajectory.  Not a sound was heard and it was a quiet, still night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have tried to estimate the altitude of whatever it was and can only say with certainty that it was low enough for her to be able to see some detail, no where near the altitude of the typical jets we occasionally see overhead.  It was in no danger of hitting tree tops or even cell towers but still close enough to see well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have not heard of anyone else reporting this object however, I know people are outside @ night and I am certain that other people would have seen it.  The thing was very bright orange and looked very large going across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not take the time to find cameras.  It all happened so fast and we didn&#39;t want to forego seeing the object in order to find electronics.  Just wasn&#39;t prepared @ the time.  Lesson learned.....<n>

Shortly before disappearing out of sight, another came over at the same speed but larger or at a lower altitude.  It cruised over in the same direction and eventually disappeared as well.  All objects were riddish orange amd had no flashing lights or trails.  We also noticed no noise coming from the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m always watching the sky and have seen all kinds of aircraft and even some satelites.  These seemed a bit unique so I dicided to report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for any info on these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of two reports from the same source.  The source does not indicate a date for this sighting.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yeah no hoax here.  I mean, I&#39;m only telling exactly what I saw.  I&#39;m just not sure exactly what they were.  Both sightings were weird in their own ways.  The first ones were traveling in somewhat straight lines but if you looked hard, you could see them almost zig zag.  Looking like a short wave medium frequency if it had left a trail.  If that makes sense.  The second night was really strange cuz the first sighting was still sorta fresh in our minds.  It was only two of us the second time tho.  Same colors, no zig zag, similar shape, much lower alt.  The second time you could really see that they were like small glowing  boomerangs...  Haha.  I hate explaining it like that cuz it sounds crazy.   I watch all the ufo documentaries and I sound like those folks now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m just looking for an explanation I guess.  I&#39;ve always been in the middle when it comes to this stuff.  Because I know people lie, exaggerate, halucinate...  But after I saw the lights holding a formation and then the forth one come over even lower, we were just playing it off like they were low level meteors or something....  flying in formation.... yeah.  Meteors fly in formation right?  Haha.  Anyway, I&#39;m not making it up, and I have no reason to pull some hoax.  I&#39;ll even be anonymous if I have to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time and any info you can send.  I can better narrow down the time as well if that helps.

It was silent and slowed to a stop a few degrees southeast of the field I was in and appeared to drift rapidly from side to side, speed up, and slow down moving rapidly in different directions at a very high altitude.  It continued moving from east to west in an erratic manner far above the clouds with no jet trails or sound.  The object would appear to stop and then dart rapidly as it were moving very fast but over a very small arc less than a tenth of a degree.  It gradually seemed to drift south of me from east to west but approached the area I was in more rapidly slowing almost to a stop.  It was partly cloudy and there were no stars in the sky.  The sun had set half an hour before. It was around 9:45 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point it was moving so slowly I thought it might be moving in the opposite direction it came but there was definitely a subtle and rapid darting from side to side.  I noticed nothing else in the sky that seemed to reflect or emit light at the time.  The dot may have had a slightly yellowish tint.  What was unusual was that it seemed to approach the field I was in very rapidly as though it were a plane traveling in one direction and once it were about three or four degrees southeast of me it stopped and drifted very slowly darting around erratically but subtly.  I got tired of watching it as it moved slowly south and west from me continuing the erratic darting and slowing as it were not moving quickly enough across the sky for me to watch it go to the horizon.  I could not identify the object.  It could have been a satellite or space station or something not extraterrestrial, but what was unusual was that it had slowed and stopped a few degrees from where I was and darted around.<n>

I started to see something fairly odd in the clouds, it was as if something was in front of the clouds.  I kept staring in the same place and it seemed as if something oval was moving steadily away.  The most craziest part is that it was like a chameleon.  A way to explain it in one word is that the craft was invisible.  It took the color of the clouds and everything around it and if you stared hard you can see that something is off from the area it was in then eventually making out the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shouted out to my dad &#34;A UFO!

Above the house we spotted what looked like a VERY large bird hovering over his house.  It appeared to be roughly 100 meters up, based on comparisons to surrounding trees, and if that estimate was accurate I would guess that this bird had to have had a wingspan equivalent to a small single engine plane.  What was very odd was the way it flew, hovering, very small wing movements at the very tips, and when it did fly away it basically headed directly east and at a very high rate of speed.  There were 4 witnesses total for that sighting.  My dad mentioned he had seen something similar where he works, only when he spotted it previously it spiraled straight up until it was out of sight.  Apparently there have been other sightings of this thing in the area as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I was laying out in my yard and I spotted the same thing, looked like it was flying at about the same height, very slowly passing from W/SW to the East.  I had my son run and grab my binoculars so I could get a better look at it.  I have good quality Bushnell binoculars and I was able to track it pretty easily.  Again, I am guessing it was roughly 100 meters in the air, same relative size, based on observation of the large trees we have around here.  With my binoculars focused I got a pretty good look at it, and it was not a bird.  This object had wings similar to a bird&#39;s, but again only moved the tips and very rarely.  It&#39;s midsection was cigar shaped, very pointed both front and rear.  We have large cranes and large ravens in the area, but ravens have a fanned tail when they ride thermals and cranes trail their legs.  This was completely symmetrical, no trialing legs and no fanned tail.  By my guess, based on the time of day and relative heat and wind, it pro! bably was not actually riding thermals either, it would have been too high up.  My son and I watched it for about 3-5 minutes as it passed over.  What was very odd is that it sped up dramatically once I but the binoculars on it, almost like it &#34;knew&#34; it was being watched.  It disappeared to the east fairly quickly.  Of note, the animals in the area (dogs, horses, goats, etc.) all seemed very perturbed when this was in the air...making lots of noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been watching since then to see if I can spot it again and I have asked around locally and I can account at least 10 other people who have either seen the same object, or something almost exactly the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of interest too, when time permits my wife and I spend a lot of time stargazing, and we have also seen repeated appearances of unexplainable bright white lights that tend to travel southwest to northeast, we have reported this before and we have had numerous witnesses with us when we spot these things.  On the Saturday evening before I spotted the bird we were out stargazing and watched what appeared at first to be a satellite pass over to the west of us slightly, moving from due north towards the south.  However, roughly 20 seconds after we spotted it the object &#34;split&#34;...as in, there was a bright flash, and then there were suddenly two objects..one moving south at a much more rapid speed, and a brighter object moving north at a rapid speed.  Both grew very bright after the flash and faded out.  Logically, I suppose it could have been a meteor or space debris breaking up at re-entry but I have witnessed both of those types of things numerous times and the way this! object acted was quite different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have also witnessed numerous other odd lights, mostly they seem to appear above the mountains to the north...they hover a bit, then zigzag around rapidly, sometimes they descend with a motion that is like a falling leaf, sometimes they shoot straight upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an interest in ufology and have read numerous books on the subject, and what concerns me is that we have a personal set of sightings spanning over two years in the same area with multiple witnesses.  Now, we are seeing a large &#34;bird-like&#34; object and the sightings continue.  Every time we witness something like this we note the behavior of the animals in the area, most times they are very obviously disturbed.  We have had instances of power anomalies in the neighborhood, and at times there have been areas around here that seem to emit a pervasive feeling of fear for no reason...all of this is strikingly similar to events reported by people in West Virginia in the Ohio River Valley in the 60&#39;s, as documented in several books but most notably John Keel&#39;s &#34;The Mothman Prophecies&#34;.  The events there culminated in the collapse of the Silver Bridge in 1967.  So many of the things we have seen parallel the reports in that book that it is hard to believe it! is simply coincidence.  Bearing logical explanations in mind (the bird object could be some kind of drone, the lights could also, etc.) we are trying to keep an open but skeptical mind about these things, but the repeated incidents and so forth lead me to believe that this bears deeper investigation (which I will continue to do as an amateur).<n>

What surprised me was the speed it seemed to travel and the size it was.  Normally, when one sees a plane at that height the plane is small, hard to see, and moving at a speed that appears slow to our relative perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This white colored object, however, was 3 to 4 time larger that a plane would be at that height and is travel through a large cloud break at a very fast pace.

He saw them and found it a strange formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my sight on the brighter craft and could actually see the light changing from yellow to red, I could see it flicker and move.  I know it was very far but I kept my eyes on it.  They moved slowly, during the two and a half hours I watched them I was able to count at least 12 of them.  The diamond-shaped seemed to come together, but kept  the diamond shape while the brighter one on the right began to move in a dancing way from right to left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other 7 were not as bright but were the most active they did the same dancing movement but traveled and disappeared from sight in moderate speed, with the exception of one that confirmed my suspicion it “zoomed” and disappeared near the brightest of them.

Ones with multicolored to plain orb ufo’s.  At 11:37pm on June 15th 2014.  There was a large saucer shaped object with white strobe lights going around it and a red flashing strobe type light on the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time in a week, I have seen this object fly over my house.  It seems to be going west to east or north west to south east.  The first time it was on a different time and day it was moving at a high rate of speed.  Yesterday on the 15th it was coming across my house in the sky.  I was standing on my deck watching it fly over, over by the tree line is a field.  I watched it moving across at a high speed the stop and just setting in the sky it sat there for a good 3 to 4 minutes, I quickly decided to grab my Canon T2i DSLR with 650-1300mm HD Lense  Just inside my french door.  I opened the door grabbed the camera turned around, it was gone, no trace in sight anywhere not a ! out of ordinary light anywhere in the sky to be seen other then stars..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am on the look out for this object again.  For the distance it was in the sky to the scale of a normal airplane at the same distance in the sky, I would say this object was at least 6 times the same of a normal 747.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a nightly basis, I see ufo’s very high up the look like stairs move across the sky, sometimes they make a complete stop then start again and some make complete angle turns impossible for our known aircraft.  I photograph the moon a lot, I have not that I know of caught anything in my photos, but I keep attempting to photograph a UFO, it is my goal as a photographer to get one on film before i die.<n>

I spotted (and heard) a propeller driven and also several jet aircraft.  As they progressed across the sky I could hear them as well.  They were at varying altitudes as observed.  All these aircraft had typical blinking lights as commonly seen on commercial aircraft.  I spotted, then heard, a jet coming south, and it passed my location slightly to the east.  I could hear its engine sound and I estimate its altitude at approximately 5000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I spotted another light object trailing behind the jet by several seconds and going in the same general direction.  It was a very steady non-blinking white light and seemed to be at a much higher altitude.  It was unusual.  The light was bright but not glaringly so.  No sound came from this object as it passed which added to the impression it was at very high altitude.  It proceeded across the sky in about the same time fram! e as the previous jet.  So I estimate its speed to be much faster than the jet in order for it to cover the same distance in the sky in that short amount of time.  Then it quickly faded out.  The visual impression is that it just ascended out of the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed objects before in the sky that I could not identify.  I reported one here several years ago, and one to MUFON.  I received a follow-up inquiry.  In that case, I made further observations of the area of the sky where I&#39;d seen the later object for many days, to be fair and thorough and possibly see an explainable repeat of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my followup observations I determined I could have seen explainable, if even unlikely, naturally occurring phenomena, and I explained that in detail in my followup answers. That is how I answered the follow-up inquiry.  I keep a healthy skepticism.  I do not go looking for unexplained sightings, I simply occasionally sit and relax and look at the night sky.  I am always ready to accept the most likely reasonable explanation.  I think that what sightings are most likely to be, they probably are, and have no illusions or belief agenda to see them to be labeled as “extraterrestrial.”  I will not report a sighting unless I can&#39;t understand what it is.  Only then I think it is my obligation to file a report that might be corroborated or possibly support another&#39;s sighting of the same object.<n>

I glanced upward at one of the trees in the yard and through the branches; I noticed a bright white light flying in the sky at a fairly high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I didn’t think it was unusual because I could only see it partially through the branches and it didn’t seem like a big deal, but then it picked up speed and changed direction a bit and started flying towards us.  I told my friends to look at it and tell me what it was. Well, both of them immediately said, “Holy crap!”  We knew it wasn’t a plane, satellite, helicopter or anything else manmade because this thing was HUGE and it was moving faster than any aircraft known to us.  We were watching it for about 60 seconds with a very clear view of it when all the sudden, it disappeared right in front of our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends have never seen a UFO before and quite frankly, they think I might be a little crazy because I’ve seen so many of them over the years.  But all three of us knew that what we just saw didn’t have a reasonable explanation as it was definitely unidentifiable!!!  We told the other four people in the house about it and they of course thought we were crazy and they didn’t take it seriously at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, about 11:30 pm, we went into the backyard to have one last smoke before bed and I noticed a very small white-greenish light flying about 15ft above us through the trees.  We don’t know if it was some kind of bug or not (although it would have been a little large for a bug), but we have no idea what that was either.<n>

6/16/14 00:15|Omaha|NE|Light|3 minutes|High, very bright steady light moving in a very strange square pattern then disappearing.|6/20/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110352.html|436|ndxe201406| Black, morphing shape object sighted for almost ten minutes with my neighbor in plain sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never really believed in this sort of thing, but I just saw an object in the sky over south Charlotte at 8:00 p.m., 6/15/2014.  It was black and seemed to be a semi-circular shape but seemed to change shape in a slow, wobbly manner.  Almost like a blob or jellyish type structure.  It did not look natural. It either had a bright white light or some sort of reflection of the sun, but it was slowly spinning so the light would come and go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was directly over me and in plain sight at low altitude.  Someone with terrible eyesight could have easily seen it.  I watched it for over five minutes, probably closer to ten.  It moved very slowly, gaining in altitude pretty steeply in regard to how quickly it became too difficult to see.  I recorded it from my phone, but it has no zoom.  By the time I decided to find my phone and record, it had floated quite a distance.  It was indistinguishable on the screen because of its altitude and the sun and lack of zooming ability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor walked out as I was filming.  He watched it with me.  By the time he saw it, the object was at a greater distance and higher altitude so he asked if maybe it was a weather balloon.  It was not, though.  It was almost thickly transparent-like, but then it would “morph” into a jet black with absolutely no plasma look to it.  It did not look like it was “made of matter” in the sense that we usually perceive matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am somewhat shocked because I am a hard sceptic of almost any phenomena reported on any subject.  I called the airport.  They said that they know of nothing in the sky, that there is a National Guard Base nearby.  Really though, I’m not sure why I called them because this “object” did not look natural and moved in a very unnatural manner as well.  It was not a “vehicle” per se.  I am truly at a loss for words.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it earlier this week too, but it was very far away so I didn’t call or make a report because I wasn’t sure what I saw.  On that day, it seemed to hover in a completely still position and darted off at an extremely high speed.  I was intrigued as to what it could be, but it was very far away and pretty much a small, dark spot in the sky.  I am certain now that this was this object or something very similar that I observed.<n>

It had a feel of a hologram but there was just something that gave it depth of field.  I have knowledge of photography and it was so fast you couldn&#39;t have gotten it on camera.

There are 6 miles between the 2 towns and it’s all country.  There are pastures with barbed wire fences and cattle and horses inside, the houses were mostly further back at that time.  There were vehicles behind me and in front of me all during this time.  I’m sure that the vehicles behind me must’ve have seen this thing.  They were pretty close to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed something out of the corner of my eye to my right and saw this small, black, triangular object riding alongside me just on the other side of my passenger window.  If I had been the passenger in my car, I am quite sure I could have reached my hand out of the window and touch it.  It was too small for a person to fit inside and it had a black dome thing underneath.  The edges of the triangle were curved and not sharp looking at all.  I didn’t see any lights, no noise, just this thing that appeared simply out of nowhere.  If I had to guess, I’d say it was most likely 4” deep, maybe 5’ in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going the speed limit of 55 mph which I think was the legal limit at the time.  The object kept in pace with me.  While driving and keeping my eye on the road I kept watching it and it kept my speed.  Once I got into the more populated area, the thing sped up so fast it was out of my sight within 2 seconds!  Once I got to work my manager took a look at my face and she said, “You look like you just saw a ghost!” I told her what happened and she believed me.  One final note, this was the 3rd time I had seen this object.  The other 2 times were in the back roads of Talala: hovering over a tree and once hovering over a small pond.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

It at first seemed to be rising straight up from N of the town as I was facing N, then I realized it was high in sky approaching me (flew directly over the Fair grounds where I was camped).  (Still possible it did rise straight up then gradually increase altitude as it approached me.)  I think within a few seconds, it was a few thousand feet up, it gradually disappeared in size and brightness into the sky in the S at about a 20 degree angle from &#34;straight above me&#34; or about 70 degrees from the horizon if 90 degrees is straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Silent.  About same speed as a jet airliner, or faster.  Took less than a minute for whole sighting (est. did not time it) rectangular, length to width ratio not as long as a cell phone (a bit more square) orange, fuzzy edges, within it taking up about half or 40 percent of the total area was a fire or flame, aiming down but the flame was like looking directly at a jet plane exhaust or looking into the flaming nozzle of a gas fired device.

I looked up and  there was a cluster of bright white lights, perhaps a hundred.

The red glow was more than twice the size of the off white area of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was directly overhead when I first saw it, moving at about the same rate as I have seen thousands of airliners overhead here at around 5000 foot altitude, but no position lights were flashing.  It moved from SE to NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear, I could see a full field of stars from horizon to horizon.  This object remained at the same rate of travel, then disappeared when it was 32 degrees from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Given the day and hour, it may have been the sun playing off an airliner, but I&#39;ve been watching the sky for 45 years in Michigan, and have never seen anything anywhere near what I just saw.<n>

What brought my attention, it was abnormal in color and flickering and standing still just above the horizon. I watched for a few moments then at an unbelievable speed it zipped to the left and stopped, I knew because of the speed it moved it was something to watch. it sat there for a few moments then zipped again this time towards my location, that&#39;s when I thought to myself this thing has amazing speed, then all of a sudden it zipped up at an angle again towards my location traveling so fast it disappeared to what must have been the upper atmosphere, it wasn&#39;t falling it was climbing at such a speed, that nothing I have ever seen before compared to it. Then 2 days later the local news stations reported! UFO&#39;s spotted on or around that same time frame<n>

They looked like they belonged to one very large, triangular aircraft at first, flying too low and coming from the wrong direction.  But there is a local airport, so I know very well what low-flying planes look and sound like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights then started to move west again, farther away from me, and I could see that they were moving separately.  Their flight was quite low, and as I watched them move farther away to the west they started to fade and then disappeared altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, around 10:40 p.m. EST I saw another, singular orange light come from the southwest direction.  It flew more slowly than the previous two, but seemed to follow their trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as before, as I watched it fly farther west before it faded and then seemed to disappear.<n>

Once I did we were all in awe as it was very unusual.  It was quite large and slow moving at first.  It processed in our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched and took a video as it flew over us and kept heading in a south ward direction.  It then started to flicker and sped up very fast so it was a small dot in the sky then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to look for it for a few seconds and it did reappear briefly then finally dissapeared for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We took a video of it flying over us.<n>

The problem was when we got closer, we observed that the object moved.  It was moving REALLY slow.

My house is close to the fireworks and up higher from where they were being set off so we could see them from our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was me, my brother, and my dad for the first few minutes watching the fireworks.  After a while I started to get bored with them and ended up looking to the right in the sky.  Immediately I saw a weird dot that seemed to be made up of different colors.  I told my dad and brother and they saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this moment it was just staying in a single place, not moving left right up or down.  After a couple minutes my dad ran in the house to get my mom and a pair of binoculars.  He came out with the binoculars and we each took turns looking through them.  It gave instant clarity to what we were looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was four separate lights shaped in lines; unfortunately I couldn’t make out a shape, only the lights.  If I were to guess I would say that it was a d! isk.  They almost looked like a crosshair in the sky with each line being a different color.  It was hard for me to see the colors but what I could make out was white, red, green, yellow/orange.  The thing is though is that at least one of them changed colors because I know I saw blue/purple at one point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another couple minutes using the binoculars my mom came out.  I had the binoculars at this point and almost right after my mom came out the colors starting slowly spinning.  I stopped looking through the binoculars and saw that not only did it start spinning but it also went from multiple colors to all white, then all red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was doing this it started moving down and to the right until we lost sight of it behind a tree.<n>

I went outside to bring in items from a yard sale we had earlier that day and I was walking towards my carport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and saw a bunch of circles hovering in the distance and yelled for my sister and her friend to come outside and they freaked out and told me to film it.  I didn&#39;t have my phone so I ran into the house grabbed mine and ran back out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I did that, they grabbed their phones, too.  I started my camera app and tried to record with my iPhone but the lights didn&#39;t show up on the screen, so I put my phone in my pocket and just watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it started moving towards us and as it got closer it looked more and more like a triangle and I pulled out my phone again and could see the lights on the screen, so I started to record it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object passed over-head, it was massive.  Others and I estimate it to be 300 to 500 feet wide in size.  The object emitted 6 lights.  The front light was white, followed by a set of 2 lights that were red/green at the same time, and those where followed by a set of three white/yellow lights.all of the lights pulsated.  It continued on a path south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remembered that my friends had just left and shouldn&#39;t be that far down the road so I stopped recording and called them and told them to look towards the sky towards my house they pulled over on the highway and watched it while discussing it with me till it was out of sight.  Other people I don&#39;t even know have reported seeing it on Facebook too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry for the profanity in the video she was a little freaked out.  I have tried submitting this to MUFON twice and within hours the case is missing from there database I screen shotted the thank you note that includes the case numbers as proof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the UFOstalker web site which automatically saves cases to track in real-time still has these cases listed along with the descriptions.  I just find it weird that MUFON would do this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So hopefully you guys can help me identify this object because it was truly amazing.<n>

This object was far too wide to be plane.  I estimate that the object was a few thousand feet from the ground, as it was below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights from this point of view were in flat string, as if all the lights were in a row on the same level.  The lights stayed there for about 5 minutes, without moving.  There were 5 lights, 4 red and one yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it hovered for about 5 minutes, it began moving towards the Northwest.  There was no sound coming from the object. It had a triangular shape.  There were two lights in the front, two lights on the outer tail-end wings, and one located in the middle of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved in a very direct path.  As it was moving northwest, it changed shape.  The rear right light (when looking at it, the rear left light if looking at it from behind), moved to the front of the object as if it was rotating, however the object never changed paths.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object was coming from the North, a slight outline of the object could be seen, which was triangular.  The sun had set, but the sky in the northwest was still a light blue color.  As it moved into the light blue area of the sky, it was clear that the object was transparent.  The outline of the object could no longer be seen.  We could see the sky through the object, as if the object was not there at all. The object continued moving northwest until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other vehicles/objects that were seen following this craft.  Upon further investigation on the Internet,  I found that someone had reported a helicopter following the same path (of an object of the same description) about 2 hours after the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything of this size in the sky, nor have I ever seen an object change shapes while continuing to move in the same direction.  It’s hard to say due to the unknown distance and height how big the object was.  Although even if it were a plane straight over our heads it would only be a fraction of the size of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate that it had to be 1000+ feet in length.<n>

Our flight had been delayed for several hours due to mechanical errors and then poor weather conditions, so we were on the runway waiting to depart along with several other airplanes that were also delayed.  Our plane was just sitting on the runway waiting for other planes to lift off.  I was looking out the window watching how many planes were just sitting there as it was a really weird to see 8-10 planes lined up like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then that I noticed a small bright light becoming larger and brighter at around 3000 ft and about a ¼ of a mile away from our plane.  I think we were looking towards the South, but I don’t know that for sure.  It was too low to be a planet or star and it was most definitely not a plane or helicopter as it sat stationary.  I asked my friend sitting next to me what she thought it was and she said she thought it was a satellite.  I laughed and said that there was no way it could be a satellite as it was just sitting there and the fact that it was so low and bright, that no satellite could do that, so I kept watching.  This is where it got really weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It first appeared as a small white-yellowish light that became larger and brighter right in front of my eyes.  Then it became about the size of a dime (a little smaller actually) at arm’s length. It sat there for about 45-60 seconds, moved a little to the left, and then it disappeared. I pointed out to my friend that it just disappeared and she said, “Well, that’s not a satellite then!”  I kept looking to see if it would come back and it did!  This time, it did the exact same thing as before, starting out as small, got bigger and brighter, stayed put for a bit, and then moved to the left, and then it disappeared again.  But this time, my friend saw it come back and watched it do exactly what I described the first time.  We were blown away as it seemed to be observing all the aircrafts lined up waiting to take off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were complaining about just sitting on the runway with no movement, it came back a 3rd time and made itself known in the exact same fashion as the previous events.  This time I took a picture of it with my new phone.  I haven’t figured out a way to make the picture bigger or clearer yet, but I’m excited to see what it’ll look like once I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the following night in Cape Cod, I and 2 other friends had another sighting that just blew our minds!  I’ll make another report for that sighting under the state of Massachusetts in a little while.<n>

My first thought was balloons, but because they were moving so perfectly together (in sync) slowly and going against the wind and clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The clouds were coming in from the North West going east.  Not sure if it was light reflecting off of them, but they appeared to have small arced wings, again most likely spheres?<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for about 15 minutes and then it just disappeared in some clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My whole family saw them, and we can only say there were like nothing we&#39;ve seen before in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do have a lot of jetliner activity over our area going from SF to LA (North to South).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Spheres, commercial sub-orbitals, balloons, or small drones?

They &#34;appeared&#34; rather than &#34;approached&#34; as would be the case with any traditional aircraft.  These objects were not unlike a satellite in size but unlike a satellite they did not move across the sky at the expected speed.  They hovered and moved very slowly in a more or less linear formation in the direction of Palmdale and Lancaster.  These objects seemed to leap frog one another at times, appearing and reappearing.  They eventually moved out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five or ten minutes later, my interest peaked, three more objects appeared very near the same position, directly above me.  Similarly, the three objects were small white circular lights hovering at an extremely high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the lights was flashing, reflecting light back, unlike any of the other lights previously observed.  I interpreted this as the one object to be rotating with a reflective surface. Like the other objects, these three moved away slowly and eventually out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I observed these truly unusual objects I had plenty of time to consider the possible explanations.  I ruled out conventional aircraft.  These things were hovering. They moved much too slow and were at too high an altitude.  I ruled out satellites.  They were too close to one another and satellites don&#39;t just &#34;appear&#34; and they don&#39;t move in mass formations.  I ruled out stars.  Duh.  I could not, however, completely ruled out high altitude weather balloons of some kind.  They were not any sort of balloons I&#39;m aware of at the least.  If they were balloons, they were huge and moving in formation with one another and one was flashing or reflecting light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With Edwards AFB so close, I am guessing these things were military in origin.  The funny thing is that moments before I saw them I said to myself I wonder if I&#39;m going to see any UFO&#39;s this time, and sure enough there they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pretty cool and interesting sighting for me.  I&#39;ll never forget it.  I just wish I had a telescope with me!<n>

I thought at first it was a small airplane pulling a banner but the shape and movement was wrong.  Then I thought it might be a parachute but it was not that.  There were two objects, a larger and a smaller one, it was like the smaller one was being towed by the larger, both very high up in the sky up over the 805 freeway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both were kind of floating, moving slowly yet steadily.  Maybe diamond or triangle shaped, if I had binoculars I might&#39;ve been able to see more detail.  It seemed almost like a kite type of a floating or debris of something that caught the wind but they were not kites.  I looked out my other bedroom window that faces south and there was a larger one that was slightly closer yet still high up in the sky.  It was similar to the other objects but I just couldn&#39;t make out what it was. I had never seen such objects in the sky before, they weren&#39;t planes.  I watched the third object until it disappeared in the blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to my east window and the two original objects were gone.  I should note that I could see airplane traffic in the distance to the north-east, planes travel a set path to land at Lindbergh Field and I could easily see even from a far distance they were planes.  The objects I saw were not the same.  Could not identify them as anything specific.  I thought maybe I could see a very faint aura around the two in the east but it might&#39;ve been the light or my eyes adjusting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Looking south, with a 25’ light pole &amp; the Sun to my left, a 35’ tree top to my right, with them being 23’ apart and at about the 12:30 o’clock height, I saw what could only be described as a transparent 4 winged aircraft with a fuselage.  (Now I don’t mean the aircraft by Virgin Airlines, or any of the other proposed invisible aircrafts and currently not the size of the craft that Wonder Woman would fly…….but, it looked very close to it and a whole lot larger.)  This was either a clear aircraft or with a skin that would reflect what was above it (like the invisible cape).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft looked somewhat like what we are used to seeing except the wings were twice the size of the fuselage.  I judged its size by the above dimensions and a passenger jet at cruising speed in the distance at about 2 o’clock.  The planes were flying different directions.  It flew a straight line and could even possibly be the International Space Station, although it really didn’t look like the ISS.  It did take about what I would perceive as 30 seconds to travel from the top of my tree to the top of the light pole and then into the Sun’s rays, blocking my view, while the other craft was still chugging along.  The commercial airliner had a contrail and the clear one did not have one.  Experimental aircraft?<n>

I observed my first and only two UFOs ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of these sightings occurred within a 6-month period from the same general location.  Since these objects appeared to be about the same size and shape, I have the impression that both sightings might have been of the same craft; however, I have no other proof of this assumption.  These are given in chronological order, and the first sighting in 2013 was vague, distant and impersonal – I did not file a report on it then, nor even mention it to anyone, including my wife.  By contrast, the second encounter in 2014 was a life-changing event – it was shocking to be shown that we humans are not the only intelligent beings here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second, very much unexpected and extremely more vivid sighting occurred six months later at 11:00 pm on Friday night, June 13, 2014, near Hexter Elementary School.  I had walked to Gold’s Gym at Northcliff &amp; Buckner at 9:30 pm and had left at 10:50 pm.  It was a beautiful night, comfortably warm, the sky was clear with a full moon and no wind, and there was not the usual city noise.  Nobody else was seen outside and there was no automobile traffic in the neighborhood.  I was walking alone in the middle of the street in the full moonlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was traveling roundabout back to my house, a lighted craft suddenly appeared high over me at Northlake near Peavy.  I was rounding a curve heading generally northward and the lights cleared above the 30-foot trees to my right, or east side.  This occurred within the usual flight path of airplanes originating from south Texas and landing at Love Field; however, at this time most scheduled Southwest Airline flights had finished for the night – which seemed to be a very important factor in the presence of this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before 10:00 pm, mostly 737s and some corporate jets fly over here at about 8,000-feet or 1.5-mile altitude, heading north to cross I-635 where they will make a left, west to south U-turn and land at Love Field.  Now, there were not any planes in the sky anywhere.  Subconsciously, I assumed the lights were an airplane, but the object actually stopped directly above me as I was walking alone in the middle of the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I instantly looked up and felt that it had be! en watching me on the roadway in the full moonlight – I was the only rabbit alone on the road.  The craft appeared to be positioned almost 1-mile straight up – maybe 1 or 2-degrees eastward – with the apparent size of a large corporate jet; it seemed to be slightly smaller than a 737.  Although it is difficult to estimate size and height at night, I am reasonably sure that it was not over 1-mile, nor under 1/2-mile. (I have since studied airplanes flying directly overhead to confirm this perceived altitude and size.) -See illustration of UFO provided - It had extremely bright lights of pure colors, the brightest I have ever seen and the most beautiful red and green. There was no softness to the lights, only a sharp piercing glare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had a strange jerky aspect unlike any aircraft.  No Federal Aviation Administration navigation lights were apparent – specifically, green on the starboard, red on the port, flashing strobes on the wingtips, with fore and aft white lights as required below 10,000 feet altitude.  Its lights were arranged in a nonsensical pattern as in my diagram above, with the red lights blinking on and off every 2-seconds – this appeared to be the front, as the craft moved.  All of the red lights pulsed together; there was no 1-2-3 sequence.  The green lights shined steady, did not blink and appeared to be the sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each red and green row was composed of about 10 individual pinpoint lights, all like bulbs with equal intensity. No other lights, colors or emanations could be seen.  My sketch diagrams the bel! ly of the craft as seen from below.  The body was not visible as a silhouette against the sky because of the bright lights; however, I am certain that there was a rigid structure because the lights maintained their relative position at all times.  If I were to guess, I would say the object was rather triangular because of the arrangement of the lights, but I cannot be sure of this.  It had a clear-cut, garish carnival midway appearance – there was no vagueness at all.  My initial and vivid impression was as if a Texas State Fairground contraption, such as a Ferris wheel, with its colorful, blinking lights, had been placed 1-mile overhead in the night sky to float around –  it was totally out of place and illogical.  I instantly realized that this was not an airplane, so I quickly stepped under a front yard tree to my right or east side on Northlake, to hide from its view.  My actions were largely reflexive and fear-responsive, so I probably was only visible to the craft for a few! seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after I hid, the object seemed to have lost me, because it began to go back and forth, do figure-8s, hover and rock as I watched from between the leaves. Imagine that you are standing on the bottom of a lake watching the bottom of a big motorboat circling above you on the surface; similarly, seen by me from below, the circling craft acted as though it was floating on a flat horizontal surface.  The effect was like looking up at the bottom of a large launch that was being driven around on a choppy lake surface; perhaps the medium or force upon which the craft rode – or it created – was wavy.  The craft stayed contained within an imaginary circle of about 1/4-mile diameter eastward of me as it apparently searched; it never strayed to the west side of me.  Of course, its actions were faster than a motorboat as it maneuvered around searching the bottom below.  When it stopped, it seemed to rock like a boat, as though floating on waves.  The craft appeared to be driven or controlled by a coxswain who was methodically searching the bottom below, making its movements selective, erratic and chaotic as it went back and forth, repeatedly, stopping and going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object emitted a very faint but perceptible whirring sound from high up, similar to an electric motor brush.  This sound had that same distant overhead audio quality as some hot air balloons, ultra-lights and blimps that I have heard from the ground while they were high above me; I have heard voices, burners and motors from these.  With this UFO, I had both eyed and eared confirmation of an actual materially structured mechanical craft and of its apparent vertical distance above.  Furthermore, the tone or pitch of the electrical motor sound seemed to change throughout its movements overhead, as though accommodating various mechanical requirements.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout all of this, I was busily playing devil’s advocate – “Could this be an electrically powered human-fabricated aircraft?”  Suddenly, I realized that if whatever was controlling this thing had infrared vision that I had better get behind the wooden tree limbs, which I promptly did.  For whatever reason, the object appeared to be searching for ground-based subject matter, so I remained cowing against the tree trunk and became a certified tree-hugger.  To add to my problems, the front yard’s motion detector light turned on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This weirdness went on for the longest three minutes, my anxiety level was rising and I began to wonder how it would all play out.  Suddenly, without any warning, the object instantly streaked nose-first at a downward angle, around 45-degrees, east-northeast toward the Lochwood Park area. It went from hovering almost directly overhead, down to the horizon, traveling over a 1-mile distance, at one constant and terrific speed. There was no observable acceleration against inertia or deceleration against momentum. I have watched high-performance jets stall out several miles above and then rev up to flight speed – this takes several seconds. My UFO did this instantly! When its lights disappeared through the trees and just above the horizon, it was still travelling at the same speed without slowing down. Its observed lack of inertia and momentum implied that the object had no mass, as though it were only a mirage or light image, and it actually looked somewhat that way during the d! ive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I could only see the lights, the craft appeared to be intermittent between a real object such as a bus or airplane, and an artificial movie-projected image of such. That is, at times, it would have passed for a solid material night-flying helicopter; while at other times, the lights seemed transparent and unreal, like projections on a movie screen. The greatest division in this dichotomy appeared between the very separate hovering and diving phases. During the overhead circling, I felt as though I could rap my knuckles on the craft; conversely, during the dive, I felt as though my arm might go through it. This division was reinforced by the whirring mechanical sound of the craft as it hovered, contrasted by the total silence when it dived at supersonic speed. Lending to this impression, a solid form would have created friction, pushed the air aside and made a horrific noise; this thing made no sound whatsoever. There was no noise at all during the dive – any air-dis! placement whoosh, sonic boom, crash or explosion – anything! Artillery shells make a distinctive sound as they pass through the air, and this speeding UFO should have done likewise. Incredibly, there appeared to be no resistance from the air. I felt that if I had shot this thing with a rifle, the bullet would have gone through it. Because of the lack of both inertia and air resistance, I must assume that there was no solid object – AS WE KNOW IT – during the dive phase. This raises my question of whether the UFO was somehow outside of our physical reality, a consideration that might apply to the origin of these things. I assume that a craft from another solar planet or star system would obey the same Newtonian physical laws that we do – but this thing did not do this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> - See diagram of flight path provided - Visualize a right triangle with me on the ground at the 90-degree angle, and the craft 1-mile above me, searching within a 1/4-mile diameter circle to the east.  The full Moon is southeast, at about 50-degrees elevation at 11:00-pm CDT, at its lowest zenith in June – exactly opposite the Sun. The UFO dove toward the east-northeast at about a 45-degree angle. I have fine-tuned the compass direction with several visits; however, because it dived away from me, the exact descent angle cannot be exact.  Therefore, I have bracketed or averaged it as 45-degrees, and the ‘landing point’ would be approximately 1-mile away horizontally at the other 45-degree angle.  On the map, that would be around the Lochwood Park area.  Draw a line from Northlake-Peavy east-northeast across Lochwood Park and somewhere along this track is where the UFO ‘landed.’  By geometry, the flight path or hypotenuse would be about 1 1/4-mile long – or a little over 1-mile when discounting the 10-degree roofline.  The object’s closest proximity to me would be about 7/10-mile as it slid down the hypotenuse.  I watched its lights through the trees until the craft was about to slam into the ground about 1/10-mile above the actual horizon.  Seeing the UFO dive to the horizon greatly helped me to scale and confirm my original vertical estimate as about 1-mile altitude, and no lower than 1/2-mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have used three methods to determine and confirm the exit speed as about Mach-1.  First, my daughter and I have attended the Fort Worth Alliance air show annually for over twenty years – a father-daughter thing.  There are always jet interceptor fly-bys, usually by an F-18 Super Hornet, at Mach-1, whereby the sound shock wave is visible forming off the fuselage.  The June 13 UFO simply appeared to be diving that fast and that is what I settled on. Second, it took no more than 5-seconds for the craft to go from 1-mile overhead, then 45-degrees downward to the horizon, a dive distance of over 1-mile.  Here, I estimated the dive time, based upon my gut feel of 5-seconds.  Third, at home I pointed my finger at an imaginary UFO and had my daughter time my downward sweep with a watch, always getting about 5-seconds.  In summary, 1-mile multiplied times 5-seconds works out to 720-mph, or about Mach-1.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the short end of the spectrum, time is easy to estimate. Two, five and ten-seconds can be accurately guessed.  As time gets longer, estimating becomes more inaccurate – one minute is more difficult and an hour is even more so.  Five-seconds were easy to guess and to confirm by dragging my hand downward and having someone else clocks me.  My object had lights that pulsed every two seconds and it dove within about five seconds – these times were simple to bracket and measure.  I estimated that the craft hovered above me for 3-minutes because it seemed like 3-minutes, even when considering the lengthened anxiety factor.  In addition, I bracketed the hovering phase – it was certainly longer than 1-minute and probably shorter than 5-minutes – thus, 3-minutes.  My calculations of distance, time and speed all conform to one another mathematically – its red lights blinked every two seconds, the object hovered about 1-mile above for 3-minutes and exited at a 45-degree downward angle, di! ving within about 5-seconds at a speed of around 720-mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft streaked downward toward the horizon, its lights were visible through the nearby trees, but of course, the lights were blocked when they went behind the roofline.  The angle of total disappearance was about 5 or 10-degrees above the actual horizon, which would have been about 1/10-mile above the ground at the ‘point of impact.’  Seeing the object go through the far tree line greatly reinforced my vertical estimate as 1-mile distance.  The UFO’s path of descent formed an imaginary ‘hypotenuse of a right triangle,’ which is depicted in the third diagram.  At the horizontal, its size and distance could be compared to foreground features – much as a rising full moon can be compared to nearby hills, trees, houses and so forth – this confirmed my estimation of the overall scale of the UFO flight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The contrast between the 3-minute hovering and the 5-second dive was astounding, and suggested that there were two methods of control during these two phases – manual and autopilot.  This dichotomy erased all doubt as to whether or not this was a human construction.  The circling and wobbling object appeared to be silly, jerky, and almost Warner Brothers cartoonish with the super bright garish lights – the reds pulsing on and off, and the greens glowing steadily.  The searching was asymmetrical, irregular and chaotic – as though a coxswain was steering the boat randomly and impulsively as he searched the ground far below.  If I had witnessed only the hovering phase, I would not be convinced that it was not some type of human-made aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By contrast, had I seen only the 5-second dive, I would not be convinced that it was not some reentering satellite debris.  This exit plunge was straight, steady, mechanical, meteor-like and almost blurred.  Unlike in its erratic circling phase, the fast diving craft did not appear to be arbitrarily piloted, but went down uniformly at a constant speed in a straight line from A to B as though programmed and automatic.  It appeared as if a switch was flipped, which said, “Take me from here to there.”  Certainly, no human pilot would have had nerve reflexes fast enough to control this suicide dash downward and I assume the same for any biological organism.  As it dove, the form or basic structure of the object was perfectly retained – the blinking red bar of lights in front and the two steady green rows of lights on the sides. However, more so than when it was circling, the craft looked strangely like an artificial light image as it dashed downward, with the pulsing red lights at th! e front. Possibly, the angle of the lights were turned away from me somewhat, making them appear dimmer, thus contributing to the dichotomy of appearance. The object went down angled into the dive and all of its light structure was retained intact, as though it being a rigid object. However, both of these phases, when put together said that this was not grandma’s biscuits. I looked straight at this thing for 3-minutes as it hovered, and for 5-seconds as it dove – it definitely was NOT a human-made aircraft! A saying goes that we should always look for ponies before we look for unicorns. In the best tradition of looking for ponies, immediately following the sighting I attempted to eliminate all plausible possibilities. I considered a DRONE as an explanation, and several other folks, including my wife, have since offered the drone scenario (which seems to be the contemporary Debunker explanation for all UFOs today). This would certainly fit the hovering and whirring electric motor sound, since several drone models are electric powered hovering devices. Immediately after this event, I asked myself, “Did someone launch and retrieve a drone from the Lochwood Mall parking lot?” However, I quickly dismissed my devil’s advocacy here because this explanation would have been more unrealistic than a ‘flying saucer.’ The large size, mile altitude, glaring lights and exit speed ruled against a drone. Hobbyist’s electric RC craft are small, weak and slow, and they fly at very low altitudes. ! Military drones are larger and more powerful, but still rather slow. These are secretive, conserve power to remain on patrol for long periods, and they do not waste batteries on bright lighting; the CIA is not going to advertise its presence with glaring, blinking lights. All of this goes against the large corporate jet-size of my UFO, which was hovering 1-mile up with lights blazing while milling back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Consider the Mach-1 exit speed. No drone, civilian or military, is streamlined or powerful; indeed, such a design would be antithetical to the hovering purpose of a drone. All drones have propellers or rotors. No propeller driven airplane has ever achieved Mach speed and survived – ever!  This formidable velocity requires an aerodynamic, reinforced coke bottle-shaped fuselage, sweptback razor thin wings, and a turbojet engine with a powerful afterburner.  Even the fabled F-86 Saber Jet and MiG 15 of Korean War vintage could not reach the speed of sound.  Moreover, no human-constructed aircraft – prop or jet – would have pulled out of such a steep dive at that speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, yet importantly, all aircraft, civilian and military, CIA or FBI, drone or whatever, flying high in United States commercial airspace are required by law to conform to FAA lighting standards.  This is to prevent mid-air collisions with other planes.  As ruled by the National Transportation Safety Board, an ‘aircraft’ is any device used for flight in the air – there are no exceptions!  My observed object was violating a main landing flight path over northeast Dallas, which would have been filled with vulnerable commercial Love Field traffic an hour earlier.  It was shining and blinking bright garish lights that were arranged in the bizarre pattern illustrated above, that made no sense and which conformed to no codes or regulations.  If it were any human-made object, it would have been flying illegally and in violation of United States law.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My UFO had a definite symmetrical structure, differential lighting, a variable mechanical sound, a 3-minute time of operation and a complex behavior, so it was not a natural phenomenon such as a mirage, ball lightning, plasma, Venus, meteor, swamp gas and so forth. It moved back and forth against the wind, so it was not a passive lighter-than-air object such as a balloon, kite or Chinese lantern. During its high-speed dive, the UFO exhibited no inertia or momentum, and it made no sound; therefore, it was not a human-made aircraft – no human construct can do this. All of this taken together leaves only a NOT human solution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of interest, the June 13 object appeared to be predatory by its raptor-like tactics. First, there was the sneaking up and hovering above me. Second, after I hid under a tree whereby it lost me, the craft started to circle as though scanning the ground for a replacement. Third, it seemed to have spotted another ground-based subject, toward which it made a dive. (Of course, we want to believe this target was an abductee – whether true or not.) The entire affair was reminiscent of a hawk circling in the sky and stooping at a mouse in a field. I suspect, but will never know, that my quick reflexive hiding may have saved me from being confronted by whatever was operating this thing. It was never closer than 7/10-mile during the 5-second diving. Other than the expected natural anxiety and elevated adrenaline, I have never experienced any unusual symptoms then or afterwards. I actually arrived home earlier than planned because I did not proceed with my exercise walkabout, thus had ! no ‘missing time.’ Several months later, I have not experienced any side effects, so I guess that I am in the clear… The weirdly blinking red and the stationary green lights made no sense; were they designed for them or for us? I have reviewed many other UFO reports and have never seen any pattern described like mine; therefore, I assume it was either a custom job or the object could configure its own lighting scheme.  All that I can surmise is that the garish, colorful lights might have been an enticement or gimmick to instill interest and attract a sucker to stand still and gawk. I know that I certainly was enticed to observe this thing; only my fear of the unknown overrode my curiosity and kept me from standing in the open street and observing it.  This entire affair became a delicate balance between me hiding from the craft and me peeking at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of note, the UFO did not execute whatever action it desired, against whatever ground-based target it apparently had – from high up during its hovering position.  There were no visible projectiles, rays or whatever extending downward from the object toward any ground subject; conversely, there was nothing from the ground, which came upward to the craft.  Apparently, the object had to dive physically from its mile-high perch down to whatever it had targeted at ground level.  It appeared to have needed to get near whatever its interest was to accomplish whatever it wanted to do.  This would be like a hawk needing to get down grasping a mouse with its talons.  I estimate that the UFO ‘landed’ somewhere along a straight path, east-northeast from Northlake-Peavy, with Lochwood Park as the central impact.  It was traveling at a constant Mach-1 velocity as it approached about 1/10-mile above the ground.  I did not see it again as I walked home after that, so the object either stopped instantly or else it drilled into the ground.  Afterwards, there was no explosion, no news report and no evidence of damage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two days after my June 13 observation, I wrote a short letter to the Dallas Morning News in hopes that other witnesses, perhaps near Lochwood Park, had seen where the object went and what it did after plunging below the tree line.  My letter was not published, which suggests that when these things are reported to the mainstream news media, they are laughed off.   Circuitously, since no one hears about them, there is nothing to them!  During my lifetime of 74-years, I have never seen anything that I could not explain; I can even explain my two Unidentified Flying Objects and thus make them Identified Flying Objects – they simply are highly advanced machines, designed, built and operated in our atmosphere by intelligent creatures that are NOT human.  What these beings are or where they are from, I can only speculate; however, their existence and activity in our environment is a 100-percent fact, from my direct observations.  This reality should help support those claims by other witnesses of fantastic and bizarre UFO occupant activity, as being a very real physical possibility.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the testimony given here is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of two high-quality reports which have been submitted by the same witness.

It flew more slowly than the previous two, but seemed to follow their trajectory. Just as before, as I watched it fly farther west before it faded and then seemed to disappear.<n>

In the second shot I noticed just to the left of the sunset I saw a slightly blurry, metallic, football looking object up in the sky.  It looked like it was moving pretty fast and away from my position, like it was flying at the sunset.  When I enlarged the object it looked like it had a kind of haze or shimmering affect in the immediate area around the object.<n>

On one of the trips to the car I noticed in the distance several bright orange lights approaching from the southwest.  The lights appeared orange in color and I thought at the time they would probably turn out to be the red and green wing lights of an aircraft, once they got closer and I could see more detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I soon could see that there were three orange lights each separated by perhaps a half mile. They moved one after the other towards the northeast and then each in turn seemed to turn more northward in direction.  I thought anytime now I would see the flashing strobes of the planes, as we had seen various private and military aircraft all week.  The strobes never appeared, only a very bright intense orange light which never wavered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since read reports of “Chinese lanterns” being released in the past, while researching what I had seen, but I find it hard to believe the quality of the light I witnessed was the flickering of a candle.  In addition the height and speed of the objects approximated that of the aircraft I had been seeing in the preceding days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first orange light flew almost directly overhead and while I listened intently for the sound of an engine there was total silence except for the occasional sound of thunder from a lightning storm just to my northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to ask one of our traveling companions to take a look and then looked back at the lights and the third light had disappeared, I don’t know what happened to it as I had only turned away for a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, as the second orange light passed by, there was an extended lightning strike from the storm which lit up the sky.  I could see nothing but the second orange light with no shape or body connected to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But moving across the sky behind it was a black or dark grey shadow that seemed to pulsate and change shapes stretching first longways and then sideways in an alternating fashion.  I then lost sight of all three objects.<n>

It was clear.  The sky was pale blue with no cumulus clouds in sight.  I observed what appeared to be a red egg-shaped object in the sky moving westwardly (Object A).  I guessed it could be a red party balloon until I realized that if it was a party balloon, it was positioned far too high in the sky for me to have been able to discern either a shape or color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw a second structure (Object B) following behind it.  Object B was not solid, and I can only describe it as being similar to an old fashioned box kite.  Both objects appeared to be at the same height, moving westward and the whole incident lasted no more than 15 seconds.  Then both objects abruptly disappeared.  The objects did not fall nor did they go behind a cloud . . . both objects were just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Possibly this can be explained as something common or ordinary, but I have never seen anything like this before.<n>

All of this took place in about 5-10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the 4 lights disappeared two objects with faint whitish blinking lights were flying through the sky.  They started out in line with each other with one above and one below, and proceeded to fly on a diagonal trajectory meeting, or coming very closing to each other and then vanishing.

About three minutes later my mom came running in the house telling me to go outside.  My neighbors across the way said there were 30 lights over their house which moved in the direction of NE from Sky Harbor airport, from the location of my house the lights were NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a amateur deep space astrophotographer, so I definitely can identify any normal aircraft or lights in the sky when I see them.  By the time I got outside there were 20 lights.  I did not want to move for fear I might miss something.  I ran to grab my Canon rebel T3i with the telephoto lens.  When I went outside my hands and body were so shaky, I guess that is why spare of the moment photographs of UFO&#39;s are not clear.

After looking at the picture I noticed what appeared to be a “blob” on the picture.  I looked at the “blob” and noticed it was a black dot that had appeared in the night sky and could be seen as a result of the intensity of the lightning.  The lightning had lit up the night sky as to make it day and you can clearly see this black dot in the sky when you freeze the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I replayed the video to make sure there were no low flying planes in that specific area and showed this picture and video to two other people to verify the accuracy of what I thought I saw.  In the picture you can see a cylindrical object in the sky and as you zoom in, you can clearly see what appears to be some type of “force field” surrounding the object.<n>

It was somewhat close to the Moon at first.  My eyes were glued to its position, because this was no plane or helicopter.  I could tell by its movement which was obviously free of any particular direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, after a few seconds, the light turned off as it swooped down at an incalculable speed.

I know where most (wandering stars) planets are and a decent amount about where the constellations are.  Look… You know when you have seen one.  There is no question.  Something lets you know that this moment is different from everything else you have witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second sighting I have witnessed in two years.  The first was two years ago (a white orb) between June 6-9, 2012, and just yesterday June 10th, 2014, at 23:00 hours; approximately a year and a day later, which I find to be significant in itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mostly cloudless night, upper atmosphere clouds scarce.  Red light gradually appeared out of no where around 160 degrees SW.  Came into focus for 3-5 seconds then dimmed out the same way it came into focus.  Red light then reappeared at about 125 degrees SW a bit lower on the horizon and disappeared in the same fashion as before.  Then at about 33 degrees on the horizon and at about 135 degrees SW appeared several flashing white/violet lights the size of stars, but within our atmosphere, like sparkles flashing randomly but yet sequentially.  My friend and I both witnessed the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My First Sighting:  The person I saw my first sighting with (different person from this most recent sighting) told me a story in 2010 about being brought up (abducted) and would not discuss it again when I confronted him on the subject at later dates.  I knew for about a year or so I was going to see one soon and was watching the sky intently.  Later that night I asked my friend if we should report it.  Him and his brother said the next time I can report it. I replied to them both by saying, I don&#39;t know,  I have been waiting my whole life to see one; it&#39;s kind of a once and a lifetime experience.  My friend said no maybe in a couple of years and it became clear to me he knew this to be a future factual happening which it has now turned out to be.  There is more to this story; a big piece.  I&#39;m not going to write about it.  Too difficult.  Contact me.<n>

You can see air plains crossing the sky all the time and visible city lights.  To night was a bit strange though, when I went out side I saw what I thought was the moon except it was a color orange that I had never seen before.  I took out my phone to try to take a picture, it was so low in the horizon and so bright, I wanted to see if I could capture the image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing was it seem to be shrinking, and at a fast rate.  I am not good with N,E,S,W directions so I would say it was going forward moving away from me but it didn&#39;t set like the sun does; it just kept getting smaller until it was no longer there.  This left me feeling a bit perplexed, I work over night I have seen the moon in many fazes including the more recent lunar eclipse, after witnessing this I am convinced it was not the moon but I have no clue what it was.<n>

It was seen shooting north across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With a quick glance I first thought it was a shooting star until it came to a sudden and complete stop in the middle of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this occurred I gave the object another look, this is when I noticed the actual size of the orb, it was made of pure white light.  There was only one orb seen at a size much to large to be an aircraft, the light did not flicker or dim, it stayed exactly where it had stopped and did not bob up and down or move side to side at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After staying in place for approximately 45 seconds, it shot off again this time at an unfathomable speed within a few tenths of a second it was out of visible range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One interesting thing is that after looking at maps and trying to see where the orb came from in such a hurry.

Almost looked like a shooting star but wasn’t quite as fast and the light trail lasted longer than most shooting stars I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object disappeared into the clouds, headed towards the moon.  No noise.  Seemed closer to earth than the stars in the sky did.

It would go towards righr, then zip going up, then down, back to one direction and another.  I was able to record it but because it was dark it&#39;s hard to see its direction change but you can still notice it.  It went from solid red, to mix of red and greem, to solid green.

It was moving around in a circular (counter clockwise) motion.  The object seems to show some color (red/green) in some areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the mid section of the cone was the densest where it extended up to a rounded point.

Puyallup wa, 06/09/14<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was setting, the sky was blue and there were clouds speckled amongst it all.  I had been staring at a black object along the horizon for a few seconds, absent-mindedly, before asking my boyfriend “is that a plane or a bird?”  I still wasn’t really thinking anything though.  It was like it hadn’t hit me how unusual this object in the sky was, yet.  My boyfriend stated that it looked like a big balloon from one of the car dealerships nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought about it for a second as I continued to stare but when I noticed that it was moving along the horizon at a steady, slow-paced, straight-lined course I began to think otherwise.  The UFO seemed to shape-shift from almost circular-looking to flat and triangular-kind of pyramid-esq.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft began to slowly ascend, I could see more of its energy field (which surrounding it in its entirety-the energy/light looked like a fan on high speed) the farther it traveled.  It took quite a while to begin looking smaller, but it disappeared about anywhere from 3-10 minutes after it appeared (or so it seemed, I hadn’t looked at the time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend went to grab some binoculars and told me to take some photos while he was gone, I took about 10 photos but the craft showed up in none of them even though it was still in plain sight/large enough to have shown up.

It looked about the size of a large sedan, completely shiny and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed it on its path for 10 minutes asking bystanders what they thought.  No one I asked had any idea as to what it was at all.

Two objects that looked like they were on fire were moving toward my location (south to north) in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The front one was the larger of the two and looked segmented - a bit like a large and a small &#34;orb&#34; joined together, and the second was quite a bit smaller and was a single orb.  The front one had a red and orange glow like fireplace embers, although it was a constant glow and didn&#39;t change.

It was a steady (not blinking) brilliant light that was unlike any type of plane/helicopter/star I’ve even seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving across the sky pretty quickly.  It moved from South to Southwest.  I pulled out my phone and was able to take a video of the object.  It was a cloudy night, so I saw it move across the sky then I was able to see it in front of a group of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued to move in a Southwest direction it eventually disappeared behind the clouds and I didn’t see it again.  Total time of sighting was approx. 1-2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes after that I saw what appeared to be a military aircraft coming from the direction of where we saw the sphere heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My guess would be that the military craft pursued the sphere, then when it broke pursuit it turned around and appeared to be heading towards Whiteman Air Force Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The second I turned, and began to walk down the street, (was walking east), I saw a large fire orange colored object, it basically looked like a giant fireball, or a miniature sun, but was slightly off from a perfect sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew immediately it wasn&#39;t a plane, a star, or a planet, because of its size and distinct orange hue.  It was about the size of a marble.  I couldn&#39;t tell exactly how far away it was, but it appeared to be inside the atmosphere at least, not in space.  It was moving very very slowly, straight down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did manage to capture about a minute and a half of it, but on my cellphone the quality isn&#39;t great.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it might had been a missile of some sort at the time so I was kind of panicked, and since it was moving down, my camera is shaky for some of the footage because I am walking, so I don&#39;t lose sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky wasn&#39;t even fully dark at the time so you can tell even in this bad footage that this object shouldn&#39;t be there, its just too bright, even on my cellphone camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of the footage you can see it begin to blink, it did this several times before shrinking into a much much smaller, yellow sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It still followed its path straight down, until it passed the tree and building line, and I lost sight of it. I wish I had better footage, or more information, but...<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got.  Oh I also forgot to add the object was dead silent.  Shortly after the event, I saw multiple unmarked planes fly in that direction, not all together, but one at a time, about every 30 seconds to a minute apart.<n>

Yellow light in sky, followed by creatures in my bedroom.|6/13/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110096.html|593|ndxe201406| Strobe-like object streaked across the sky extremely fast; disappeared between flashes<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out in the country last weekend in Western New York State:  between Geneseo and Lakeville, on the Western shore of Conesus Lake.  At approximately 1:45 a.m. on Sunday, June 8, I saw an object go streaking across the sky – extremely fast, much faster than a plane.  Although the trajectory looked like a satellite – very smooth and straight from east/southeast to west – it seemed quite close to the earth and flashed at regular intervals. The flashes were equal in intensity and strobe-like.  The object disappeared between flashes and I was able to track it across the sky from flash to flash.  I saw 4 or 5 flashes in all before it was out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashes were white with another color (can&#39;t recall exactly what color).  I would say the object was possibly rectangular or cylindrical.  The whole episode lasted maybe 5 seconds to cross my entire field of view.  Fast!  I’ve briefly researched satellites and this sounds like a “tumbling” satellite, but seems that mine was going too fast for that.  Or maybe it was close to Earth and that explains why it seemed to be so fast?  I have seen one satellite in the past, from deep in the Grand Canyon, and that one was much tinier, fainter, steady (not flashing), and took longer to cross the sky.  I am very curious as to what I saw.  Perhaps it was some other sort of satellite?  I don&#39;t think it was iridium as the iridium flash description I have read does not match what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About me:  I am a lover of the night sky with little technical knowledge.  I live in the suburb of a large city so it is not often that I am in a dark enough place to really enjoy the stars.  I have witnessed two meteor fireballs in my lifetime (one in the Grand Canyon), many asteroids, and one satellite.  At heart I am a scientist and just wish I knew what that was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

On June 8th, at approximately 12:30 AM, while talking to my daughter, from the large picture window, I noticed an extremely bright object moving east across the sky.  The night was calm, very quiet, and mostly clear. The moon was waxing gibbous with illumination at approximately 65%.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon seeing the object, I instinctively ran to the deck for a better look.  My daughter followed and we woke up her beau from his sleep-to-snore fest and he also observed.  Simply stated, we were blown away.  We began to run down every possible scenario of what the object could be and nothing fit.  So in awe, we watched as the massive, brightly shining object moved east across the sky and eventually out of range.  The object was not in the distance, in fact, it flew just above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is hard to describe the nature of its shine - imagine Venus, at her brightest dropped to 15,000 ft. and traveled from west to east  across the sky.  It seemed to emit beams (atmospheric illusion?).  The bright shine was so dramatic that that it made it impossible to discern its form but it was not round, if anything, it was oblong.  It did not blink or twinkle and the form, beams and all, did not change as it moved across the sky.  The object was shinning silver tones with golden hues and the &#34;beams&#34; appeared to have gold tones as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As was the night, the object was dead silent - Orcas Island is surrounded by water so that ruled out one convenient explanation.  Also unusual was that the object did not fly in a continuous straight line, it would also move laterally and also in a squiggly manner. The movements were subtle yet discernible.  The sighting lasted apx. 2 min. and then it flew out of visual range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We work hard, like a beer or two, do fun things and keep it clean.

I was sitting on the patio having a smoke while the dog and cat sat with me.  I noticed what I figured was a plane come from the east.

It was cruising at a pretty good speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my binoculars and could see a green light at one end and a red at the other which again is what made me think it was a small plane although I could not actually see a shape.

I searched and searched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Grabbed the binoculars again but still could not find it.  I put my cigarette out and suddenly seen a flashing light coming in my direction now and it had a beam emitting from it.

Then we walked into the street, and i saw a bright red orange fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it was a meteor, but it had no tail.  It was the brightest object in the sky.  It was a constant red orange color.  It didn&#39;t pulsate.  Best way I could describe it is, a cross between an orb, and the color of a fireball.  I have never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling from the south to the north.  It turned heading slightly northeast before fading, and appeared to reassemble a star.  Then got bright, before fading away again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another bright red orange object appeared in the south before the other one disappeared.  It was traveling north, but took a different path, more northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an airplane in the sky with flashing lights.  Traveling from east to west.  It is impossible for me to guess how far away, or how big it was.  The second ball of light faded, and got bright again.

I yelled to my girlfriend to come look.  I went into the house and had her go out front with me to see this light.  We were there and watched it go out of sight, then another came into view travelling from the south to north.   The second one was following a different path, and like the first vanished from sight behind the mountain to our north.  There was no sound generated from these two objects.  There was only one aircraft in the vicinity with blinking red and white lights.  This aircraft was travelling from the east to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to add that I do NOT believe in these things, however, I thought I should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We see many aircraft and I work on an airport and see many different aircraft.

It was a night with no precipitation and some stars were visible and the moon looked small and faint as if maybe behind a few thin high clouds in the Eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I neared the top of Culler Road, before reaching where Montgomery Avenue meets Culler Road, I looked out my driver’s side window because some very obvious and strange lights were visible in the sky way over top of the roofs of the houses that line Culler Road on my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were very bright and light-orange in color.  They were spherical in shape and hovered in the sky lined up in a horizontal pattern and separated from each other with some spacing between them.  They did not appear to blink or flash upon looking at them with just my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so astonished at the sight of these lights that I sped up my car to get to the intersection of Palm Drive and Culler Road so I could pull off on the side of the road on Palm Drive to get a better look at these lights.  Culler Road had no berm to pull over onto so I had to get onto Palm Drive.  Within about a minute I was on Culler Road and I pulled my car off the road and parked into a cleared area on the right side of the road and I got out of my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were extremely bright and obvious in the sky.  I had never seen such lights in the sky before.  They did not appear to be airplanes as they continued to hover and move very slowly in the Eastern sky moving from my Right to my Left which would be moving in the Eastern sky from South to North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What amazed me so much was that they kept a controlled distance from one another the entire time and they moved in unison and formed, the majority of the time, a straight horizontal line, but at one time I saw some of the lights form almost a right angle with some lights appearing more in a slanted vertical line and others in a horizontal line.  In another instance I remember thinking they almost look like a “Big Dipper” pattern but with maybe one or two “lights” missing from that familiar pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they slowly moved from Right to Left in the sky, the lights in the far-most left would eventually grow dimmer and eventually fade away while additional lights, one at a time, would rise up from the horizon toward my right in the eastern sky and continue to join the trail in the right-to-left movement pattern as the other ones had followed.  They did not move fast.  They moved at a pace between “hovering” and “very slow” and the distance between each light remained almost constant (some did not catch up to others or surpass others…all lights followed the one or ones that were in front of them that were more to the left and moving northward).  All lights moved from south to north (my right to my left) and none stayed stationary or backtracked in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took out my iPhone 5 and opened the camera app and took a few still shots and then decided I should set it on video but was unsure if my phone’s camera would pick up what I saw.  I was able to get a few stil! ls and one short video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In looking back on this experience, I should have tried to count them or call the police or someone else to document what I was seeing because I was alone with I witnessed this.  My estimation was that I saw at least 20 or more individual lights total.  I don’t know how many more might have been in the sky before I was driving up Culler Road where they caught my visual attention that night.  I thought perhaps it might be something from the Pittsburgh Airport or the Air Force base which are both in the direction of where I was looking that night from Palm Drive.  The airport is approximately 20 minutes by car from Weirton and it is northeast from Weirton.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the police 2 days later and also the news station in Steubenville, Ohio which is the city across the Ohio River from Weirton and both said they did not receive any reports of these lights.  I was frustrated because what I saw was definitely something I had never seen before in my entire life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 62-year-old male with a master’s degree in a profession.  I am not any “UFO nut” and am really not sure if extraterrestrial beings or vehicles exist.  I felt maybe these could be some experimental drones or something that the military could be testing at night.  Whatever they were, they were controlled and by no means did they randomly travel across the sky.  They were organized and lined up and spaced themselves as if controlled by some source or intelligence intentionally.  They made no noise or sound in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the National UFO Reporting Center in the State of Washington after doing a Google search of where to report UFOs because the local police and news station treated my verbal report with no interest or concern.  I spoke directly with Peter Davenport who told me he is the director of this organization, and he advised me on how to submit a report and, to keep it “clean,” without bias or contamination, to not read other reports on that website until after I complete my report.  I will complete a report to this UFO Reporting organization and will also submit my still photos and my short video taken from my iPhone 5 on the night of June 7, 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere, eloquent, and sober-minded.

The apartment complex is called The Heights at Old Towne.  The balcony faces to the northeast and overlooks the Elizabeth River, which was host to the Harbor Fest Celebration on the night of June 7, 2014.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireworks were due to start at 21:00, so we decided to get the best view from the balcony.  The barges which sat in the river that launched the fireworks were in our clear sight.  The fireworks would only come from the barges in the Elizabeth River.  At approximately 21:45, I spotted an object slowly crossing the Elizabeth River in the sky above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved at a cruising speed along a deliberate flight path.  The object composed of a burning flame in what we considered its ‘front’, given that it traveled in the direction of the burning flame.  The flame itself was large, and similar to that of a burning candle wick in that the flame burned strongest at the bottom, and flickered as it trailed vertically upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly behind the flame was a translucent white orb, which kept a fixed shape as it traveled intact with the flame.  My two friends also noticed the object, and we deliberated as to what it could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object flew overhead approximately 200-300 feet above us, making it difficult to gauge the object’s dimensions.  That said, I would estimate the object to be of similar size to that of a small hot air balloon.  A hot air balloon this was not.  There was no basket, there were no wires or visible passengers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flame at one point appeared to be under the translucent orb, but only because the object passed overhead.  Even so, there was no mechanism that could be seen connecting the two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved soundlessly as well.  It continued west toward Effingham Street.  When it passed over the balcony of the loft, we lost sight.  The fireworks started some 20 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was no rogue firework that malfunctioned in flight, this was no hot-air balloon, this was not an aerial unmanned drone.  This was not a meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will not disclose our branches of service, but I will come forward with the fact that all three witnesses are active members of the U.S. military.  After much deliberation amongst ourselves, we all agree that the flying object was not manmade.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the interest of our own security and the integrity of our military obligations, we wish to remain anonymous.  However, I am willing to give an interview.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((first name of witness deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the report probably was submitted by a gentleman, who telephoned us over the Hotline.

One had a definite orange to red color, but the others were a shade of silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the 30 minutes of observation numerous jets crisscrossed the sky, many at extreme altitude, but the points seemed to be higher.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all speculated as to what these things could be and we considered weather balloons, but felt uncertain as the objects were stationary (other than the one that moved slowly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all, I missed about 45 minutes due to this distraction, and turned my attention to the event.  When I checked the sky at dusk, all objects were gone.<n>

I&#39;ve seen videos of the same kind of &#34;fleet&#34; all over the world.

It did not fly in a straight line, but had the erratic movement that I&#39;m used to see in these things now.  Reminds me of a drunk trying to get somewhere fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a about as bright as a star, smaller than Jupiter, and the light was steady.  No contrail. Definitely not a meteor.  It crossed the entire sky and must&#39;ve been really high, as it faded out of sight after a couple of minutes for a few seconds, and then came back into view for 20 seconds or so before fading out for good.  There were no other lights, nothing blinking, and there was no noise accompanying it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within 10 seconds or so after that disappeared, I heard what I though was a helicopter coming from where that light had originated, and looked back Northwest to where the light had come from, only to see an even bigger light moving even faster, bearing southwest this time.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, but the sound accompanying it faded out while the light kept moving.  I then thought it might be the ISS, and it turned out it was.  I was able to verify that it had just passed over when I came back inside using the tracker site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the ISS speed away, and immediately saw a third light directly above me, heading straight South.  This one was smaller than the first, and I pegged it as a satellite because it had the usual dim steady light and relatively slow straight movement compared to the first light.<n>

I heard another person who was out on the street exclaim as I saw the second flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also looked like the illumination of fireworks, but again, no sound at all, and just the two bright pulses of green light.  It was impossible for me to tell if it was coming from the ground or from within or behind or above the bank of clouds.  No movement, just the two pulses, separated by about 10 seconds.

I have no history of mental illness, do not drink alcohol nor do I used controlled substances.  The following events concluded at 2243 hours on the same evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first light showed up at 2132 and appeared to be a meteor entering the atmosphere from the eastern shy from Rapid City, SD.  Initially, the light streak seemed to grow into a blue and white ball of light.  The altitude of the light was no more than a 1000 feet and probably about 500 feet.  It traveled due west at an impressive speed.  Then, as it passed over head while I rapidly crossed the car park, with my eyes trained on the light, as to have a longer look, there was a loud pop that echoed off of the adjacent building.  The light speed out of sight as I realized I could use my NOAA application to try to view the path on radar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Using NOAA double Doppler, reflectivity loop, I tract the object as it passed over Idaho and into Oregon.  At which point it fall below the radar&#39;s minimum ceiling making the landing within 20 miles of John Day, OR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a minute of the meteor disappearing of or the radar another member of our bar-b-que party proclaimed, &#34;What the hell is that?!&#34;  All seven of us came to him as he pointed into the sky, saying, &#34;That&#39;s a ball of light!&#34;  I immediately retrieved my binoculars from my vehicle.  Spotting the light with assistance, I observed the light traveling over Rapid City to the ENE in a weaving pattern.  The altitude of this light was about 50,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When this light vacated my binocular&#39;s ability to view, several jets were spotted in the SE sky over Rapid City by another member of our group.  As I trained my binoculars on the jet I could see that it was a group of five F-14 fighter jets.  Only the lead jet had its lights on.  I told the others, &#34;get your binoculars if you have them.&#34;  Another member of our group did retrieve his binoculars in time to see the rapidly moving jets as they traversed the sky and out of our sight  As the evening passed we noticed two other similar weaving light.  All three appeared to be only large balls of light.  No wings, no tails or noses were seen on the balls of light by the three of us with binoculars.  That is in contract to the fighter jets that has clearly distinguishable noses, wings and tails to the point that two of us believed them to be F-14s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2038 hrs., the last lights were seen.  These lights were significantly different from the others in that they were groups of dim lights within the boundaries of slightly brighter lights.  There were three triangular, formations of brighter lights that traveled slowly from south to north.  Within the peripheral boundaries of each triangular pattern were 18 less blight balls of light that seemed to travel freely within the triangular, more brightly lit spheres&#39; boundaries.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, as unexpectedly as they appeared, they disappeared, as if a cloak had been engaged.  There were no more lights as our party peered into the night&#39;s shy well into the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above, to reflect a sighting on June 5th, 2014.

It was definitely quite visible, but hardly discernable!!  Shortly, I called the Denver Police Dept. and inquired if anyone had informed them of something in the sky, to which they said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While speaking with the DPD dispatch, and having had my phone speaker on from the beginning, she could hear myself and all other witnesses excitedly speaking about first one more, then another, only this one was sort of beneath the one on the top, but they were in sync with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DPD transferred me to the FAA, who also reported no reports of activities in the sky inconsistent with normalcy.		 For the next 10 to 12 minutes all six of us witnessed in awe at a beautiful event, ultimately involving not less than six vehicles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were all the same in physical appearances.  They moved horizontal and rather slow, by other accounts of vehicles.  They were steady.  They were red but not fiery red.  All of them were like this.  They were definitely well into the sky.  When, from our view point, they all reached what seemed to be the same juncture, this huge white light appeared in the front of each craft.  Then it went out and more white lights appeared, only seemingly from within the red tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed that a plane was near-by, prompting one child to remark that it was going to collide with this “thing!”  And it sure did look like this was likely from down on the ground, but nothing happened.  Shortly thereafter, another earthly vehicle went by, both vehicles heading northward, opposite the direction of the UFO’S.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we’re all were able to see the earthly vehicles, it made since to me that the UFO’s had to have been relatively close, and the passing of the earthly vehicles provided me with the only reliable means of discerning how far away and how far up they were (as there was no horizon, no sky line … just sky!<n>

Out of nowhere I noticed an orange sort of glowing form in the distant sky, heading Southwest.  It seemed very unusual, so I kept my eye on it, for about 2 minutes.  Then, out of nowhere it stopped and immediately started heading Northeast!  As it reached the middle of the sky (from our point of view) another similar glowing object appeared and the 2 of them crossed paths, and headed in different directions, where within a minute or so they disappeared from my view.  This first encounter lasted about 5 minutes or so total.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed outside until it got darker while my wife went inside.  Not too long after 9 PM or so I noticed a ball of white, dim light (maybe a teardrop shape?) moving horizontally across the sky, just above a distant tree line.  The object then stopped completely, started pulsating white lights for about 10 seconds, then headed out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All 3 of these objects were too far away to make out their shapes, but I would guess either cylinders or teardrops.  And although they all pulsated orange and white lights, they also had a very solid aspect to them, like a craft.  Not sure how to explain that.  One of the greatest things I&#39;ve ever had the chance to witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always believed in this stuff, but have never seen anything first-hand! Wow!<n>

It was about 20:20 in the evening and the moon was about half full.  At this time there were no planes or any aircraft of any kind in the sky which is rare here because I see aircraft of all kinds including military everyday.  I was facing towards the southern horizon and was just star gazing.  I tilted my head looking almost straight up but still more towards a direction of South-South-East.  I was observing what I thought was a cluster of stars until one of the &#34;stars&#34; began moving at a very fast rate of speed and heading towards the southern horizon.  The object looked exactly like a star, same size, same shape and same brightness.  However it was moving and after a few minutes as it continued at the same speed it slowly faded out until it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I have seen satellites a number of times before and even the International Space Station once but this was neither.  It was not long after that in the same small area of the night sky which I had seen the first a second began to move in the same exact way as the first. It was moving in the same direction and again looked exactly like a star and was moving in what appeared to be the same speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to question myself and began looking around for planes but there were none for comparison and these two &#34;stars&#34; made no sound.  The second object then at the same rate of speed faded until it was gone as the first had done.  Both act exactly in the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I got lucky and did see a meteor seconds later which gave me a good reference.  The shooting star had a tail and was gone in a millisecond so that ruled out that possibility.  Then planes flying at high altitude began to fly by making the sounds of jet engines and I could clearly see there navigation lights blinking so that was ruled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the course of the next hour I witnessed 10 of these same exact objects that all behaved the same way, looked the same, traveling at the same speed and fading until they disappeared the same way.  The only thing that happened with the 10 objects that was not consistent was that the eighth one moved due North and the tenth one moved due East the all the others moved due South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all had been stationary and looked exactly like stars. I really thought I was looking at a small cluster of stars but after an hour that cluster was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I do not believe these could have been satellites in Low Earth Orbit or even High Earth Orbit because of the way they behaved.  If it is possible that these objects were in High Earth Orbit and were perhaps part of some secret government space project I can only estimate they were traveling anywhere between 40,000 and 60,000 miles per hour and were being operated by someone or something. That of course is only a theory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do wish I had other witnesses but I live only with my dog.  My dog, ((name deleted)), did act a bit peculiar during this event but I think she was only reacting based on how I was reacting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this amazing experience I went inside and looked on all major astronomical websites to see if there had been any reported meteor showers that could be seen in Northwest Arizona and I found nothing.  I again wanted to just make sure it was not some natural event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday and today I looked on all major UFO reporting websites and found no such reports that saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought the Ghost ship witnessed by myself, a crewman and an entire flight crew on a U.S. Coast Guard HH-60 Jayhawk in the Willipa Bay, Washington, was strange enough when I was stationed at Cape Disappointment.  However this one certainly equals it.<n>

We exited I-96, onto Wixom Road, traveling North bound and could not find the object anywhere in the sky after our turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was cigar shaped and whitish in color.   It appeared to be slightly West of town, which is North-East of where we were, when we saw it.  It seemed to be hovering over Wixom, not moving.  We traveled a mile or so, watching it and trying to determine what it could be.  He spotted it first, miles before I saw it.  We were traveling at just under 70 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called my sister with a report of this incident.  She called our best friend and then, the Wixom Police Department, the WOMC (104.3 FM) radio station, finally, the National UFO Reporting Center.  She asked each of them to let her know if anyone else reports a sighting of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was instructed by the NUFORC to have each of us to sit down and independently write out our own reports of this sighing as soon as we returned home that evening.  We had company over the weekend, so this was my first opportunity to make my report of the incident.<n>

This object had a &#34;roiling&#34; surface, with the appearance of an orange fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was circular in shape, and looked as if molten metal was dripping off of its sides. This was quite dramatic, shocking to be candid. It was stationary, there was no noise whatsoever, the weather was calm, clear and warm, with no observable winds - and this object seemed to have a very deliberate purpose.  Now, this is just a strong mental impression I had, that was formed immediately, on the spot, in my head; as it was such a strong impression, it struck me as odd, alarming, and frighteningly real.  Frankly, I was too stunned to run inside to look for a camera, and stood outside staring at it for approximately 5 minutes, as I just could not believe my eyes yet at the same time I knew it was true - a very odd sensation. I had the strong impression that its purpose was quite deliberate, yet I have absolutely no idea what gave me that impression - the best I can describe is to say that it seemed to be very deliberate and bold in both its presence and appearance, above and beyon! d the shock value. Strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I was satisfied that I was NOT sleepwalking (something I have never done), not out of my mind or perhaps seeing things (so to speak), I ran inside to wake my wife to get her to see it as well.  By this time it was right at midnight, almost exactly. Normally she awakes quickly, but this night it was very hard to rouse her, taking a good 2 minutes to get her to awake and finally stumble out of bed. I rushed her outside to show her what I was seeing, and we arrived in time to see it for perhaps 5 more seconds, and then it suddenly shrank in size very quickly &amp; dramatically while at the same time appearing to travel directly away from us at an extremely rapid pace - literally disappearing from our sight almost instantly. It looked as if it disappeared into a slight cloud of smoke, though there was no real smoke present afterwards.  Odd, I know, I just cannot explain it any better, and am trying to give all details, as each of these impressions were so strong.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within roughly 15-20 minutes, 3 helicopters appeared along the mountain ridges where we live, and they maintained their presence non-stop over the next 3 days straight (though obviously in rotation for refueling, etc.) - since then, we see these choppers only from time to time, but in the same areas.  That night of our sighting, all we could see were the nav lights of the choppers, but during the days these helicopters looked like black unmarked units.  After the first night, there were never more than 2 helicopters in sight at any one time, and usually only one, though we could always hear at least one additional helicopter(s) over on the other side of the mountain ridge, which runs anywhere from less than one-half mile to perhaps 3/4 of a mile away from our house, and is easily visible in any weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our background is I am in my 60&#39;s, my wife in her 50&#39;s, we are professional and educated people.  I suppose for the sake of fairness I must also say that I have personally had a strong interest in UFO&#39;s for decades, and have spoken with many of the &#34;names&#34; in the &#34;industry&#34; - many of whom I consider to be either quacks or having a personal agenda, unfortunately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For many years we (my wife and I, and on occasion also a long-term friend we have known for the better part of 30 years) have studied the skies at night, and particularly in our area, we see strange things in the skies almost nightly - but they are usually at significant distances and high elevations.  However, I have studied this for enough years to have some ability to identify things like space debris, stars, rockets, &#34;shooting stars&#34;, planets, and their various behaviors, etc.  Some satellites and especially space debris (that loves to tumble and give the uninitiated incorrect impressions) can make you think you are seeing something else, so it takes a brutally honest mind, keen eyes, and long periods of time getting familiar with how to study and evaluate various objects in the night sky, especially before attempting to label something as potentially being &#34;not from this Earth&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw on the night of June 4th 2014 was not from this Earth, IMO.  I am familiar with most types of aircraft, both military and civilian, here in the USA and across most of Europe, and this round fireball has no peer in my personal experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have waited these past months looking for other similar reports from my area, and across the state, before finally deciding to report this experience tonight. I tried calling but because my home phone blocks outgoing Caller ID, your phone number will not take any such calls, completely negating the possibility of spoken communications. Rather disappointing after seeing you on TV a couple of years ago, the episode about you being a one-man operation, showing inside your office, showing you personally taking calls, etc. This I find to be a real issue, as I had wanted to speak in further detail about this, due to aspects I will not put in writing. Despite that, I sincerely thank you for your efforts, and want to wish you all the best with hopes that you will continue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We seem to be in a decent sized &#34;flap&#34; over much of 2014 here in Virginia, judging by talking to others and the reports here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps I will attempt to call you via y cell phone after the holidays so that we may have a conversation, if that is possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile, my wife &amp; I wish you a great New Year.<n>

It was an eerie heart-beating event, I&#39;ve never seen anything so astonishing in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also want to point out, there were many aircraft in the sky, less than a dozen had been spotted during the time of 10:30PM-11:05PM.

While I was looking up I heard a plane coming across, I looked up an noticed a white airplane flying (which is not normal for that time in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I thought  was odd (because I work on site at the airport and I know only restricted flights are flying.  So after watching this plane for a second&#34; I noticed a bright star getting closer to the plane.  I watched it and that bright star flew directly across the plane about 3,000 feet above  The star didn&#39;t make any noise like the plane had done as it passes over me seconds after crossing over the white plane.  I watched the star continue on its flight plan until I couldn&#39;t watch it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds after that, I dropped my keys while watching the craft,  I bent over in total darkness to find my keys!  And I heard 2 loud engine jets going across my home, but I couldn&#39;t see them because they were 2 fast and my tree was blocking the view while I was looking for the keys,<n> <n><n> <n><n> when I stood up the jets were gone<n>

It started to get a bit louder and kept going not like a passing car with a loose belt.  It seemed to fill the whole sky.  I got up and peered above my patio and realize the sound was right above me in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point it had a vibrato to it.  It was very strange and very different.  It vibrated in my ears like the sound a crystal glass makes when you run a finger around its wet rim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went inside and went to my boyfriend to ask him if he heard it.  You couldnt hear from inside.  Wasn&#39;t loud enough.  Then it just stopped.<n>

At first I thought it was a satellite; I could see it moving behind the spotty cloud cover at a steady pace.  But then it changed direction very suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my field of vision it had been moving right to left, angled slightly downward, but then it swooped a bit before traveling up.  After this it seemed to move in short spurts, and from the curve of travel seemed to be headed my way.  The pace seemed to even out as it neared Cassiopeia, vaguely towards the Big Dipper and soon out of sight, the exit path less than 90 degrees above where it was coming from when I saw it.  It was definitely faster than a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was giving me the creeps because it didn&#39;t fit with what I knew, so I went to turn on the computer (and make sure my shit was locked up) to reassure myself that it was a satellite.  It was still gone when I checked a half hour later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just looked like a normal star or satellite of medium brightness, but searching for moving stars isn&#39;t turning up anything but &#34;it&#39;s a UFO&#34;, so here I am.<n>

I was a little frightened realizing it is intentionally meant to not be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hesitated for 20 minutes to call 911.  But if someone else seen it then I would feel better about such a strange call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow 911 responded &#34;what is your emergency&#34;?.  I said it isn&#39;t an emergency but more a inquiry.  Has any one called about a dark large craft flying eastward no sound or lights?<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were understanding and asked shape and size.  I guessed on size and said about size of a football field but it was more size of a 18 wheeler.  I just got excited, I guess.<n>

I saw a fast moving object flashing, with a fairly regular pattern of two flashes in less than a quarter second, then a gap of about three quarters of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing a first pair of flashes, I concluded that the object was a fast moving airplane.  However, when the next pair of flashes began less than a second later, the object was moving in a completely different direction, perhaps about 135 degrees off from its original heading.  It didn&#39;t seem possible for an airplane to turn so quickly and completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashing light continued this rapid darting behavior, changing its heading seemingly almost at random with each pair of flashes.  After seeing each pair of flashes, I could roughly guess where the next would appear, but the position and particularly the heading would always surprise me somewhat when the next pair of flashes occurred.  It gave the impression of a pinball being bounced rapidly around by bumpers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the course of about 90 seconds, the object bounced its way to the West, and finally over to the Southern sky, where I lost it behind some trees.  There was no sound at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the sky closely for about 30 minutes thereafter, and I spotted the light twice more, after roughly five minutes intervals.  In both cases, I observed it near the big dipper where I had first seen it before, and in both cases I only had about 20 seconds to observe it before it went behind trees or my house.  However, there was one amazing pair of flashes (again, separated by less than a quarter second) when the object performed a complete 180 degree reversal between the two flashes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, I watched the sky with gradually decreasing attentiveness for about another hour, and I didn&#39;t see anything else of interest.  There were commercial airplanes in the sky off to the South while I was observing the flashing object, but they had no apparent interactions with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My impression was that the object was high up and far away, but I cannot rule out the possibility that it may have been closer, though it must have been at least above tree level, since it regularly disappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an amateur astronomer, I am highly familiar with the appearance and behavior of aircraft, satellites, and meteors in the night sky, and this phenomenon appeared to be none of these.<n>

I saw it first at about 22:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just happened to look up `and I saw almost directly over us headed then in a northerly direction a solid yellowish white light just kind of moving through the night sky.  It was the  brightest thing by far in the clear starlit sky which was complimented by a crescent moon to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The funny thing was that as soon as I spoke to point the object out to the three women who were standing outside with me, the bright light blinked out and the object now was indistinguishable from the surrounding stars except for the fact that it was moving at the same speed and heading North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the women said “a satellite?”  I said “I guess so, but it was really, really bright just a second ago...I mean really bright.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned back to the conversation about trees and bears and such things.  After about 10 minutes went by I looked up again there was another one or the same one?  Really, there is no way to tell.  But this time it kept its spot light intensity and seemed to slow as it passed directly over head (it felt kind of creepy as if it somehow may have seen us watching us- somehow) but it kept on moving due east at a speed which I described earlier as that which would equal approx 1/3 less than the international space station (ISS).  The four of us watched it as it silently flew?, floated?, drifted ? across the sky until it was lost in the eastern horizon.  No navigation lights no sound, just a yellowish white light about the size of a soft ball when held at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have no idea what it was, what it was doing or where it was from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon returning home I went to the computer and looked up the time when the ISS would be flying over the area.  I found that it was scheduled to fly over Caribou Maine at approx 00:30 which is about 15 miles away as the crow flies so there is no way that it was the ISS that we saw at 22:45.<n>

While getting fire started, I was along outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the fire got going, I sat down to relax.  After about ten minutes, I had the strangest sensation that someone was looking at me.  I looked to my right and I saw this orb which was white in color, the same color as a star.  I would say their size was about the size of a softball, maybe as big as a basketball.  Hard to tell.  However, this orb wasn&#39;t a celestial body as it was maybe only 100 feet above my trees running down the property line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was static for approx. 30 seconds as I initially observed it.  While looking at it, I was trying to figure out what it could have been.  Then after half a minute, the object started pulsing (bright, gone, bright, gone) and began moving erratically over my property, changing altitude, direction, and velocity.  It emitted no sound at all that was perceivable to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I ran in the house and got my friends to come outside and observe.  We could not identify the phenomenon, however, one friend offered  up that they could be fireflies. This was the closest explanation, however it failed to explain the color (object(s) were bright white, not greenish-yellow), nor the speed at which they were able to traverse the sky (very quickly as to meandering around).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We  then began seeing other orbs spontaneously appearing in the night sky, and they began to fly in formation.  The maneuvers would then break off in different directions and start kind of behaving randomly again.  An orb would appear in a place in the sky, disappear, then pop up in another location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pulsing of the light was not static either.  Sometimes they would strobe faster, other times they would appear to flicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to photograph them, but they did not appear in the digital photographs, which  was odd because they were much more luminous than the regular celestial objects appearing in the night sky.  In total there were four of us obs! erving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was also using binoculars to see them upclose, however, I was unable to make out any shape or physical form as the light they emitted was intense and not translucent.  At one point, I believe I heard a helicopter nearby, and wondered if they were seeing this.  There was also a jet aircraft moving quite fast and flying low which came out of nowhere and was traveling in the direction that the orbs were present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several of them shot up vertically to the flight&#39;s altitude and got very close to the aircraft.  Immediately proceeding this event, the sky seemed to be brimming with these objects flying in formation in groups of two&#39;s or three&#39;s, disappearing, and then emerging way across the sky in the same flight path in another location.  It seemed to me that they were &#34;jumping&#34; almost.  Very weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the phenomena had stopped for about an hour, I was outside and had this thought to myself that was something like, &#34;Wow, I wish I could see them one more time, it was so cool&#34; and immediately, as if on cue, one was literally at the tree tops in my back yard right above my head.  The object seemed to persist until I finally called it a night and went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No further sightings since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend said that the color at times appeared slightly orangish, but I can say that I definitely did not see any orange, or any other color, except pure white.<n>

To me it looked like the top of the tree was on fire but it was just glowing above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction was to get my phone out an film but when I clicked on the video to record my phone would not record an then all off the sudden my phone went to 95% battery life to 1% in just seconds and then it died.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So while we were watching it, it shot a light down onto the ground in between the trees an when the light hit the ground it made like a round base circle of light on the ground that was multiple of colors (white, red, blue, orange and green).  It was very weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So my girlfriend got really scared because we had our 2 year old son in the back.  He was starring at the lights an pointing.  So she wanted to leave so we got in our car an it wouldn&#39;t start as if the battery on our car went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t even turning over so I tried to turn my phone on to call my brother in law to give me a jump but it was dead so we tried her phone an that was dead too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were in the car the light or beam slowly went back up into the craft right as it was gone the light on the craft dimmed out an I could see the figure of it.  It was a round disc that was that seemed to have 3 layers of it that were rotating right to left and left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend was so scared that she grabbed my pistol, so I grabbed it an popped a shot off not towards the craft but on the ground an it&#39;s lights turned back on an right before it took off it was really weird because when I saw it there were no windows at all none.  Then after I popped a warning shot I saw 5 windows an I could see the out line of multiple figures and then it just shot up into the sky heading towards Lake Tahoe towards heavenly ski resort.  I have seen lights in the sky all the time but this was just very disturbing I don&#39;t get scared of anything an this had me a little frighten I guess that&#39;s why I popped a shot off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the craft left out car started and we left back home with my girlfriend really scared.  I just got my phone charged that&#39;s why I&#39;m filling out the report so late.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please if anyone who was coming down the hill that night saw it too please report it or if you know what it was please post what it is on the nuforc website.  I know there was 2 cars pulled over when I was leaving so please report it.  Is this a new military aircraft?  I would really like a answer please so I can put myself an my girlfriend&#39;s mind at ease.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he assures us that the report is sincere and accurate.

It was moving relatively slowly as well.  I witnessed this outside of my home window, while watching tv.  The object stayed in sight, for about a minute before it disappeared behind a tree line.  The object didn&#39;t have any flashing lights, that would indicate it as being a commercial or military flight.

I noticed 2 lights in the sky off to my left and it caught my attention because they  We&#39;re sitting still just above the tree line.  We were sitting outside on the nursing home patio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my mother and we watched the two lights as they became progressively smaller and disappeared into the clouds.  The 2 lights were white in colour and only small dots visually speaking from what appeared to be a good distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t really give it much thought because the dots of light were not large or distinguishable.  However, when I left the nursing home at about 10:23pm I saw another orb of light coming from the opposite direction.  This light was very large and was a pinkish gold ball of light that was very intense.  There was sparks dripping falling off of the bottom of it. I surprisingly watched it as it went from right to left...slowing down and even coming to a full stop a few times at least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was rich and brilliant deep pink/gold.  It looked like pure energy.  I wasn&#39;t as afraid as I was curious.  Visually it was the size of a baseball and it looked very close stopping in front of me even.  Never would have believed it...it had sparks falling straight down from the bottom as if liquid...so odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not stopped thinking about it since I saw it...  I wasn&#39;t afraid although I probably should have been...

I left my house with a friend around dusk.  I was driving down Vint Hill Road due North toward Manassas, VA.  My friend looked out the passenger window and made a comment about some cows in a field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then turned the music up and continued to drive.  As we came to an area in the road where you have to slow down for a sharp curve, my friend made a comment about something he saw hovering over in the field out the right window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked over I noticed bright lights about 100- 150 yds. in the air and 1000-1500 ft. away. I immediately slowed to a stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put my hazard lights on starring at the object. It was sitting in the air almost motionless just hovering.  I then turned the music down and proceeded to tell my friend to record the flying object.  For about 15 to 30 seconds it stayed in one spot above the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object slowly moved almost effortlessly in my direction, my friend began recording.  It stayed completely level, not moving up or down just in a straight line toward my vehicle.  I could make out the details of the saucer-like shape.  It had individual bright blue circular lights wrapping around the center of a metallic silver reflective surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was in shock and disbelief of what I was witnessing.  So entranced by the gleaming lights and saucer, I was completely oblivious if any cars were going to rear end me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, it just stopped less the 200 yds. away from my vehicle.  At this point it started slowly spinning.  Now knowing exactly what I was witnessing, I felt it time to leave as quickly! as possible.  Looking back within seconds of me continuing down the road.  I looked back and the object was no longer there anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I immediately scanned the sky around us and it was gone.<n>

The weather conditions were clear at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on the front porch of my house, which faces to the North.  I happened to look to the west and I saw a bright red light traveling at a slow rate of speed in a downward trajectory, almost as if it were coming straight at me.  Then it seemed to level off and made very subtle movements left to right, almost unnoticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued to travel in a easterly direction and no longer towards me.  The brightness of the light never gained or lost brightness as one would expect of an airplane traveling in the night sky.  Also there was no sound coming from this object that was traveling at an altitude that normal aircraft would fly at.  I can not say how high up in the sky it was, as it was night and my ability to judge distance is not as good as it would be during the day.  But if I had to guess, I would say that it was at a height of maybe 5,000 to 7,000 feet, but that is only a guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this object was now traveling in and easterly direction it started to make a slow arc to the South East, and began to travel over my house.  I watched the object and I noticed that the color and brightness of the light did not dim or change one bit as it passed over my location, as one would expect with a normal aircraft.  I continued to watch the object and after it passed over my house it traveled for a bit more then seemed to stop and not move one bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house at this time and tried to find something that I could take a picture with, realizing that I did not have time to do this I went back outside.  The time I was in the house was maybe less the 30 seconds.  The object was no where to be seen. I have good visibility around my house so I would have been able to see it traveling had it started to move again.  The rate of speed that it had been traveling had been slow as if it were a helicopter, not fast at all.  I looked and looked all around bout could not find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure I will never see anything like this again in my life and I wish I had had the ability to film it.  I have been around aircraft all my life.  I have flown myself, and my father was a pilot, with an A &amp; P license.   My uncle had flown all his life, and was the founder of the Fire Mountain Squadron of the Civil Air Patrol here in Lewis county, and also my mother&#39;s husband had retired from the Air Force and had flown with the Thunderbird&#39;s after Viet-Nam.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the Army and have flown in numerous helicopters.<n>

The knocks were loud enough that I woke up with quite a start, and sat straight upright in bed.  Wide awake, my eyes were open and the walls were moving in a wavy sort of way.  I noticed the window sills bending and twisting.  I was a bit weirded out, but figured my eyes were adjusting to having just come directly out of a very vivid dream state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at my ceiling fan and it was fading in and out of darkness, like what one might see when you are about to faint when you stand up too fast.  Also I notice my hearing is super super keen.  I can hear the refrigerator humming in the kitchen and other sounds that I think are the house settling.  There is slight banging and knocking sounds and its almost as if I can tell from exactly what direction each noise is coming from in the house, I imagine its like how a bat must hear.  I am also feeling like I am not alone in the house, like something is there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My small hairs are standing on end at this point.  I&#39;m sitting upright in bed still, my eyes not focusing and feeling like I&#39;m having an acid flashback of some sort, fear is setting in, and after a couple of minutes sitting there, my eyes still aren&#39;t adjusting.  I cover one eye with one hand, hoping I will help focus them and do the same with the other eye, nothing changes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look out the north east window, and see 2 bright stars, swirling and dancing with each other and realize that my vision is quite messed up, I am freaked out and decide I need air.   So I get out of bed, iphone in hand (because I&#39;m more frightened than I have ever been in my life and I might need to call someone) and walk to the west facing windows, which look out over a valley that the village of Jackson is in.  As I am looking out the window, thinking of opening it, I notice the stars in the sky are all perfectly in focus, no swimming or blurring, just perfect wide sky-the two white lights to the northeast that I saw while I was still in my bed- they are still &#39;dancing&#39; with one another.  Then an orange, steady light comes into view from the south west, about as high as a regular plane would fly, but orange- non blinking.  It travels relatively slowly across the sky- STOPS for about 15 seconds- starts moving again at its original speed in a different direction- STOPS AGAIN- starts moving after a short 5 second pause, then proceeds to fly out of sight beyond the treeline by my house.  As I am watching the orange light move across the sky, I text a friend who lives up the street @ 1:11 am:  &#34;Look out your window UFOs in Jackson sky!&#34;  Why I didn&#39;t film it-I don&#39;t know-I was super scared and remember considering doing it, but had the distinct feeling that it might piss someone off or wouldn&#39;t be the right thing to do.  I am more scared than ever in my life at this point and decide I need to go out and be with other people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I turn to head to the garage and hear sounds in my house.  I am freaked and realize I cant run from this, that going outside might not be a good idea either, so I close my bedroom door, look in the closet for whatever is in the house, and climb into bed- turn on my relaxing music to drown out the sounds in the house, pull the covers over my head and bury myself in pillows and fall asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wake up same as always 4:30 am, feeling calm and rested.  I remember everything clear as a bell.  I walk thru the sun lit house, checking all the doors and closets to make sure no one is in the house.  I go about my day, pondering the night before, my rational mind going over everything, making excuses about what I heard and saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the end of the day, I have everything rationalized, explained logically, EXCEPT the 3 knocks.  So I google it &#39;3 knocks at night&#39; and the first website that pops up,of course, has an alien on the homepage~~~&amp;gt; creepy shivers!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I take a shower before work, look for any strange marks on my body- none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s the end of the story I hope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember seeing any other worldly beings, I was not hurt in any way- just terrified.<n>

Weird never seen that before, maybee a satellite,  I don&#39;t know but it wasn&#39;t a plane cause I&#39;m close to the airport so I know what they look like, once again same color and size of a bright star that u would see in the every night sky, its very clear out right now too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Star sighting??

I immediately saw a triangle shaped bay of solid non-pulsating non-flashing red lights.  The object appeared to be triangular in shape but was not well illuminated.  The object appeared to be 500 to 1000 feet over the end of her street (approximately 100 yds. south of my position).  It was slowly moving towards my position.  There was no noise, no odor, no sensation of heat or any other perception other than the visual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called for her to hurry and come out of the garage.  This took her approximately 45 sec. to 1 min.  During that period of time the object pivoted 120 degrees towards the southeast and up-angled at about 60 degrees.  It silently accelerated away in that direction.  My girl friend came out of the garage and videoed a point of red light moving away.  She only saw the object once it was so distant that the three lights could only be distinguished as one. We watched the object disappear up and away from us.  The whole incident took 3 to 5 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ask her neighbor and friend, who is a state police officer, if this was perhaps a drug plane using infrared.  He stated they do use infrared but it is not visible.  Meigs County across the river is infamous for growing marijuana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have since been told that several other people in the neighboring town of Hartford saw something similar but I don&#39;t know their names.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Mason County airport is about 15 miles south of where this occurred in Point Pleasant, WV.<n>

Aprx 1/2 mile past Englewood. A bright white light to the left of my sight above the neighborhood, caught my attention. I figured it was an air plane at first but after getting a clear look noticed that the light was quite wide and extremely white like an led but huge, and also very low and moving at maybe 2-3 mph but did have a red and blue light on each corner &#34;shoulder?&#34;.  I pulled over to see if I could get a better look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At which time it rotated its position to its right and I could see its form better and it kinda tilted downward pointing its light angled at the houses appearing to scan or scout the neighborhood.  It was triangular in shape kinda difficult to explain.  The best was I can explain it, tho it may sound rediculous, is it looked &#34;transformerish&#34; no wings or propellers at all. It was completely silent.  Maybe a govt machine or something idk it was prob 15ft wide by 20ft tall.  80ft off the! ground.  Never seen anything like it befote.  Wondering if anyone else seen this or similar...<n>

Not a orb or a lantern.  It had no solid shape as far as I could tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it drift sideways and it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I&#39;m standing at the window texting my friends about this freaky thing I saw, it came again at 10:45PM.  Exactly the same type of object moving exactly the same way along the same path until it vanished in exactly the same area as the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood there for another hour and saw nothing but planes high in the sky circling the area that I saw this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They left no trail and didn&#39;t move up or down, just sideways.<n>

Southwest of my position and over the water of Lake Ontario, I witnessed a group of seven slow moving aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guessed their speed to be comparable to that of ultralight aircraft.  I judged them to be at a distance of less than five miles and approximately two thousand feet in the air.  Their shape was not immediately discernable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Six of them were spaced evenly at approximately two hundred feet apart horizontally, with uneven variances in elevation of possibly 100 feet.  The seventh was flying alone at a similar altitude but following the formation at a distance of roughly 1 km.  They were distinguishable at this time only by a crisp, bright circular orange light representing each craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they moved slowly through the sky, I judged them to be flying in a South to Northwest direction.  As they traversed an angle of approximately 70 degrees from my position, I saw the orange light flicker and disappear from each craft beginning with the lead vehicle.  At this time I speculated that this was because the light was projecting forward from each vehicle, and as the vehicles passed by, the source of light was not visible from my angle of observation.  Because the western sky was still relatively bright at this time of night, I was able to discern the shape of each vehicle in silhouette.  All of them appeared to be perfectly round in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound was discernable from any of the craft at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local trees began to obscure my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total observation time was less than two minutes.<n>

The craft then hovered over an area nearby.  The craft approached with a golden glow, however when it began to hover it changed to different colors of the rainbow.  It went from an indigo color to aqua, to green to yellow, yellow to orange, and orange to red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes of hovering over the same area it appeared to fly away but it appeared as it was landing at the same time because the light was the same brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several of the witnesses tried to record the sighting on their phone, but the object did not show up on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve always had a suspicion UFOs are real, but having other witnesses by my side assured me that I’m not crazy.<n>

At one point I noticed that the formed a nice oval, at that point the brightest one was red and in the middle... they were traveling South.  I posted on Facebook to see if anyone else noticed but I got no response so far. By the time I was able to take a picture they were far and almost invisible, I will send it to you anyway, if you can take a look at it the cluster is in the very middle of it.<n>

The object was spherical with lights around its middle very clearly visible.  It changed many times it&#39;s attitude, meaning it seemed to tip and the lights were at one point close to vertical, then it would right itself and the lights that were around it were again horizontal.  This was witnessed by myself and five other adults that were nearby, all agreed that what we were witnessing matched the description given above.  It was visible for nearly 30-40 minutes.  It moved in northwesterly direction until it was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No drugs or alcohol had been used by any of the witnesses...well except one!<n>

I was seated in a window seat approx. 6 rows in front of the wing at that time.  Around 15 minutes prior to landing (NE approach), I noticed an unidentified object in the sky, while viewing the landscape below.  We were still several thousand feet off the ground (houses were approx. 5mm in size) at this time.  The object appeared to be stationary and approximately 1000 feet below us and to the left of the plane.  It consisted of a cluster of round metallic objects making up the top half of the craft, which via a circular midsection joined an elongated four sided pyramid as the bottom half.  All areas of the craft were silver and reflective in nature.  The top half can best be described as if you created a larger sphere out of adjoining smaller spheres.  This top half was not elongated or billowing in the wind as a weather ballon might do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the object for approx. 5 seconds, as my plane passed by.  My view of the object was excellent.  There were no clouds in the sky, and I could see multiple details of the craft.  I did not note any vapors or heat waves emanating from the craft.  After we left the craft behind, I began scanning objects on the ground to reference the crafts size.  My best guess is comparing it to a semi truck while we were 600 ft above it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Others may have seen this craft but no one said anything on the flight.  Unfortunately we passed by too quick to take a picture, but I am 100% certain of what I saw.<n>

So shiny, that the reflection of the sun, made me blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came to a stop two or more times, back tracked and then headed east very slowly.  It must have came closer, because I could see clearly that it was a disk and not an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Excited, I asked my Son to run and get our camera.  When he came back I had lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched it for at least 4 minutes, before I asked for the camera.<n>
