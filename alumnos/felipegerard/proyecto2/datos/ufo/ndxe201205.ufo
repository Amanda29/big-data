We noticed a white colored star-like light in the northeast sky towards the direction of Greensburg.  It was as bright as Venus and was moving in our direction.  Oddly, the light would flicker at times, staying bright for several seconds and then gradually losing luminosity until it was barely noticeable, and return back to brightness once again.  This occurred a few times. A few minutes later, as we continued talking about it, the light simply vanished without a trace.  There were breaks in the clouds that night so it should still have been noticeable as it passed above the clouds and back into open view.  Location of sighting was in the Fort Allen neighborhood, near Hempfield Area High School.<n>

For the past month I&#39;ve been observing diffrent types of helicopters ,iam only aware of one chopper  Operated by the durham police department.  I&#39;ve had seen three black helicopters almost like special ops ,a plain white one was also seen all together flying north east off the four corners .  A week after that I seen a black jet with no markings flying at a high rate of speed in the same direction as the choppers towards the canadian shield .  Which brings us to todays sighting ,at aprox,3:45am I was outside having a smoke. Looking up (north to north east ) I seen something that looked like a star but it was moving.  Then I thought it may be a satelite. It had stopped I call for my partner to come see the u.f.o. we then observed it excellerate at a high rate of speed only to stop it seemed at or beside a star. It then moved  up down then side to side.  Then it moved in the direction of the other aircraft I described earlier in prior weeks (north to north east) in a quick but not high rate if speed .we both waited awile to see if any other activity would happen. .after waiting for 30 min. we had stoped  looking .<n>
5/31/12 00:30|Praia (Santiago) (Cape Verde Islands)||Oval|1 hour|I am writing this letter in order to submit the sighting form with regard to my observations.  I was away on vacation in the Cape Verde|6/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89322.html|7|ndxe201205| I am writing this letter in order to submit the sighting form with regard to my observations.  I was away on vacation in the Cape Verde islands on the island of Santiago from May 23, 2012 to June 1, 2012/.  The area of the island I was staying was very quiet and desolate, facing the ocean and a near by Island was visible off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of May 30, 2012, I was admiring the moon and how it appeared to have set into the ocean.  The stars were very visible and abundant.  A friend and I noticed one particular star that appeared to be glowing and moving as if on an axis.  While noticing this &#34;star&#34;, we observed an orange strobe moving toward that &#34;star.&#34;  The orange strobe was pointed out as an airplane by my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This orange strobe was moving faster than a plane given the distance away.   As it approached the &#34;star,&#34; the orange strobe circled around it, the &#34;star&#34; appeared to move, and the orange strobe vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were puzzled and we called to another friend to come outside and view the &#34;star.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> While calling a third friend to come outside, a very bright light appeared in the sky and moved faster than anything I had ever seen.  If the &#34;star&#34; was at 1 o’clock on an imaginary clock in the sky, then this very bright light I believed was a shooting star, was at 12 o’clock.  This event was so bright and so fast that it startled me and my friend.  This occurred around 0030 hours Cape Verde time, which is 3 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While still noticing this &#34;star&#34; appearing to be on an axis and moving, we observed another orange light, appearing to be blinking.  This orange strobe moved from 1 o’clock to about 5 o’clock over about 10 minutes.  I had time to go inside the residence, running, to get a camera with the hopes of capturing a photograph or a video.  I retrieved the camera but based on its low quality, it could not capture my observations.   The orange strobe vanished after being viewed for approximately 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A third orange strobe was located and observed travelling from left to right in the same area and height but from 1 o’clock to only about 3 before vanishing.  The first strobe described above was viewed travelling from right to left and vanished after circling near the &#34;star.&#34;  This &#34;star&#34; was located in the area where the moon was last seen before it set into the ocean.  This &#34;star&#34; was also located in the area where the neighboring island was visible during the daylight hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point, we observed another flash of light and or shooting star.  From where we were standing, this occurred directly above us at the center of the sky.  This was not nearly as bright as the first event described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These events had me absolutely sure that the objects I could see were not airplanes.  I believed this is the first time in my life that I have ever witnessed a UFO, or several.  The activity in this area was unlike anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spoke to a pilot who works out of Praia International Airport who stated that there are no airplanes that should be travelling at that altitude at that time.  I attempted to research the FAA to research any flights in the area during these hours but was unsuccessful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that you can shed some information on what I may have observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  ((name deleted))<n>

I looked out the window to see if it was the moon when I saw a very large bright white light suspended in the air.  It was so bright I had to keep looking away because it was hurting my eyes.  It was stationary and would occasionally flash its lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it several minutes then the bright light shut off and it flew away to the left (West).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point about five smaller lights came from behind the tree line and followed in a line the same path the larger light took.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought someone had launched some sort of lanterns or lights, but the objects began moving apart and then quickly started moving East towards Sacramento (fairly fast).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over so I could have a closer look.  The objects were fairly low just above the treeline and the ojects had a very bright orange color.  They were clearly not an aircraft as their movement away from eachother was non linear.  There were no sounds present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything similar in this town before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As I was walking toward the corral I looked up and noticed an array of what appeared to be white, blue, and red strobe lights. (much like a light bar on a police car) I have seen it before and reported it to this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was making my way back to the house, I continued to observe the strobes which began to move south to north at a slow rate of speed, and stopped after traveling a short distance.  As it began to move, it left behind a VERY bright white light which remained on for 3 to 5 seconds, it did not move but was extinguished, a slight after glow was visible for another 10 to 15 seconds.  The strobe array was still there when I went indoors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reminded me of a truck at an intersection, driving past a motorcycle with its brights on.<n>

My neighbor and I were on the patio, when she spotted the first ball of fire.  It looked like an airplane on fire, and we were waiting for it to fall from the sky.  It moved at the speed of the International Space Station when it makes it pass across the sky.  The object moved rather slowly, and appeared to stop in the sky.  It then moved more to the South, and slowly disappeared into the distant.  Moments later, another one appeared.  It too followed the same path, same speed.  And it also appeared to stop, before disappeared straight out into the clouds.   These balls were bright orange in color, and really looked like balls of fire.<n>

I beging counting again but there were  only these three cylinder shaped objects.  The third (and final)  cylinder had what looked like a red light or something red that  appeared very bright on top.  All three objects were same shape and  size and very shiney silver.  There were no wings, no noise, no  flashing lights.

It was 19:30, so the sun was setting, but there was still plenty of light. We saw what we thought was an airplane flying over.  It was flying fairly low, an we realized that it had no wings. We continued to watch it &amp;quot;disappeared&amp;quot; behind the trees(it did not disappear, but flew into an area where we could no longer see it).  The body of the craft was cigar-shaped, but had a divot near the front that seemed to extend around its entire diameter.  There was no exhaust or trail extending behind it, and it made no noise. It looked to be about the size of a large, jet airplane.  I am not sure how far up in the sky it was flying, but it was low enough to see some details.  It appeared to be a shiny, aluminum color.<n>
5/30/12 04:25|Tempe|AZ|Unknown|Second|Object with fiery tail shot off into the sky|6/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89321.html|17|ndxe201205| Object with fiery tail shot off into the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed dawn was just starting to fall upon the area as I looked out through my patio doors. I was looking north through two French doors, which face east, and saw an object with an ENE or NE trajectory shoot off into the sky just above the tree line.  It looked rather similar to a meteor or firework with a very bright and rather thick orange, fiery tail (which had a bright orangish-yellow band within its core) that tapered out roughly 30 feet from the object itself. It was not a meteor, however, due to the fact that its trajectory was upward (as opposed to towards the ground); it shot into the sky at about a 45 degree angle.  I&#39;m positive it was not a firework; its tail was an extremely vivid, almost fluorescent orange, unlike anything I&#39;ve seen before.   The air was still and dead silent. Its path was also slightly arched, which seemed to mimic the shape of a nearby tree canopy&#39;s silhouette. My view was obstructed by a few trees, but I got a clear shot of th! e object through a pocket of clear space between trees.   I was not able to see the object that produced the fiery tail, however, as it was much smaller than the tail itself, and traveled away much too quickly.  It seemed to be rather close though; between 50-200 yards away and only 40-60 feet off the ground.   And though I cannot say with 100% certainty, I also feel the object disappeared when I lost sight of it (as opposed to me losing visibility); it just vanished, much like shooting stars do as they fall toward the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred near sky harbor airport, beneath incoming/outgoing flight lines, yet at this early hour no incoming red-eye planes were present. The roads were quiet as well.<n>

So I looked in the direction he was pointing and seen an orange fireball in the sky.  We could see it at level to the tree lines through the trees in the sky.  It was a round fireball.  It was not moving, just sitting in one place and did not move as far as we know.  It may have been there for a while longer we just noticed it as we woke up.  Then after looking at it for about 4 mins it just went out, nothing.  Like it just blinked out.  We live on a hill and it was facing out through the trees overlooking the town.  Before this happened a few weeks ago, have been seeing other strange things, hearing strange noises, and all different types of strange occurances.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We didnt need much light at that moment because of the moonlight above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking we came within 10-15 yards to three bipedal creatures that made very rapid clicking sounds.

I went outside to have a cigarette, and I looked up at the stars, turned my head down and looked up again, and an extremely white light was shining-for example, say the stars are a size of a dime, and this light was the size of a grapefruit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It lasted only about 10-15 seconds, and then slowly diminished.  It did not move right or left or up and down; after it disappeared an aura remained that was rather light bluish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was it an exploding star, I have no idea, other than it was remarkable-the brightness was crystal white, brightness I have never seen before.  It was round with feathered light near the outside; hard to explain.  I was stunned and shocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked out images of exploding stars on the web and there are a few that resemble what I saw-the bright white intense light.

Approximately 10:35 PM, weather was  cloudy  with some sprinkles of rain. Observer was driving in westerly direction, slightly uphill on Highland Blvd near Bozeman Deaconess hospital.  The string of lights, approximately seven to eight round, orange objects in Western sky over Bozeman were moving at a steady, not overly rapid pace toward southeast.   Observer then  drove to top of hill just north of blue water tower above Highland Blvd to listen for sounds.  Objects were silent.   Not positive as to exact number of objects due to driving a car and some objects had moved into clouds.  At least two objects were ahead of  a linear formation of 4 or more objects with one larger sphere trailing more slowly.   All objects disappeared into overhead clouds and once in the clouds,  no lighted objects! were seen although the moon in high, slightly southwest location was a very diffuse white light behind clouds.  Object  speed was similar to a motorized hang glider but without sound, and moved in a steady linear fashion.   No planes were heard in the area although major airline jet was seen approaching from east to airport (approximately 10:38 pm) with obvious bright white landing lights.    Initial thought was objects appeared to be a string of outdoor orange Christmas lights.<n>

However, the rain had let up at this point and the light didn’t flash like lightening. It stayed for a few seconds and then disappeared. Also, it was accompanied by a sound that was a low, deep humming or whirring that faded in and out each time the light appeared and disappeared.  My mind started racing with possibilities so when it happened again, I thought it could be a car in a cul-de-sac behind us but the sound and the light didn’t match that scenario either.  I jumped out of bed when it happened a third time and far to the left, right above the tree line, I saw a very large and very bright green light the color of the green on a stop light.  It seemed very close. I yelled for my husband to come look but it was gone by the time he woke up.  The light didn’t show again and there were no other sounds associated with it.  I’ve been searching for a plausible answer as to what it was but there is none.<n>

The sun had already come up. I could see the horizon of Buffalo and noticed a very dark, odd looking, little rain cloud hovering low above the city, directly above the shortest of the cities three water towers and as high as the tallest.  The cloud was as wide as the town, which has a population of a little over 3,000 people.  It had been storming during the night but this strange cloud was the only one left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly I watched as at least two (possibly a third on the far side) gigantic triangular shaped craft emerged from the north side (toward me) but pointing west.  The front one was about twice as big as the rear object. Both were the biggest aircraft i&#39;ve ever seen, including a few stealth bombers.  They were black in color however the rear one never fully emerged and I never got a clear view of the bottom.  However I could tell that they we! re both pulsating a light from their centers.  The cloud seemed to cloak them both and the light strobed in the color of the very dark, almost black cloud, back to nothing, to dark cloud.  The light emitted looked like a tractor beam from a movie for a better visual reference.  The two crafts seemed to actually be one craft possibly as they were connected in the middle by what looked like piping.  Both seemed and covered in athe haze.  The cloud acted in the most unnatural way, wrapping around the craft as if it was pulling it back in, or the craft was pulling the cloud around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I honestly didn&#39;t believe what i was seeing and looked down.  When I looked up it was still there, so I pulled over to find my phone that was in the back to try to take a video.  When I finally found it the entire slow moving cloud, not just the craft,  was gone.  I only saw it for at most 45 seconds, the entire incident only lasting 2 minutes. And thats the end of it. I will be emailing an illustration a! nd a map within the next day or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke by telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.

The object flashed a light back at my friend and I.  The object shined a light at us four separate times while moving across the sky.  The object quickly was out of view and nothing further happened after.

The sighting went on for about 90 minutes and then it went away.  It would move sideways left to right, hovering in the air about 30 to 35 feet. It was a cloudy night, we had rain earlier.

They sort of resembled the Big Dipper&#39;s bowl (without the handle).  They appeared to be red stars at first, but they started to move and begin to &#39;fade&#39; behind the clouds.  It was as though they were working in one accord.  Another light appeared a small distance from where they were.  It became brighter as it moved upwards into the sky and faded.  This action was repeated around five times.  From what I observed, these lights were moving in a geometric pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with some people when we saw these lights.  One person called another individual whom was across town and told them about the lights.  This individual, along with whoever was with them had the pleasure of seeing these lights also.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was yet to sleep on the top of my house. I was watching stars in the dark blue night sky. (not black or no heavy clouds). I suddenly noticed a black triangular object with three triangular white lights at its corners.  The white glow of the lights is homogenous similar to artificial satellites, but not irregular as how the moon appears. I mean that the light emitted at the 3 corners is plane.  It was neither too far nor near for my vision, but the black triangular object with its edges clearly separated its vision from the dark blue sky. (Bluish black sky).  Heading to North-west on Nallapadu near Guntur in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India it remained clear for 6- 8 seconds and disappeared for my vision.  Size of appearance is the size of a helicopter at heights of 2.5- 3.5 kilometers, I guess.  Just Completed bachelors program in aeronautical engineering, I was clear what I noticed in the sky with a clear eye-si! ght (21 year old).  I confirmed it was not an airplane as it is in triangular shape and also makes no audible sound.  I confirmed it was not a group of 3 white coloured birds as the lights appeared are homogeneous and triangular and by the black triangular edge, shows it was a single object.  Nothing more special I noticed.<n>

They were hovering and moving very slowly to the east.  It looked like a large airplanes headlights coming towards us but it was moving to the side so it was clearly not an airplane.  They then began moving rapidly across the horizon staying perfectly spaced apart then slowed again to a creeping pace and went behind trees so I could not see them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I drove a few miles away towards my own house I saw the objects again in the same orientation but much farther away, maybe even 100 miles because they were much smaller but clearly the same lights. I lost sight again over the horizon.  I got to my house and went up the hill nearby so I could get a better view.  By the time I gained sight of them they were twice as far as when I had seen them less than 5 minutes earlier.  I observed them for around 10 more minutes and during that time they had split apart and were miles away from each other on the horizon.  They were moving up and down slightly and they were also flashing red and white rapidly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD))<n>

So I went out at 10:00 and started to water when a few more very loud firecrakers went off.  I could see the reflection of them in my neighbors window.  Then as I turned around to shut the hose off I noticed a silet orange small fireball float by.  I thought it might have been an ember from the earlier firework still floating by but it never came to the ground and floated between my house and the neighbors appoximately 4-5 stories high and headed north over the neighborhood and then I lost sight.  What is strange about this is that on the 4th of July, two years in a row, at roughly the same time, I have seen the same thing floating by in the same general direction, and although I was alone tonight both of those two time their were many neighbors out who witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The red and blue light turned green white red purple bluish reddish blue greenish orange and it was way impressible so i ignored it as i remember there is a park right there, a school park so i though to my self its a RCA electric hovering UFO like seen on TV or internet, well i started to notice it started to change color with more intensity and moving from one place to an other really fast, and at very long distances all to quick for it to bee a balloon or RCA (electric radio controlled UFO) i just freaked out and i didn&#39;t event bother waking  up my dad to ask for his video camera.  After freaking out i was just thinking about the colored high intense light winch had small and big sizes as it moved when hovering, thinking of that that light was relaxing, like fireworks but UFO sh.the object never really changed shape only when it started to move like i have never even seen on the internet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It slowly drifted upward. Kind of like a balloon would float up.  We watched them for about a half an hour with no major changes and then had to come in for the night.  I&#39;ve never seen that before but it scared me a little because my daughter told me about 2 weeks ago, she was woken up by the sound of a jet and looked out to see a red &amp;quot; fireball moving harizontally across the sky and I told her it was probably just a falling star, but now I wonder....<n>

He ran upstairs and we watched it together.  The red light started to dim and then slowly faded completely.We could still see the darkness of the craft,i threw open the window and could hear no motor or any type of small engine sounds coming from that area in the sky.It then slowly moved out of my line of sight and disappeared.I then ran downstairs and outside the backdoor,down on the lawn so we could! see better.  It was around 5 minutes standing outside waiting when almost ready to go inside because of biting misquitoes when another red light very similar to the first light appeared in the same area as when i saw the first one. This object looked brighter and moved very similar but the light stayed consistant this rime never fading,it was almost cigar shaped like a torch but then became smaller and more cylyndrical like a circle.We watched until it slowly and methodically disappeared westward towards the horizon.It was less than 5 minutes again when appeared in the same vacinity as the first two,a massive bright torchlike shaped cigar which was 10 times brighter than the first two.Following very close near that location was an immense bright &amp;quot;white&amp;quot; light from a mid-sized what appeared to be a military plane headed towards my direction,toward the military base-Offutt/Space-Strat Com. Bellevue,Nebraska.The red object then floated slowly and traveled in a similar ! pattern as the first two,it traveled this slow pattern again h! eading w estward toward the horizon.These lights seemed to be individual separate lights.Never blinking or flashing just the first mentioned which faded then re-appeared.I think it was probably a military test craft or drone,just my opinion but I wanted to make sure i wrote this report as quickly as I saw it asap.Thank you.<n>

It got to about 25% of the size of the moon. Then about 5 to 8 min latter just a little to the East it happened again just not as big, but just as bright and it did not last as long. Any one else see it, can anyone tell me what it was.  Also, I saw the same thing last Wednesday night (May 23) in the North Eastern sky, this one was a little more orange.  But what caused me to write about it and search for an answer for what I was, each had no tall. It was just a burst of light.  Like in the meteor fall that leaves a tail showing the direction of the fall, these all had no tails, no streaks? What is it, anyone know?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

My son asked me what an object was in the sky.  I quickly looked and was in sure.  It did not look like any type of airplane I had ever seen. It was a &amp;quot;pill&amp;quot; shaped object much like a Tylenol tablet.  I would estimate it was at a high altitude much like a commercial airliner.  There was no noticeable wing span visually or when I zoomed in with my phone camera.   When I noticed the object it was slightly above the tree line of my viewable horizon.  I quickly took a picture of the object with my phone.  The object was moving in a straight line but very rapidly and was hard to follow with my camera.  I had only enough time to take a second picture before it was beyond my view on the opposite horizon. There was no sound or jet trail behind the object.   I have viewed many high altitude planes in my life but have never seem anything like this or moving that rapidly.   The pictures I took were with my IPhone 4s with an 8megapixel camera zoomed in as close as I could get.<n>

It became a lot less funny and more serious when all of us realized we were looking at a UFO. Before yesterday they were just a joke, ya know?  It disappeared after five or ten minutes. An unmarked plane came through within seconds of it disappearing, and it was even more obvious that what we&#39;d seen before was NOT a plane.  It was oval/almond shaped, very smooth around with no sharp edges or corners and fairly bright, it looked as though the sky around it had a halo effect and was slightly darker than the rest of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a picture I took on my iPhone where you can see the light from the craft, but not make out the craft itself because of the poor quality.<n>

It was a very clear night except for one cloud the stood in the middle.  I whitnessed a unidentified flying object which resembled a star. It was movong at a high velocity due north.  It was not a plane because it was too far away and moving at an incredible speed. It was a constant light. Resembled a star. The object that was headed due north got lost behind the cloud.  I watched and waited for it to reveal itself when i thought i saw it headed due east. It wasnt even traveling in a straight line.  It&#39;s course seemed curved.  Thats when i noticed a second unidentified flying object flying out of the same cloud and this object was headed also due east.  No other object came out of the cloud and both objects looked like moving stars in the sky traveli.g twice... maybe three times the speed of a commerical aircraft.  This event was observed may 28th 2012 above waynesburg pa.<n>

Saw what appeared to be a jet plane but appeared to be no exhaust or jet lines tailing it, was just moving through the sky reflecting the sun brightly.  Pointed it out to people in the car, they recognized there to be no exhaust or typical trail.  Seconds later, it completely disappeared from the sky.   Clear sky, broad daylight, no clouds--completely gone from the sky.  It&#39;s direction of travel would have put it directly in front of our sight.<n>

All of a sudden, we see a light moving at a high speed across the sky.  We tried to capture it on his camera but we couldn&#39;t see anything because of the darkness.  It was very dim and not blinking, so it couldn&#39;t have been a plane.  It was too fast moving to be a sattelite and to slow to be a shooting star. It moved from one side of the sky to the middle in about 10 seconds and then dimmed off. We thought it was a one time thing and would never see it again, we were surely wrong. About that time we saw another coming from a completely opposite direction.  After about 3 minutes we saw another.....then another, then another, then another.  They all did the exact same thing. We are 16 and 18 so we knew we wouldn&#39;t be believed so i called my father outside to see them, he saw 2 and went back inside dumbfounded, he couldn&#39;t believe it.  This went on about 14 times in al! l.  Some came very close to planes, but were much smaller than the plane lights.  At one point, there was one about a centimeter behind the other from our eyes.  After a while, we decided to go inside because it was late.<n>

Finally decide to go out in the middle of the country by myself, and noticed an orange orb in my rear view mirror.  I assumed it was a field light, but the orb never left my sight for over an hour of driving around.  I finally parked and sat on my trunk and watched it watch me.  After about an hour of it sitting there, it was starting to turn day light. Then it gets really bright so I decide to take a picture so someone else can see what I was seeing. I managed to get two pictures with my camera phone, not blurred, was not streaked so it was not a moving object, and next thing I know it was gone.  I just would like to hear a response to these pictures because I cannot think of anything but a u.f.o that would cause this image.  The sun was not over the horizon yet, and no car would cause such a orb light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was out walking up and down our quarter mile long driveway listening to music in order to hopefully get tired enough to sleep.  The time was around 3am (about an hour ago) and I looked up to see a bright light moving through the sky.  It was slightly bigger than the stars, so I assumed it was a plane, but it was extremely bright and I&#39;ve never seen a plane that bright before.  I stopped and kept my eyes on it thinking it was perhaps a shooting star, but it wasn&#39;t moving fast enough.  After about 10 seconds of watching it, the light started to dim slowly, until it was more dim than all of the stars.  The object, which was a round ball of white light, appeared to break formation, or separate into 2 separate red/orange balls of light which began moving in a circle. They circled each other 1 time, and then disappeared straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be lying if I said that I weren&#39;t slightly shaken by witnessing this.  There was no alcohol or drug use present, my mind is completely clear of every detail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to pass this along to someone in hopes that maybe someone else in my area has witnessed something, or if there&#39;s any information I could get back.<n>

Two witnesses spotted two orange lights to the south of my location. From my position they seemed to be just over the houses I think they may have been a half mile or more away one higher than the other.  At first they seemed to be either slowly moving toward my location or slowly climbing up. They seemed to float there for a short time Thought at first they could be balloons with flares attached.  The higher one would begin to go higher and the lower one would follow. they began to climb faster the highest one went straight up accelerating out of sight the lower one followed but continued to climb in a northerly direction leaving a faint vapor trail I did not lose sight of the second one until it was overhead and to the north seemed to be at a very high altitude by this time and moving at a very hi rate of speed did not hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/27/12 21:24|Portland|OR|Light|3 to 4 minutes|Bright, amber, shimmering light in sky above Southeast Portland|5/29/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/089/S89234.html|59|ndxe201205| Bright, amber, shimmering light in sky above Southeast Portland<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 9:24 PM from the residential east facing slope of Mt. Tabor in Portland, OR I witnessed a light in the sky located South/Southeast approximately between Mt. Tabor and Mt. Scott just below the scattered cloud layer that behaved like nothing I have ever witnessed in the sky before.  I was outside of the house preparing to move my car into the driveway from the street where it was parked.  As I was getting into my car I was now facing south, and before sitting down into the car I noticed a bright, amber, shimmering light in the sky comparable in size and intensity to a street light viewed at 1-2 blocks away.  What drew my attention is that the light was so bright and at this point it was stationary in the sky.  To be clear, there is frequent air traffic over Mt Tabor depending upon flight arrival patterns at Portland International Airport (PDX), so we are very accustomed to witnessing bright jet landing lights and how they appear/behave in the night sky.  Wh! at I was now observing was definitely not any form of conventional aircraft, and was definitely not jet landing or helicopter lights.  Approximately 3 seconds after I began observing the light it very smoothly and rapidly moved from south to north in a straight line toward me covering approximately an eighth of a mile in the sky, though the distances are hard to gauge with the clouds as my only reference point in the sky.  There was no jet noise or any other sound.  The light stopped and hovered stationary again, very bright and clearly visible.  At this point I called my family members that were still in our house via my cell phone from the street to come out and look at this light, because I did not want to lose sight of it.  The light continued to hover for approximately 1-2 minutes with clouds blowing by above the light while the light remained stationary.  By now I had one witness with me observing the light.  Now, the light moved again in the same manner to the east b! y another approximate eighth to one quarter of a mile where it! stopped again, and remained stationary in the sky.  A third witness had now arrived.  We observed the light for another 30 seconds to 1 minute as it hovered stationary in the sky with clouds blowing around it as it sat in a small patch of open sky.  The light must have gained altitude during it’s last movement, because at the end of this period the clouds began to then move in front of the light, became thicker causing the light to fade behind them.  From this point the cloud cover thickened in this area of the sky.  Three of us watched the sky for another 15 minutes but never saw the light again.  I don’t think air traffic control at PDX was routing planes over southeast Portland last night during this event because I did not see or hear any jets while observing this light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was looking at the beach I noticed two orange lights seem to lift off from the beach and head skywards.  At first I thought they were fireworks the way they shot into the sky but they kept going.  The two orange balls stayed next to each other as they ascended.  I then thought they were helicopters but they were too close to each other and too bright orange.  As they ascended to the top of the mountain one of the undulating orange lights dropped below one side of the mountain the other continued skywards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The lights were not the same as on a airplane getting ready to land.  I watched it for about four minutes until a text message came from my daughter. After I read her short text, I looked up and it was gone and nowhere to be seen. I live in the country where street lights, etc... so not ruin the view of the night sky.<n>

It seemed to be stationary at first and I could see it at intervals through tops of trees. While aproaching intersection of Route 4 it was directly overhead. We turned towards the south on Route 4 and stopped the car about a 100-125 yards from intersection in front of a cemetary. We got out of car and I told my brother who was driving to get his camera phone out.  I looked back towards the North to see it and it was gone.  Then my brother said look their is a second one. It looked identical, shaped like a lightbulb, and was towards the south-southeast over the cemetary. It seemed to float somewhat stationary above the cemetary for about a minute then slowly traveled in an eratic floating type manner directly above us and then towards the North.  We watched it for about 2 minutes. My brother who was driving wanted to leave before it was out of sight because he had a head light out on t! he car.  So, we drove to my house about 2 minutes away and got in my car to see if we could find it again.  We drove back to the sight and continued North on Route 4 for about 5 miles and did not see it anymore. It apeared to both of us like one of those Chinese Lanterns that others have seen as well.  So, was it a Chinese Lantern? Was there actually one or two of them, I&#39;m not sure.  There was no sound from the object.  My brother did capture it from his phone but it is not very clear and only lasts a few seconds.<n>

We stayed at a hotel right on the lake.  We checked into the hotel around 10:00pm.  The first thing we did when we got into the room is check out the view from the balcony.  My boyfriend saw it first, and pointed at this orange ball in the sky over the lake.  It was moving towards the other side of the lake.  I was freaking out and desperately trying to figure out how to take a video or picture on my phone, but couldn’t figure it out.  Then it just got smaller and disappeared into the distance.  This all happened in less than a minute.  A weird coincidence is that we went to dinner earlier and there was broken glass all over my seat and I cut my figure.  Now my left index figure has a triangle shaped scar right below my figure nail. It always reminds me of what we saw.<n>

It was moving quite fast, then slowed down. I realized that this was not an airplane, nor a helicopter.  The sky was clear, and there were no clouds in sight...it started blacking out, and coming back bright orange/red and kept blacking out. I felt an odd feeling come across my body and my eyes began watering for some reason.  I knew this had to be a ufo, and I ran inside to get my wife, and when I came back out it was gone.  Another strange part to this story, was that there was definitely enough time to run in quick, yell to my wife and I run back out to see it if it was a plane it would have still been visible.  I know this was not a helicopter as it was moving too fast, and was too high for a chopper.  And I know it was not a plane because planes simply don&#39;t look that way in the sky...a little freaked out at the moment, and mad that my wife didn&#39;t see it to believe it.  I know what I saw in the sky, and &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; are definitely watching us on this planet.<n>

I saw the lights, ran inside to get my friend, called him out to look at the lights.  We stood there, and saw three lights in the sky.  They made no noise and were going from Northwest to Southeast and were flying very low, just under the clouds.  The first three lights appeared to be waiting for something.  After a minute or so, another light came along, and then another. The first craft went up into the cloud and we never saw it again.  Then the next craft went up into the cloud, then the next one, and the next, flying in a loose line.  Just when we thought they were done, along came two more lights at the very end.  They, too, went up into the clouds. These lights were not blinking; they were orange, possibly each had one red light on it.  The night was clear enough to see stars, and these were larger and brighter than stars. There was a quarter moon to be seen on the other side of the house.  There are airports nearby, but I had seen a ! small airplane earlier in the day, and it was flying much higher than these lights. It also made noise.  These were silent.  These were not fireworks, or they would have lost their brightness, and fallen, and most make noise, but they are not allowed in Deep Creek.  I am a retired teacher and my friend retired from a nuclear power plant.<n>

On 05.26.2012, that a friend of mine who was with me looked up in the sky and asked what is that!! I, then looked into the sky, and saw a reddish orange ball, moving from the south to the north.  It was approximately the size of a dime at a 45 degree angle from my position facing east.  From the time I first saw it from the time it disappeared, heading north east, it was approximately 10 to 15 seconds.  I am positive; it was not an air craft, because there was zero blinking lights and no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would urge anyone else who witnessed this UFO sighting, to do a report on this sight or contact your local media.<n>

Lights passed over Mississippi River from Greenville, MS side to Lake Village, AR side of MS River.    Slow moving, low altitude, no sound, non-specific formation (however, four or so were in an equidistant straight line.)   Definitely not helicopters or airplanes.  Once each lighted orb reached a specific point in the sky, the light took off at &amp;quot;warp speed&amp;quot; straight up at a sharp right angle.    The object was so far away in a fraction of a second - it disappeared, or was no longer visible. This scenario repeated for each light once it reached that same spot in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my and my Husband&#39;s third time to see lighted objects in the sky that behaved in exactly the same manner.  Other two times occurred over Lake Pontchartrain near Slidell, Louisiana, and around Dauphin Island, Alabama.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Then it flew out of our sight over the mountain. We watched it for almost 10 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We witnessed many more flying objects on our walk at 3am. Some appeared to fly in shape patterns.

Then around 12am on May the 26th the sky seemed to clear up verry quickly and all the stars were verry visable; more than i usually see. when we wittnessed the UFOs there wasnt even a cloud in the sky.

The date is 5/25/12 and the time is 10:45 pm.  I was just lying on my car and watched what I believed at first to be a star start and continue to move in erratic patterns.  (north/ west/ east concentric circles etc) It is a overcast night, so I was really just trying to pick out stars through the clouds when I caught sight of it.  I spotted the object at around 9:40 or so, and watched the object for roughly 30 to 40 minutes.  Then I saw two dim glowing lights, which appeared to be on the underside of a belly of a broad shaped rounded triangular craft, (almost as if they were on the wing ends) in a trailing motion shoot across the sky to the north west and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked across the street to my neighbors house as my neighbor was sitting outside on his front steps facing towards the north and his wife just pulled up in her vehicle.  I asked them if they saw the lights, and neither one of them had been watching the sky at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went in to tell my wife as I was very excited to have witnessed what I did and she came out and we both proceeded to watch the sky for roughly 10 min before we saw what appeared to be a white shooting star from the south east pause, move very erratically, (almost as if a sparkler held by a child no trail though) then shoot off in an eastern slightly northern trajectory very quickly.  Then as my wife who was frightened by the sighting stayed by my side there I saw an additional light (red this time) moving towards the south pause and change directions much the way the first object did for just a couple of moments.  I then lost sight roughly at 10:25 or so.  It was very dim and my wife who wears corrective lenses could not make out the last sighting.<n>

We were just admiring the night sky and the lights reflections on the clouds (We just moved here from the midwest 1 month ago).  As we were cloud/star gazing, of course we noticed airplane after airplane because of our close proximity to SeaTac and the joint military base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden we see an object that resembles a star, but is moving!  It stopped abruptly and then moved again.  The object was above the clouds as it disappeared and reappeared.  It had a blueish/whitish glow to it, but nothing extraordinarily bright.  I have never seen anything like it in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have spent many years active duty in the military and I am a mental healthcare provider for the government, so for all purposes considered, I have been around a lot of aircraft in my time. My wife is a public school teacher.  This object had to have had some sort of piloting or external control, it could not of been a shooting star! because of the abrupt stop and go and acceleration.<n>

Hill Rd in Flint MI. I was facing a more or less Westerly direction and looked up.  Over my right shoulder, travelling from East to West was a flying object trailing a long tail of fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, I removed my cell phone and recorded video footage of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object proceeded in a Westerly direction until it vanished into a bank of clouds.  I kept recording, anticipating the object’s re-emergence from the cloud bank, but saw no further sign of the object.  It was much larger and more vivid in the sky than any aircraft I have previously encountered.  It burned very brightly and intensely, reminding me of nothing more than a launched rocket as it may appear shortly after lift-off, while still travelling through Earth’s atmosphere.  It was that appearance which caused me to make the reports and requests for information I made.  Being a Cold war Veteran, I could not help but equate what I saw with a possible missile launch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being concerned for the safety of persons, I called Bishop International Airport, MI Air National Guard, MUFON, as well as local news agencies who I asked if they had received reports of this event-all replied that they had NOT received similar reports from other persons. Several suggested that I report the sighting to police, which I did NOT do. Whether Terrestrial or Extra terrestrial, there was no crime which I observed being committed or anything which I would perceive as falling under “Police Jurisdiction”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Officer I spoke with from Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center spoke to his Base Commander, who had previously served at Wright Patterson AFB in Ohio, and the Commander stated that the USAF does not “officially recognize UFOs” and cannot, therefore, take reports concerning the sighting thereof.  He recommended I contact the National UFO Reporting Service and provided me with the number and website information to do so.  I am now doing so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to contact me if you have questions or information concerning this Atmospheric Event. I do have video footage which should be reviewed by an analyst.<n>

The 2 original objects faded until we could not see them anymore.  The 4th object remained constant for the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 30 minutes later a new object appeared in the southern sky, lower than the previous sightings. It was orange and circular. It faded from our view and reappeared in the same location 1minute later twice. After the second time 3 orange objects appeared in the form of a small triangle in the same location and the proceeded to fade out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The final sighting occurred at 11pm. One individual witness saw an orange circular object in the western sky moving north.  A second object appeared to be following the first.  The objects faded as they were moving and disappeared.<n>

I was walking back home from the convenience store just across the rural road.  Our not too long driveway is almost directly  aligned with the driveway of the convenience store.  In other words, a hop, skip and jump away from my door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was almost out of the parking lot to go and cross the road, I looked up and seen a silver white airplane that was about  the size of a commuter plane.  I wondered what it was doing flying so low in this area.  It seemed to be over the bush  between our road and the road behind our backyard.  This &amp;quot;plane&amp;quot; began changing form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Between these distinct forms, it was difficult to see any form distinctly changing except for when the &amp;quot;helicopter blades&amp;quot;  seemingly went back into the form before it finally became cigar shaped.  Instead of looking like playdough being reformed  by invisible hands, instead, it was only grayish or hazy with an indistinct moving form on the outline of the shape.  Between  indescribable shapes between the indistinct shapes, it did keep a white silver changing shape body of the same size as the  original &amp;quot;plane&amp;quot;.  The final cigar shape was about the length and fullness of the original &amp;quot;plane&amp;quot; body.  I only stopped looking  at it once, briefly, to make sure I could safely cross the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this shape changing took place in the length of time it takes for about fifty steps tops.  The thing remained a silvery  white color throughout the different shapes.  Despite hurrying up, I lost sight of it when it went behind the trees in the  backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The different shapes and order are as follows:  1.  Very low flying airplane shape.  It was so low that I thought it was unusual and kept watching it.  It was faintly  luminescent whitish silver in color.  The &amp;quot;plane&amp;quot; began to lose its details somehow yet kept its shape somehow.  I could not  seem to really get a grip on its form as it began to change enough for me to catch on that I could be seeing something unusual  that I should just watch instead of trying to make sense of it.  It was astonishing and my eyes kept trying to make sense of it  between shapes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.  Three pronged shape without the full body of the airplane shape.  It more resembled the thin body of the musical triangle  only the three lines formed a wide bird foot or pronged triangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.  A spinning bangle bracelet type shape attached by a few thin rods to a shape changing smaller thing at the bottom.  It was  sort of like a snow cone shaped frame attached at the point to an egg or some form that always kept changing shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.  At the top of the snow cone frame appeared a large oval light.  It was also silver light and while it seemed like a light, it  did not  illuminate the still very bright early evening that would soon become twillight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.  A clear helicopter form that at one point seemed upside down as the small shape at the bottom of the snow cone became  bigger.  It was a definite helicopter form with the whirly blades shape above it.  I do not know if the blade shapes were  actually whirling.    Rather, I was watching as the nose of the &amp;quot;helicopter&amp;quot; became more detailed in its shape.  In contrast, the  spinning bracelet from which the light appeared in number four appeared to be moving in a more obvious way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.  A cigar shape with a few small shapes with/or little projections on the body of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7.  These little shapes on cigar shape disappeared right before it went behind the trees.  It was then just a smooth white silver  cigar the last time I saw the UFO.<n>

One will start to rise over the mountain top into view and come up, and continue going up, along with the second brightest one about 15-20 minutes later (also there was only one in sky for the first 3 days). The second one is very odd because it&#39;s for one the brightest, and it appears to be just hovering over the hill top or just past it. They&#39;re both bright and circular in shape. They have also been appearing for about 4-5 weeks now. I&#39;ve never seen it before until I saw it rise one day, and where I&#39;m living, i&#39;ve been here for a couple months now and have never seen it before. (along with several other witness&#39; who agree.) I&#39;ve called the yakima training center and of course have gotten no response. It freaked me out so bad the day I saw it, I actually called the police lol.  They said a police office was enroute to check things out; but they never showed. I have a couple video&#39;s of it from the night I first saw it, and have sent them to the new&#39;s station for a possible explanation but no response either.  In total there has been 5 witness&#39;, and we all don&#39;t have any idea of what it could be.  They also never seem to go down, I know it might sound like stars (by god, I hope so) but it&#39;s so in your face.

Tonight at 11:15 I was in bed and looked out my west window and saw a flying objects with blinking lights. When I saw the blinking lights I immediately thought it was a plane, but right after I saw the first blinking lights, the craft revealed more of itself and I saw many blinking lights, far more than any plane should have.  At this point the craft does look like it could be circular/saucer type form.  After I saw this on the west side of my house I go to wake up my sister in her room on the east side and look out and we saw the craft much farther south north than I had anticipated when waiting for it to come back into my view.  The entire time the object moved relatively slowly compared to a plane but that depends on the height.  We saw the lights get farther away as it moved north-easterly and over some houses and trees.  The second time I saw the craft it was much more saucer looking; the lights were more in line now.  One large craft flying from west to northeast; large, with blinking lights of various colors (the notable ones being red and white) possibly a saucer style.<n>

I immediately concentrated my vision on it to see a simi-transparent appearing,cegar shaped object with a faint white, slow pulsing light on each end,traveling slow and low, I would estimate an altitude of about 250 ft.,making not a sound,I mean no engine, no wind disturbance, perfect silence.  It was traveling south-southeast,passed behind the north eave of my house,appeared again before going behind a tree on the other side of my house.  When I moved to the back of the house for a better vantage point it was so faint it faded out of sight.  I went inside and watched the tube till I thought about calling the sheriffs off. to find out if any one else possibly saw the same thing,that was about 24:00 hrs.  The officer said no and asked if I wanted to file a report, and inquired if there was any property damage,which I denied and thanked him for his time.I&#39;ve always wanted to witness a UFO and I think I have but it wasn&#39;t any bright, vibrant,darting kind of thing.I never saw anything comparable in my lifetime, it was a personal experiance for me.<n>

The green light was an orb, the center being bright green, and the outside being a hazy translucent green.  The center appeared to be blinking.  The object was around 50 yards from me, and appeared to be a little higher that the telephone pole/wires in my back yard.  It could not have been very high, as it disappeared behind the trees in my neighbors yard.  The object made no sound, and was moving close to (estimate) 60 mph.  I waited for quite a while to see if it would fly back around, thinking it was possibly some sort of RC Toy.  It never came back.  I was unable to photograph/video the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The brightness of this could be compared to a pure white that was luminous.  There was no trail behind it as it crossed the sky.  It was silent. It was moving at an accelerated rate of speed.  Very fast!  It did not cross the sky as though it was falling it crossed on a very horizontal level.  It appeared to be low in the sky like a high flying kite.  Lower than a plane. It was not flashing in anyway.  It was coming from the southeast heading northwest.  As I noticed it cross the street overhead it abruptly vanished.  It did not fade out into the distance it was as if someone shut it off like a light switch.  It was not any kind of search light or promotion light that had a beam attached to it. It was a sight I will not soon forget.  At the moment!  I saw it disappear<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son who was in the front seat seated next to me said. WHAT WAS THAT!

As I noticed the 2 flying globes, I pulled over immediately, got out of my car and observed this event in more detail. The flying red globes made a 90 degree turn from southeast heading to a northeast at approximately 25 to 30 miles per hour flight speed at a complete silence. They were probably as big as a large car and I noticed that their flight was at a controlled manner due to the fact that the second globe was following the first with the same distance all the time. I witnessed this event for approximately 30 to 45 seconds.  I snapped a picture of one of the flying globes with my phone’s camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I got back in my car and drove about 100 feet around the corner to get to my residence’s street when I noticed another red flying globe, but this time they were 3 red flying balls/globes with the same path as the other 2, heading northeast, approximately 100 to 150 feet above the ground at the same speed as the other earlier 2 red globes, same size at a complete silence like the other 2. I pulled over immediately, got out of my car and recorded a video of the event.  I then drove to my residence and pulled in my driveway. I proceeded to my house to tell my wife what I have witnessed and recorded,  then I proceeded back out front to get the groceries out of my car and I noticed another flying red globe, same size, flying slowly 100 to 150 feet above ground and  heading  the same northeast path  as the previous 5 red globes. I rushed into my house to tell my wife and we ran through my house to get to my backyard. We got outside and both of us witnessed this red flyi! ng globe at a very slow control flight over my backyard heading the same direction as the previous 5.<n>

The object has appeared in the area 3 times in total within 2months April and May. There are two witnesses me and my mother, she saw it first. Describing it as a small doughnut shaped object black looking in color. I told her if she is sure of what she saw it seemed very small, so I asked her maybe if it was high up, she said as high as the vultures, which I assume is far, we have many vultures flying around in the area.  About 2weeks later I saw it for myself, as I explained it to her I was like ok I think iam seeing it.  We both ran out to observe, it was slightly lower as she said it seemed bigger. It glided very slowly, I decided to tail it on the road and as I did this it sped up.  So did I, it eventually turned vertically on its side and began wheeling itself up into the sky until it vanished out of sight. After that it took about 1week to appear later again, each time it appea! red it came earlier at first it was maybe around four then around 2 the last time about 11:35.We remember this one the best, it came out from the sky, this was the first time we saw where it came from. In the direction where it appeared I believe what they call a rainbow cloud is where we saw it coming from. IT came very close to where we were, about 20 feet away where I was able to tell every detail. It was disc shaped and it was not black, just metallic. Up close it spun like a top while still moving and it reflected the colors from all around it, the sky, the car, the roof, everything. I screamed from outside at my dad to get his camera because I refused to move, it bolted straight up into the sky at an incredible speed. Since this last encounter it never returned or at least it doesn’t show itself.<n>

As I looked at the stars, there was a tiny white light moving like a satellite.  I enjoy watching satellites traverse across the night sky.....but, all of a sudden this tiny dot of light started making sharp angular turns.  It darted right, then left, upward, then downward with maneuvers no known craft can do.  I have never seen a UFO, but am an avid star gazer (for 40 years) and I am also an amatuer astronomer.  In other words, I know what planets, constellations, and other sky objects look like.  This strange little light was odd, and, frankly, it kind of frightened me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We notice no sound was coming from the object and it was stationary transparent alomst but reflected light from the street lights on the bottom.  rectangel in shape two red ligts on one end with a space in between and two green lights on the other end. it was trying to pose as a steet light or helicopter light skeem.  We went to drive around back to it for further detail but when we got back to the spot the craft had already vanished.

I noticed something moving in the night sky a crescent shaped object moving north, no lights, or sound. I did notice the dim lighting of the lights from the location below reflecting, illuminating the object.  The area is suburban, to give you an idea of the lighting I’m speaking of. My observation was 30 to 45 seconds, and then the object Turned West seemed to maneuver into a horizontal flight position, so I assume what the crescent object was doing was the banking maneuver. At this time I lost visual contact. I was not thinking of what to use as a guide to accurately measure the size of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do live close to an airport, where daily military F15s have runs.  I can say that what I saw was flying lower than the usual fly by of the jets I see during the day and what I saw was definitely bigger by 10 to 15 feet. Did I see a drone? The location of the airport is in St. Louis, MO. Lambert International airport /Boeing.

Watched it and noticed its movement was not a straight projected path and it was almost dancing.  I began to flash my lighter in the air in hopes to make some sort of communication.  It would stop while I was lighting my lighter and as soon as I quit, it would make a real quick movement as if it were saying hello back. 30 mins goes by of watching and I see another one moving across the sky in the general area.  I watch for another 15 mins, then my buddy came over who was on his break from work and he noticed another one.  We shortly realized that their were roughly 25-50 ufos in the sky, with more creeping up on the horizon and they were all moving.  Then I noticed that every formation was some form of a triangle. Around 4 I see one ufo zoom out of the sky as if it dissappeared, it looked like a shooting star, but I watching it from start to finish. Around 430 I noticed the same! ufo i was attempting to make contact with was directly on top of me because it was the brightest one, thats how i noticed it in the first place. I ran around my pool several times and each time it would move where I would be.  Around 505 it was beginning to get daylight out but there were still a couple formations still visable, one being the first one I witnessed. I noticed that it was not just one bright light, but also had two dimmer lights that made a triangle shape, that I only noticed when there was more daylight.  I began to flash my lighter while waving, and did for a good 20 mins.  Every time I flashed and stopped, it would make its move back letting me know they see me.  But this time I got to see the full triangular craft in midflight.  The only way I can discribe its movement is just like the old video game astroid, the bright light was always pointing to the direction it was moving forward, but could also easily slide backwards. Around 515 am this one craft was! the only one remaining in the now blue sky.  I began waving m! y arms i n the air as if I was telling it to come closer, and it centered up right on top of me and began to slightly decline in altitude. It was visable enough for me to see the whole shape, sheer size, and its stealth, it made no sound. A little before 530 am, it began to climb back up into the sky and vanished. I thought I was star gazing to relax, but slowly figured out they werent stars<n>

I thought it was a spot light fr a helicopter looking for a fugitive in my yard. But I heard no noise or felt any wind. so I turn to my rt, where the light was coming from &amp; up in the air, next to my neighbor&#39;s front yard tree was this bright bluish-white light, coming downward on me, from a BIG round shape object, that at first glance looked like the moon. it did not move, just stood still. I then took 3 steps toward it. Then as I was looking at it, it just disappeared in a blink of an eye. So I went inside &amp; went to the front yard &amp; my neighbor&#39;s, but saw nothing. Ran inside &amp; started to pray!!!<n>

The light went off at some points and than on while it continued to move around the area of my house (within 3-4 miles as i was trying to watch it, the light was not always on).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason i know for a fact this was no ordinary flying object to our knowledge of aircraft is for a few reasons. 1) the object circled and zig zaged over the hill in the back of our home at a speed that would be impossible for any pilot to handle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  The object at one point was directly above my home about 600-700 yards (hard to say how high, but not high enough for an airplane in our area, but high enough not to hit any trees or anything by far.)   When it was overhead there were no blinking lights indicating it being an aircraft of ours... the only lights were a mix of yellow/orange (again i cant explain the color, almost as if nothing ive seen..).  Needless to say when it was that close to my home over the biggest tree in our yard, i ran back to the house to make sure i wasnt going to be the next person with an abduction story or something like that to be the town crazy....  Anyhow if anyone else saw this light/lights in the sky please report it on the web.  I could not have been the only one who saw this.  It was fast moving, and did not always have the lights on as if it were moving sometimes without lights..?  but there was something out there that is a fact.  Please post if you saw anything, i would like to reassu! re myself that this did occur and was not just some strange weather incident or anything over that nature...  THANKS&amp;gt;<n>

Suddenly, an ISS-like object (in terms of magnitude and size) appeared and started to move in a straight line, fairly quickly, across the sky from the NE to E direction, at about a 20 to 25 degree altitude.  At first, I yelled &amp;quot;It&#39;s the space station!&amp;quot;   What was strange was that it was accompanied by a light above it, slightly dimmer, about half or more of a full moon apart.  It moved at the same speed, in roughly the same direction.  Both lights blinked out about 5 seconds after appearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked the satellites in our area using this site:  http://spaceweather.com/flybys/  and I don&#39;t see anything that matches that time, our area, and the area of the sky it appeared in.<n>

A second bright light light showed up 10 minutes later, but located more directly overhead and was constantly bright(not flashing). The second light appeared to be moving slightly in circular motions. About 10 minutes after the second light appeared, the first light that resembled a small start suddenly flew across the sky and the two lights began to move around eachother very noticeably.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two lights were far too distant to be any type of aircraft.  They resembled stars. They also changed directly rapidly and moved in circular motions.  I have not seen air planes or other flying objects move like this.

We both saw a diamond like shape craft (assuming the shape because of the placement of the lights, it was too dark to see anything other than the lights)  The craft flew from south to north, it did seem to move pretty fast and it was once it flew over some trees that we saw how close it was, it was much closer than an airplane would be at its highest and if an airplane were landing it would still be closer possibly. it looked more like it was gliding, not like most flying aircraft, not even gliding but sliding like it was being pulled along a track, it changed speeds because once we noticed it go over the trees we saw the lights afterwards for another 30 to 40 seconds and it was getting lower.  We’re very sure it wasn’t a plane, it moved to weird to be a plane.   Also, I’ve seen something relatively similar to wh! at I saw tonight out that window before and going in the same directing and making almost the same course, each time the lights have seemed the same a diamond-like trapezoid; three lights in a line with the middle set more to the back, and one more above the middle light.

I was gazing at the stars out of the passenger window when I began to see flashes of light and a cluster slowly begin to form.  Some lights were flashing bright like a camera flash, while others were dim. I would have to guess that dozens of these lights had flashed randomly during this time.  There were 2 separate incidents in the cluster of flashing lights, they looked like a bright orange ball that appeared like an explosion that stayed a round shape and disappeared.	One appeared to have been closer than the other and/or much larger and these two lights were a few seconds apart.  The light show seemed to be contained in an area that seemed to be within a 100 miles wide, my apologies if this not specific enough. I convinced my husband to pull over and he saw the the light show as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes we began driving again, I kept watching the light show only now the lights were flashing faster and looking brighter.  Not more than fifteen minutes later, I begged my husband to pull over again because I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes.  As we stood on the passenger side of our vehicle, we noticed the lights getting brighter and flashing faster.  After a couple of minutes we realized that the lights were moving towards our direction. We saw white lights that were in sets of two, one light above and one below. As they got closer we saw the lights flew in a very tight and incomplete capital letter &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; formation, meaning some areas of the &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; were missing. There were a few lights flying outside the formation as well. The lights flew over us with the top of the &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; flying directly over us at an angle from right to left. They made no noise that I could hear and were rectangular in shape. They were small, about the size of small plane. The ! lights had an LED appearance to them meaning the light was distinct but not very bright. They flew so close together that it appeared that some of the lights in front looked like four lights hooked together. From the time we were able to make out that the lights were flying towards us till they flew away from us and out of sight took about four minutes. In my best estimate the objects were as close as within about one hundred to two feet feet when directly over us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a fire in Safford, AZ at this time and am not sure if this is a coincidence but our eyes were burning the next day and we stayed in bed all day.<n>

On May 22, 2012 at about 1pm, my neighbor and I were playing a round of Frisbee golf at the Chico course off highway 32, about 4 miles east of Chico and it is part of Bidwell Upper Park.  I had brought my camera along, Cannon 3.5 mega pixel in the Auto mode.  I wanted to take some vista shots and some shots of my side-arm delivery that is very spastic, lol.  On the 6th (I posted the wrong hole # on my report to CTC website) hole my neighbor took a sequence of 3 pictures (the 3 pictures took less than 3 seconds to take) of me doing my drive from the tee box….. the first one shows my bad form and the white disc already going the wrong direction,lol.  The second one shows me finished with the drive and the disc has already landed.  The third picture is of me staring out in the direction of my errant shot and surveying the trouble I had gotten myself into, lol.   We ran into a young rattlesnake on the next hole, it went on its way and we went on our way.  Other than that, an! uneventful round of Frisbee golf, lol,lol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, on Thursday, the 24th I downloaded the pictures and went through them to delete the ones I didn’t want to save.  When I got to these 3 pictures I was blown away by the third one for sure.   In the first one, you only see my white disc and the clouds in the background, the second one shows me finished with follow through and the disc just landed, only the clouds in the sky.  The third one, it looks like I’m staring right at the UFO.  But I did not see it, nor did my neighbor who took the shots and we didn&#39;t here anything.  But the digital camera did catch it.  When I magnified it with my Cannon Utilities program it showed a lot of detail of the craft.  I submitted it to CTC on the 25th, they posted it on the 26th in the photo of the day section.  I’ve had 3 e-mails from people saying it was a Tiger Yellowtail Butterfly….. my simple magnification shows a craft, not a yellowtail butterfly.   How come the first 2 didn’t have the butterfly in the picture field? I’m hoping that you will be able to further enhance it and give me your feedback.  It appears to be ¼ to ½ mile away and about 500-1000 feet high, I’m guessing.  So Peter, here are the 3 pictures of the sequence, I have not sent these to anyone else….don’t need to scare people with my ugly mug,lol.  I await your feedback, thank you ahead of time.  And Keep Up your good work.  I hope you took a moment to reflect on my fallen comrades and those before us on this hollowed day.  And I pray to God we remain the Beacon of Freedom.  Take Care and Stay Healthy.<n>

It was bright enough to light up a large portion of the sky in distinct bands behind its path, not a trail but bands that fanned out, it even lite up the ocean; very clear night, some clouds on the horizon, light winds, 2 to 4 foot seas with a new moon, sky was very dark.  The light could have been between 20 to 40 miles away.  It was moving very slowly away from us, to the left and downward with no change in direction or intensity and was visible for approximately 10 minutes.  If I were to plot its course my guess would be it was moving in a north northwesterly direction.  It disappeare! d behind a cloud off our port bow on the horizon still showing bands of light behind its path and after a minute or so the light went out with no sound.  The owner took a photo with his iPhone and given the light conditions and the fact that we were at sea the photo is poor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were sitting there looking at it for about 3 minutes with no movement, they were just there.  The orb on the right, bottom corner started pulsing in and out of light (well that&#39;s what it seemed like) out of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the top orb disappeared out of nowhere, leaving the two on the bottom alone.  The orbs started pulsing one at a time and the one on the right  seemed to zip off in an unfamiliar way. ive never seen nothing like it.  I tried to follow it with my eyes but in a blink it was gone.  Then the last one standing just disappeared.  I wish I could have recorded it. It gave me a strange feeling, one that I&#39;ve never felt in my life. In a way it was cool.

We were driving on a two lane road that leads back into the east side of our city.  As we turned right at a corner that leads back into the main road, we drove another 100 feet until : on the right side of the road I saw a 8-9 foot figure that was walking back into the edge of the forest located under a street light.  I immediately hit the brakes, unsure of what I saw, my cousin who was in the passenger seat looked as shocked as I was. I yelled “I think that was an alien”  The car came to a stop and my cousin yelled “Go Go Go !”  I sped up and my eyes were tearing up as I couldn’t believe what I had just seen, my cousin said “I thought I was seeing things!” I replied with “No I saw it too!” we drove to our appt which is near by still shocked and startled I immediately called some friends they came and picked me up and drove us  back to the spot where I saw the figure I explained what ha! ppened to them, and when we drove back to the location some brush had looked to be parted where something had walked through it. I made the call to the hotline next where a gentleman told me to make this report and call local authorities which are being called now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The figure stood 8-9 feet tall , had a tall rounded crown shape head, the head was as big as a human abdomen, the figure was somewhat muscular looking, it had big eyes, but not stereotypical alien-like , long legs and it did not seemed started whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the source of this report, and he sounded quite sober-minded and objective to us.

It is a fairly dense residential area. Suddenly, through the trees to the north, my attention was drawn to a very bright red light. It outshown every other light in view. Since it was low, no more than a hundred yards off the ground, I was confused by what I was seeing. At first, I thought it was a light on top of some radio tower, but there isn&#39;t any such tower in the area. Then, I could see it was slowly moving in my direction. I thought it was too low to be an aircraft, and I have never seen such a bright red light on an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed my car, and watched intently as the light passed over the trees and into the clear sky above me. It passed slowly over the two-lane road on which I was driving, no more than two or three hundred feet in front of and above me. I would estimate it&#39;s speed as no more than ten to fifteen miles per hour. What had first appeared as a solid red light wasn&#39;t solid at all.  It was a spherical object, made up of a geometric assembly of very bright red lights, each apparently identical and equally bright. The lights didn&#39;t blink on and off, and did not vary in intensity.  I would estimate the size of the sphere as no more than ten or fifteen feet in diameter, about the size of a small car, and as it moved, it was quite clear that the lights were evenly spaced, geometrically all around the sphere.  I counted five lights on one hemisphere. It looked like some kind of huge lighted Christmas ornament. And it was beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was amazed and completely awe-struck by what I was watching. I pulled the car to the side of the road, stopped and rolled down the window, which provided a clear and distinct view of the sphere, which was by now no more than 200 feet away. I was able to estimate its height and distance by comparing it to trees alongside the road. It was completely silent, seemingly floating in the air. It continued it&#39;s southward course, and as it passed by, the rear of the object came into view. I was struck by how evenly spaced the lights were all around the outside of the sphere. The red lights had an intense, radiant quality. They were very bright, and I could make out each individual light. It was like a ball of evenly-spaced red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My view to the south was completely clear, unobstructed by trees or buildings. I watched the sphere as it continued slowly south for perhaps a half-mile, clearly silhouetted against the dark night sky.  The red lights remained on.  Then, it accelerated abruptly, and moved up so quickly that it disappeared in the darkness.  There was nothing left to see but the stars.  The entire episode lasted about two minutes, perhaps less. I looked at the clock in my car when I first realized what I was seeing, and again after the object disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t drinking, or under the influence of any substance.  I have never seen anything like it.  I am convinced that it wasn&#39;t any kind of aircraft; not an airplane, or a helicopter, or any kind of balloon.  There was no wind, and absolutely no sound whatsoever.<n>

I also noticed another object flying parallel to it but at a pretty good distance apart which turned out to be a Grey colored jet.  The object was 4-5 times larger than the Jet as the Jet went almost directly over us and it&#39;s altitude was quite high.  As it went past it was Bright Silver due to the sun reflecting off of it.  Not long after that one got out of another Cigar shaped Object appeared heading in the same flight path as the first only there was no jet following this one.  All in all we were able to see a total of 8 of these Objects flying in the same direction but not all were in the exact same flight path as the first 2.  One of the Objects emitted some sort of a trail almost like a chem trail of a Jet but it didn&#39;t last long.<n>

At approximately 10:05 am  today, May 21, 2012.  I looked up and saw a round white orb floating/hovering in the sky over Mt.Rubidoux...just a little to the right of a small dead tree on the side of the mountain. To be honest, I was just planning to look at the mountain as I have a thing for mountains. I looked at the orb like floating object for a moment and finally told my friend to look up as the object appeared to just be hovering.  After about 20 seconds, I decided to pull out my Kodak Play Sport Camera...that I always carry with me as I love to take pictures of my surroundings.  I started filming; however, I did not have my glasses on and could not see anything through my view finder, thus I only took a 19 second video clip from this vantage point.  The friend I was with suggested, I take still photos rather than video (which can be heard on the video) and then look at them when I get home to se! e what the object is by zooming in on the object if I actually got it in the picture frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought...maybe it is a star...but I love looking into the sky at daytime and night time, yet I have never seen a star in this location at this time during the day. Due to the brightness, maybe it could be a meteor...but this had no tail, nor did it appear to be moving. Then the idea of a plane was in my mind...but again...this object was hovering...it was not flying in any direction when I first started my observation.  Eventually, I thought it could be a balloon...but again...the object just hovered....it did not move up or down nor did it move side to side...it was stationary for at least 10 minutes before it began to very slowly move in a northward direction. I then thought...maybe it is a weather balloon...but again...it did not move and it appeared to be too low for this type of activity. Additionally, the object was too high to be a hot air balloon. The object itself over the 40 minute time frame appeared to be round but could change from triangle, square o! r diamond shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now over the next 40 minutes, my friend and I walked from Mt. Rubidoux …to the Carlson Bark Park and across the bridge to a fast food place (Baker&#39;s) on Mission Blvd.  After exiting Baker’s we walked up to Limonite.  During that walk, I took 12 still pictures from different locations and 2 separate videos...one being 19 seconds long and the other being 39 seconds long.  I personally would have watched this object even longer and taken more photos and videos if my friend was not wanting so much to get home before the heat became unbearable...after all, we were on a 6 mile walk.  Yet in the time we did look at this object, it did eventually move northward very slowly...in fact, we went into Baker&#39;s and when exiting about 10 minutes later, we could still see the orb nearing the mountains near Ontario or Fontana.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, during our viewing, I saw at least 2 airliner (jets) fly by...so commercial jets did have an opportunity to witness this object as well.  As far as making any noise...neither of us heard anything.  Eventually, I lost sight of the orb once I got to Limonite and the sun was in my eyes...making it too difficult to see at this point.  However, I do have to say, when I got home and looked at my photos something interesting appears. Remember, at the time, I saw only one object...and that is also noted in the first 19 second video; however, in my first still picture...there is a second object off to the right and when zoomed in you can see a very solid object and yet when I took my second still picture...the second object is gone. We are talking literally seconds from picture to picture and I did not see or hear anything at the time. Yet for this object to be missing in the video and then in the first picture but not in the second picture it had to be traveling so fast that we j! ust could not have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is it. So yes, I do have pictures and videos from different locations and I used trees, telephone poles, light poles and the mountain as reference points...so it can be verified by qualified researchers. I also did not erase them from my camera, so if real scientist would like to observe it and get the data and meta data from the original pictures and video they have that to reference as well.  I would send in the pictures and videos but I only want them studied and verified by qualified professionals at this time until I can get proper copyrights on the video and photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness A – 45 yr old, Male,  Former US Army Intelligence Analyst who served with the 75th Ranger Rgt, 10th Mtn.

I was able to get a quick picture of it as I was driving.  After observing the picture later in the day I noticed something in the top corner of the shot.  It looked like an oval shape that didn’t seem to be any type of familiar object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After zooming in to get a better look, it occurred that the object looked similar to a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing the picture a few times I was unable to come to any other conclusion.  I believe I captured the image of a UFO passing over RT 3 in Clifton, NJ.  I returned to the site several hours later to see if the object was still there but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were way too wide to be an airplane or helicopter, too many lights as well. Also there was no movement to these lights they were perfectly still.  I noticed this right before getting to the 2 freeway, after debating in my head “what could this be?”  I decided I was going to pull over when I could find a safe spot (the 2 is super dark at this time) and try to take a picture, as soon as I was thinking that, the lights flickered and then they were gone. I think people who talk about this stuff and would even take the time to report it are crazy, but I feel whatever I saw was definitely unique and based on my knowledge of what’s out there a! s far as any type of aircraft goes the lights I saw don’t fit any description of any kind of plane, helicopter, blimp, and so on…..<n>

The sky had some scattered clouds on an off through out the night. Just before day break I was looking south about 70 degrees off the horizon I noticed what I thought to be Venus at about 4:19 am, but i realized that Venus had went down earlier in the evening ,about 10:00 pm, just when I tried to adjust my telescope it started moving north, and dropping in altitude.  It moved without sound it appeared to be a cylinder of light standing vertically.  It moved north slowly as it got closer about 45 seconds.  I live by a small county airport my house is under the landing pattern.  This LIGHT was flying the wrong direction within the landing pattern.  It then changed direction and headed east at a much greater speed. I watched it til it was gone with binoculars.<n>

I was laying in bed for some time completely awake when I looked out my window when a light appeared on a cloudy night.   At first I thought it was just the moon shining, but the object was moving.  I could see the white light object through the trees and it was descending downwards slowly.  I kept my eyes on it for about 30 seconds and then it went below the tree line.  I could not tell if this object was very far away or right beyond the trees, and when it went below the treeline and I could no longer see it, I did not hear any crashing sounds or any sound at all and it never reappeared.<n>

We live in a very dark, remote area of town and it&#39;s very easy to see the stars in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was fumbling through my purse for my house keys, my husband was behind me looking back at the sky. I had just seen a shooting star when we were exiting our vehicle, so he was trying to spot one too.  Suddenly, he said &amp;quot;look at that!&amp;quot; When I turned around I saw a white light that was flying across the sky over a distant mountain. It definitely was flying at a slower speed than a shooting star but it looked like something similar.  I had enough time to turn around and witness it along with my husband.  All of a sudden, the light grew much, much brighter and in my opinion appeared to &amp;quot;blast off&amp;quot; from the original speed it was flying. In my husband&#39;s opinion after the object lit up it looked to him like it flew down or landed somewhere but it happened very, very quickly.  It was beautiful and truely amazing.<n>

I was thinking about if it was a star or a planet or what, and as I continued on the highway, it got bigger and bigger, making me think that the object was stationary in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then got even closer and realized it was an aircraft of some sort. Nothing I had seen before.  It was circular, bright yellow-orange, and had white lights on the bottom ascending and descending, so it could have been L-R or R-L depending on your perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got even closer, I kept thinking, that is not an airplane or a helicopter, I have no idea what that is, then it hit me, it must be a UFO!  I was so mesmerized and trying not to crash as I was driving, that I didn’t get a photo.  I drove right underneath it though and then passed it, confirming that it was stationary.  I talked to a friend, and! before I could say anything describing it, she said she also saw a UFO last week, same location, and described it in a similar fashion!<n>

There were no other people in the park that I could collaborate my sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 22:35 I was facing to the northwest and sighted 6 large orange lights moving slowly towards me from the northwest. They were traveling in what seemed to be formation in two by two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not distinguish their shape, size or altitude except to say they first appeared to be lights 5 to 6 times the size that satellites shine in the sky.  The two closest to me looked like they changed their forward motion to moving straight up in altitude.  I analyzed their motion to be this because the lights got smaller and smaller until they were the size of a small star.  Their color also changed to a white and sometimes bluish white and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed that the other lights were changing motion the same as the first had but not in the same sequence. At this point the elapsed time must have been 4 or 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was trying to watch the complete disappearance of the first 6 sightings another 7 lights appeared from the northwest traveling in the same direction and in what seemed to be takeoff formation. These 7 followed the same path of travel as the first 6.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were then 5 more lights that appeared and disappeared the same way. The total elapsed time for all these sighting was approximately 15 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a licensed pilot with a commercial, multiengine and instrument rating and can state without any doubt that these lights were not fixed wing or rotorcraft flights.<n>

The temp was about 65F and humidity was 26% so very little cloud and clear dark skies. As we live in a rural area and the Lake, Erie, is in our south about a mile away the sky is very dark. At first I thought of a helicopter,  No way because it was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;orb&#34; type object was silent and moving very fast towards the WNW.  Bye the time I retrieved my camera and ran to the back door to shoot a photo the object was past my overhead.  After the photo was taken, approx. 8sec, the object dimmed and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved in a straight line in an arc angle of 180 degrees, in other words straight across the sky at a fairly low altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about the size of 1/8th of the full moon high in the sky.  It was singular object, no trail or other lights were observed.  Spooky to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 55 year old male who always looks up to watch the sky and this is the first time I am able to say, I am amazed at what I saw and no reasonable explanation can do.<n>

My family and friends had actually been at the sweet spot watching the eclipse and we were returning home for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were about to go into the house when I saw a bright orange light in the sky toward the side of our house, so I walked over to investigate.   When I got to the side yard I saw that there were many of these orange orbs, all appeared solid and they were flying low to the ground, barely above the trees, however they didn&#39;t make a sound!  They were moving from south to north. I like to think they were flying from the sweet spot too. :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly started calling my family and friends over to witness this, and my friends started taking pictures and video.  he orbs were in groups of three and four, no pattern, and they faded and disappeared right above my house.  We could see others coming from the south as the ones nearest us were fading and disappearing.  We saw at least twelve orbs, and I was able to take pictures with my cell phone.  Usually my cell phone doesn&#39;t take very good pictures, but I was pretty impressed with the pictures it took that night! I wish my phone could&#39;ve taken video.  Part of why I&#39;ve waited so many days to report this sighting was so that I could include my friends videos and pictures, but they live out of state and left the next day, so I&#39;ve decided not to wait for their pics and vids, and just report this sighting with my pics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was incredible to see these objects, and now I can&#39;t stop looking at that part of the sky hoping to see more. The lights appeared to be orbs when seen with the naked eye, but in the pictures I&#39;ve included they seem to be different shapes. In the picture with three objects, you can see one fading and the two that were right behind it are brighter but they also faded and disappeared when they got to the same spot in the sky.<n>

That was until I noticed them begin to move. They didn&#39;t move in a linear way like an airplane or jet would, and they didn&#39;t flash or shimmer like a helicopter or any other aircraft would. I begin to see them gradually separate from each other, some in slower speeds than others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were 5 of us that all caught this sighting.

The temperature was comfortable - probably at least 20 degrees Celsius.  No wind. The West sky had a red-orange glow to it.  The 5 of is witnessed what we feel was a UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two brilliant red round objects emerged from the North, flew towards us in unison, and then changed direction to the west.  I first thought the sun was reflecting off the wings of an airplane, but did not see an airplane shape nor did I hear any airplane sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started a process of elimination &amp; felt strongly it was not an airplane, a helicopter, a comet, or a balloon.  The five of us were trying to figure what this was, but only figured out what it was not.  My wife wanted her glasses so she could get a clearer view so I RAN back inside the house, couldn&#39;t find her glasses and came out with a digital camera instead.  I started filming at 8:36 pm, but at that time there was a small penny sized white circle getting fainter - just like someone started to dim its light, and it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two minutes later the 2 bright red lights appeared again in same place that I saw the 1st set of two - in the North.  I was thinking that what I saw did an elliptical type track - from the north, headed south, turned towards the west, and then circled around to its original position.  I also thought that as an alternative this 2nd set may be a completely new set of lights (and not the 1st). I started filming it at 8:38pm.  The 2 objects appeared to take the same path as the 1st set of objects.  I only saw bright red as the dominant colour.  Did not really notice the green until a replay of the video, and the white only when it started to fade in the west.  I wasn&#39;t sure if the objects were fading because they were getting further away or the lights were dimming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the sighting we carried on walking, looking around and hoping to see more of what we saw.  There were two other people in our neighbourhood who I asked if they saw that stuff in the sky.  The acknowledged that they did &amp; we spoke about ufo stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total, 6 adults &amp; an 11 year old witnessed this event.<n>

They appeared to be flying well under what a jet airliner would be cruising at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second light was trailing the the first one by a little distance, perhaps a mile or two at the most.

It took approximately 60 seconds for it to move across the break in the clouds, and disappear into the clouds out my sight.  The craft was somewhat golden/yellowish in color, but the color was flat and not metallic, and I did not notice any lights on it.  It had all kinds of venting/pipes of some sort on the back end with longer ones towards the outer edges.  It was huge-maybe 3-4 times the size of my home.  It must have been only 600-700 feet above ground, and seemed to be barely clearing the homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I screamed at my neighbors who were outside gardening to look up at the sky.  They turned to look where I was pointing to, and shook their heads as if they saw it, but they didn’t seem to get very excited about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later I asked around town if anyone else had seen the craft, but no one had and there were no reports of it on the news.  It&#39;s very frustrating for me that no one seems to believe me.<n>

Knowing that the first thing to do when witnessing a UFO is to get another person to see it, I asked my wife to verify the craft had no wings, which she agreed could not be seen in the time we were &#39;allowed&#39; to view it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was traveling N-NE over Oakland, Calif., at an approximate angle of 50 degrees and climbing, the same trajectory as numerous planes we notice taking off from the Oakland airport daily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made this sighting unique:  While still attempting to verify the lack of wings 100%, the object passed behind a building as we were driving, and we waited for it to come out on the other side to continue viewing, but it NEVER RE-APPEARED.  I scanned the entire sky when clear of the building obstruction, the object was nowhere to be seen in the sky, which is an impossibility given the physics and elevation of the flightpath.<n>

They had appeared in that location and would reappear in different spots around that vicinity for about thirty seconds.  All of the streaking motion was in the vertical axis travelling downward and left shimmering white tails behind them.  There seemed to be an initial moment of rapid activity from when they appeared and were performing some type of quantum like relocation behaviour to different spots and then making the downward streaking motions releasing light or energy.  At this point it was too rapid to pinpoint them as craft or energy and we could not make a count of them. After this initial period was over, there were two craft that could be seen as steady objects moving side by side across the valley and over the mountain.  They primarily gave off a sequenced white flashing light as they moved along. It was bright white just like the streaking, but much more softer and not shimmery.  A small red light could be seen on the objects at the low points of the flashing.  They moved slowly at a moderate altitude and gave off no sound at all as it was very silent out also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After they disappeared over the mountain ridge to the south, we were discussing how incredible it was too see such an object and it&#39;s initial performance, and a third one appeared in the same spot in the quantum bouncing and vertical downward streaking motions and immediately travelled at a lower altitude than the first two with a path directly overtop of us and our fire with the same flashing light and a moderate flying speed.  Due to the lower altitude of this craft and it being directly above us, I was able to see a blueish green soft hued glow in a disc shape as it was directly above us.  This craft passed over and continued in a straight line towards the mountain ridge where the first two had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 to 15 minutes after those craft left our area, on the opposing ridge of the mountain they had disappeared behind, I saw a green streaking meteorite enter the atmosphere along the ridge and then crash on the other side of the ridge.  I was tempted to ride over to see what it was but it was still not sunrise yet, and didn&#39;t know the trails in the area well enough alone. We stayed by the fire for a bit after the meteor to see if there was any other activity.  There was a point of some noise from birds awakening in the morning, and one moment where I thought I heard some strange noises coming from across the river in that direction, but they seemed more cerebral than aural.  There was a brief moment after that when we both felt watched and were too nervous to leave the fire even for a tent twenty feet away.  Things seemed to calm themselves from there and we both retired before the full sunrise started.<n>

We were sitting on the porch, and chatting.  1 of my friends was sitting on the steps of the porch and looking down (Possibly texting, I do not remember.)  And my other friend was a foot behind me and standing to my left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well we were at a trailer park, and around this trailer park it is heavily wooded. When you step out on the porch there is a tree line.  So, we were all talking outside on the porch laughing, and I had this funny feeling, like I was being watched.  I turned my head, and I saw it.  It was a cigar shape, with two VERY dim red lights on each end of the craft. It hovered there for 1 second, then it came up higher from the tree line into full view about 250-300 feet away from us and about 50-70 feet high.  Then it rose up higher, and made a 180 degree turn (Slowly) and shot up and out of sight, when it did this, it revealed its pointed front end (Triangle) so it came out of the woods, completely flat and appeared to be cigar shaped.  When it reality it was a triangle shape, the event lasted roughly 6-7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this I was dumbfounded, and before the words could leave my mouth my friend that was behind me said, “Yea, I just saw it to. Oh my God.”  The friend on the steps didn’t see or hear a thing, and to this day thinks we were just yanking on his chain.  The lights we saw were so dim, that in all honesty you had to be looking for them in order to see them.  I still have no clue how we saw them.  A month or two later I got the nerve to look behind those woods.  And there was a woodless grassy area where I assume the craft took off from.  It was fantastic and scary, but I haven’t stopped looking up in the night sky ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Note)- I called your hotline the day after this occured and I never found a report on it, on this website.<n>

Then the first light flashed again but this time it flashed more towards the east then again the second flash of white light behind the first light.  Then a very very dimItseemed likedim flash of light between the other two but a little bit closer to the 1st flashing light.  It was as if this was one big craft moving very slowly towards the south east.  There was no sound no other lights nothing else.   As soon as i stood up to really examin this in the sky, it simply stopped.

What I saw is something I will NEVER forget or be able to explain. There, in the clouds, was a bluish light going around in a large slightly irregular circular pattern.  The “light” was rather large and in the clouds not a ground light shining up.  The night was completely overcast, but the clouds where it was were very slowly spiraling also.  Much, much slower than the light itself. It was covering a large area, I would estimate from the ground about a mile and a half radius. There was no noise whatsoever. I got my wife to come and see and we went outside to watch it. We watched for about 45 minutes. She began to get a little “freaked out” so we went in. I continued to keep checking on it for a little bit. It was gone after about 20-30 minutes.  I did not see it stop or exit. We had not been asleep prior to this and I am a smoker who smokes outside in the bac! kyard. This was not a spotlight, as it had not been there 20 minutes prior to my first sighting of it.  I say this because I had gone out to smoke about that length of time prior.  I have looked for it to return EVERY night since. We cannot explain this and have really tried, as I don’t consider myself a “believer.” But this was definitely unidentified and it was flying. As for the object, I think “it” was obscured in the clouds. If this can be explained or have seen similar I would like to know for our piece of mind. I can be contacted if you wish.<n>

EST, I witnessed two orange glowing &amp;quot;globes&amp;quot; in the night sky. They were maintaining a steady speed and steady distance apart.  They moved up and down above the tree line and across the sky from east to west.  There was no distinct sound emanating from the objects.  There appeared to be a bluish center within the globes. I took a picture with my camera phone.  The picture shows white lights all around the globes, but I did not see any white lights. The two orange globes were like eyes in the sky with no face. There was nothing surrounding them, no light or sound emanating from them.  I watched them for about 3 minutes until they slowly disappeared behind a tree line in the direction of a closed nuclear testing facility within our area.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in the night sky.<n>

I noticed a flashing red light in the sky and figured it was a plane, since there are always planes from O’Hare in the area.  When I looked closer I saw that it had no other lights, it was simply a flashing red light which I don’t remember ever seeing on any plane before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I told my friend to look and he saw it too, it was quite obvious.  We watched as it flew in a wide arc towards us.  As I said I see plenty of planes all the time.  It seemed to be at a pretty high altitude, not at a really high cruising altitude but definitely not low like a landing plane would be. It seemed to be moving pretty fast too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it was facing us, we could make out that there were 2 blinking red lights side by side, clearly one singular object.  Eventually it went directly overhead and we could see that there were 2 much dimmer lights in roughly the same places as the red ones.  These lights were blue or green, one was slightly brighter than the other.  From far away you couldn’t see these lights at all. I couldn’t make out any kind of shape of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was travelling overheard we started to hear a jet engine, but it was pretty quiet and seemed to be emanating from far behind the aircraft, I assume because it was travelling at a high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It went on traveling west to east, in the direction of Lake Michigan until it was out of sight.  My friend and I waited outside for 5 or 10 minutes when I noticed the same flashing red lights again, at the same altitude, but this time they were traveling in the opposite direction.  It seemed to make the same wide arc as before but in reverse, eventually flying out of sight to the south or southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Currently there is the nato meeting going on downtown and the last few days I’ve heard plenty of military helicopters around this area and these lights just make it much weirder.  I can’t say for sure that these lights are related but it doesn’t seem like a coincidence, especially considering that whatever I saw was apparently staying over the area.  I did find it weird that the aircraft would turn around like that instead of simply circling around though.<n>

The light faded and I could a black structure still traveling at same altitude heading into the storm.  After the first object disappeared I soon saw a second light coming from NE to SW.  The object followed in the same path and appeared to mimick the first object.  This happened twice again to make it four objects.  These were traveling against wind heading into storm.  They were all maintaining same altitude above cloud line.  Estimated 1500-2000 ft.  Very intense experience.  I&#39;ve lived near air traffic my whole life and this was no plane. Made no noise!

Last night at 10:15 a series of very bright orange lights moved very quickly from east to west about 35 degrees above the horizon.  They did not blink, they all moved at about the same very fast speed.  There were a total of four and I could see three at one time, two pretty close to each other from my vantage point.  There was no noise whatsoever.  They came from the east and when approx in front of me either faded or moved south - either would appear the same to me.  The tree line blocked them from time to time.  I did take a video but all you can see are orange dots (when I optically zoomed the dots became disks though blurry and I could not hold the camera steady especially at that setting)<n>

I went out to my porch for a better look and was shocked to see a line of 7 or 8 red lights (about the size and brightness of Venus- only red) going from the West quadrant of the sky to the North quadrant of the sky. It was taking each of them about 20 or 30 seconds to go from due West to due North.   Once they got to due North the red lights would just hover in one place, which confirmed that they weren&#39;t airplanes.  Naturally, I assumed they were helicopters, but I couldn&#39;t hear anything and they just kept coming and coming from some point in the western sky  to this area in the Northern sky where they would sit stationary in a cluster.  After about 10-20 seconds of not moving, each red light would just go out, but then more would come to take their place. The cluster of stationary red lights never got bigger than 5 or 6 lights ! hovering together at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the 15 minutes this whole thing was going on I probably watched 25-30 red lights make this silent migration. It was most bizarre thing I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky. Yet there was nothing about it that required supernatural powers.  It could have been done helicopters.   But it sure didn&#39;t _seem_ like it was done by helicopters, and anyways, who would bother to do such a thing?  One thing&#39;s for sure:  it was definitely a spectacle and other people in downtown Rockport must have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Estimated altitude less than 5000 ft.  Craft shape is uncertain.  These lighted objects were in nearly a single file line, possibly a mile or more apart.  At an estimted distance of three miles, each object made what seemed to be a 90 degree course change, and fly northward toward Michigan.  The turn was fairly quick, as though a helicopters rather than a fixed wing prop plane.  Speed was steady for all, and though altitude is really uncertain, they seemed to be subsonic, moving no faster than a small airplane.  Curiously, upon turning, the front light seemed to disappear, but there was no taillight that could be seen on the side, if there was a side.  It was almost totally dark, so absent the light, the craft disappeared almost immediately.  Each one advanced in line, turned, then disappeared, over a total of 3 minutes.  We heard ! no sound of engines of any kind.<n>

At first it caught my eyes because the circular light was shifting its lights around, something like turning on another light source on the bottom of the object and then off, just for a second or so, and then remain a steady single light[fire orange] that was a perfect circle, moving north from woonsocket,RI. to blackstone,MA. very slowly and seemed to slowdown just a bit, here and there,,,it was a steady stright line path without any noise going from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

An orange, what can only be described as “fireball”, caught my attention.  I alerted the other 4 adults on the deck to what I was witnessing and they saw it clearly as well.  I’ve witnessed the ISS and Iridium flares many times and this fireball was neither.  What caught my attention as well was the trajectory it was taking, moving from the Southeast to Northwest, which is odd for most satellite movements I’ve witnessed over the years.  It moved at a much slower speed than the ISS would, giving me the impression that if this was a satellite it was at a very high altitude.  The fireball seemed to have a darker center than its surrounding orange haze and about 2 to 3 times the brightness of Venus over the past few months.  Over the course of about 20 seconds the fireball slowly faded to a single point of light, no brighter than a typical satellite seen traversing the! skies, and then finally disappeared toward the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, 90 minutes later a second fireball appeared directly overhead and once again I alerted the event to the other 4 people on the deck.  This fireball was much brighter and you could definitely tell the center was darker with this one.  It had the same Southeast to Northwest trajectory.  Again, over the course of about 30 seconds it started to fade out.  But, unlike the first one, it did not fade out to a point of light but instead what appeared to be a black solid object with mass.  My girlfriend was very intrigued by this fact as was I.  I assumed both of these objects were space debris burning up in the atmosphere during a re-entry event.  It had even crossed my mind that perhaps I was seeing the same object given the 90 minute time-span, about the time an object such as the ISS would take to make a complete orbit.  But again, thinking about it the objects appeared to be moving too slow for that to be plausible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Normally I would have just dismissed these sightings as possibly the most intense Iridium flares I have witnessed, burning debris or some sort of satellites I have not seen before. But, after discovering this web site and posting a report of something I saw back in the early 80’s I started reading about the number of fireball sightings since 2010 and thought perhaps my report would be relevant.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked toward Paris Mountain and noticed some orange lights in the sky.  At first sight I thought they were the lighted radio towers on the mountain, but then I realized that they were too high in the sky.  I looked more closely and noticed that there were actually two rows of these lights flying in a V-pattern (with the bottom of the &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; pointed toward Paris Mountain).  The lights that were further away appeared to be less bright.  I kept driving and the trees blocked my view, so I drove very quickly to the median on Pelham in front of Bruster&#39;s (I wanted to stop driving so I could watch them).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I noticed the lights that were closest to me were swooping, diving, rising, and chasing after each other (just like they do in amateur video footage).  Then these lights basically faded away. They just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove to the Bruster&#39;s parking lot, but by the time I got there, they were completely gone.<n>

Just above tree-top level and approx 1/2 mile away, I saw a very bright deep orange pulsating light that appeared to be a 3 tiered row of lights surrounding a verticle object. This object in the sky was about 1/2 mile away from my property but appeared to be as large as 1/2 or full football field. The object sat motionless briefly, and no sound at all. As I realized the enormity of what I was looking at, I started yelling to my family to come outside and tell me what was in the sky. As 2 other family members arrived on the deck, a second object was seen approaching from the north, very low on the horizon, could be seen between trees. It traveled in a straight line from about 4 miles away in 4 seconds. The first object shot upward to the right at about a 45 degree angle to completely disappear in 2.5 seconds. As the second object reached the exact same location as the first, anothe! r could be seen approaching from the left. Two other family members joined us at that time. The second object shot upward also at the speed of light to be gone in 2.5 seconds. This continued for 6 more times exactly the same each. As we stood in silence looking and listening, each of us were astonished at what we had witnessed and began talking about the light show. Approximately 3 minutes went by and a family member said &#34;look... here comes another one.&#34; #9 object followed exact path and slowed over us while pulsating (much like a heart beat)then followed all the other objects in the sky at a 45 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was completely clear, warm, quiet. Not even my 5 dogs barked. No airplanes or helicopters were seen before or after for about 20 minutes. Only the usual night time airplanes were in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

May 18 and 19 2012<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my pasture and noticed, right before dark, a very bright light in the sky to the NW of me.  It  was vertical with a bright light on each end, and the brightest being at the top.  It seemed to be moiving towards me very slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed the &#34;star&#34; and realized they were not stars but more UFO&#39;s that looked the same but further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a friend who lives NE of me and he went out and could see it too.

On my way in I saw what I thought was a shooting star right above me, it was close enough that I almost screamed.  The difference was that this light was dim and disappeared instead of fading out.  I wanted to watch until the o! ther ones left so I could see how they left.  The person I was talking to had went inside also, he called me back about an hour later said it was gone.  I also saw it last night but just thought it was a bright star and just glanced at it before going in.  I also took a pic with my phone but it&#39;s not very good.<n>

I had gone outside to let a pet out. We live in a heavily wooded area that is separated from other houses and not close to any city lights. Our property is on an elevated part of the land and our deck is elevated.  I looked up, just above the pines and only a couple hundred feet in front of me, I saw a very bright red/orange pulsating light that was obviously not the norm.  As I was backing back toward our back door, never letting the light go out of my sight, I was yelling to my family “come here quick and tell me what the hell I’m seeing”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Four other family members ran out beside me, and everyone stood totally quiet... and watching. The pulsating light changed from a deep red/orange to light orange in color with each pulse. It pulsed at a very regular rate (like a heart beat). When it was the deep red/orange color, the shape was a three-tiered hour glass shape and as the light would change to bright orange it would illuminate the whole object to appear like a bright orb. No sound could be heard, no emissions came from it.  It sat totally still in the sky (as if it was allowing us to observe it… or was it observing us?). I tried several times to get a picture from my cell phone, but it wouldn’t process it. Then we could see three other lighted objects approaching from the southeast about 4 miles away. The first object then shot up at a 45 degree angle to completely disappear in a clear night sky in 2-3 seconds. Our view of the first object was never obscured as it left. The second object stopped at the exact! same spot as the first, paused briefly, and then shot off at light speed like the first one. This continued for a total of eight pulsating globes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We each stood there talking so quickly to each other because we were so astonished at what we had just experienced. Each one was giving their account of what they saw just to validate it. About 5 minutes passed when a family member said “look, here comes another one”. Indeed...another approached from the exact same direction. We could see it through the trees at about 4 miles away. It took about 3 seconds to get to where we were. It paused in front of us right where the others did, moved up slightly (as if it were making a correction) then took off at a 45 degree angle and disappeared as the other did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted our local airport and spoke to the director of air traffic control for Gwinnett County. He stated that they did not get any unusual reports that night. When I shared what we all saw, he said that he could not think of anything in our airspace that would fit that description. Two days later, we had unmarked military helicopters that circled so low you could read the name badges of the pilots (if the windows weren&#39;t blacked out). This activity continued at different times of the day with as many as three helicopters at at time, for about a week. I was able to catch a couple on video as they stayed below the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived many years near Hartsfield Airport and now Gwinnett County Airport. I have attended many air shows, flown in personal and commercial planes, been around military aircraft, hot air balloons, weather balloons, and an assortment of other flying or floating manmade crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pulsating objects were about ½ to ¾ the size of a football field, could sit perfectly still in the air without making any sound, had no emissions that could be seen, traveled from 4 miles in 3 seconds to light speed, and did not have any conventional shape that I have ever seen. I can say without hesitation or doubt that the objects we watched that night for about 20 minutes were not from our world. Where they came from or why they were here may never be known, but I do feel that this is just the beginning of these types of sightings. I have seen unusual things around our area for four years now, but this is the first time that I have had witnesses to back my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is strange to me how people don&#39;t want to believe or even hear about this. I come from a scientific background and would love to know what these are and how to deal with future visitations. This has nothing to do with faith or religion. You may keep both, but should realize that on our tiny planet we have such diverse forms of life with many not yet discovered. Surely you could see that in the vastness of our universe, life also exists...no matter if we haven&#39;t discovered it. However, I am certain that they HAVE discovered us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please help watch our skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Each object was about the diameter of a local McDonald&#39;s moving slowly above the top of the pine trees no more than 15-25 mph.  The crafts appeared to be moving in a synchronized pattern. Each disc had at least 100-200 round light bulbs going around the outside of the disc in a complete circle. Each circle bulb pulsating in a domino like effect.  1 bulb sent energy to the next over and over going from red, to yellow to green to blue and so on in a clockwise motion while there was a smaller ring of lights under the bottom of each craft doing the exact same thing but in an opposite counter-clockwise motion while being the source for all the energy feeding the outside bulbs down a series of 7 or 8 lines like the swirls in a mint candy or bicycle spokes.  Both at the same time.  It was so close It looked like Las Vegas in the sky but strangely did not leak a drop of light nor a shadow to anything under it.  They did not make a sound and one was like a duplicate of the other as far as movement and light synchronization. So to make a short story...2 big  saucer disc with light bulbs around the outside moving colors from 1 bulb to the next.  They had a smaller ring under the bottom that did the same thing counterclockwise. the smaller circle of lights feeding the out side circle of bulbs though a couple of mint candy type swirl of round bulbs repeatedly<n>

We both wear glasses and were wearing them at the time of the siting.  We were sitting outside, talking about a new video game that we recently started playing, and disscussing my commissions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not too long after, we decided to go inside and get back to work, but not before I looked up at the sky.  I noticed a little blinking light in the stars.  It wasn&#39;t moving, and it didn&#39;t seem like a plane to me.  I pointed to the little blinking red light in the sky and said &amp;quot;I think that&#39;s either a satellite or a UFO&amp;quot; in a joking manner.  My fiance asked me to point out the light to him and said &amp;quot;No, that&#39;s just a plane.  You can tell because the light&#39;s blinking red.&amp;quot;  I shook my head disapprovingly at him, as I saw the little light begin to move upward, &amp;quot;Planes don&#39;t fly up.&amp;quot; I said to him.  I was a little bit afraid (and still am) so I wanted to go back inside.  He asked me to stay as he was really interested in it, and we sat outside watching this little light move around.  Once we accepted the possiblity of it being a UFO I waved at it and said &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; in a rather silly way.  It moved in circles, rotating around and around.  It w! ould go up, and then back down.  It seemed to me like it was trying to keep it&#39;s balance, because it seemed wobbly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a round cloud around the flashing light (if I was a more educated in the fields of physics, I&#39;d go as far to say that it looked like it might have been breaking the speed of light or sound.)  The cloud moved around with the object, and seemed to be leaving a trail behind it as it moved.  The stars next to it (it was a little to the left of the big dipper) seemed to be reflecting off of it, but that might just be my own eyes, me just being in shock.  At about 2:35 AM I looked down at my watch as my fiance reached for his phone which he ended up not having anyway.  As we sat for another five minutes, we observed that it was moving very fast.  At this point it looked like it might have been moving away from us, but I&#39;m not entirely sure.  We were out there until about 2:40 AM when I finally convinced him to come back inside with me.  A few minutes later I decided to go outside for a few seconds and see if I could still see it, and sure enough it was still there.  Shor! tly after that I decided to come inside and write this down to see if anyone else may have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We saw a light blue light ahead of us and higher that the mountain tops.  There are several large mountain top removal coal operations in the area.  I could see what looked like reflections on metal but no real detail. After about 20 or 30 seconds ( hard for me to judge) the blue light grew in intensity. It looked like the light from arc welding.  It seemed to accend and move away toward the north/northwest slowly.  The area we lost sight of it has no mining.  I have worked on Helicopters and around aircraft in the military.  It was nothing known to me.<n>

I would sleep in a chaise lounger, unafraid, in the hopes of seeing a &#39;falling star&#39; (meteor showers) or the Northern Lights.  While I am convinced we are not alone, in all my 60 years I have never had an encounter of the minutest kind~!  On the 18TH of May this year I stepped outside in the evening air. Not expecting anything I removed my glasses for a spell to rest my eyes in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live between  two airports so I am well acquainted with the aircraft coming and going.  Pontiac Airport has smaller aircraft such Lear jets and private planes whilst  Detroit has larger passenger commercial planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also familiar with seeing satellites and the have seen the space station on occasion.  I watched mechanically as an incoming small aircraft approached above Pontiac Airport when a speck of light caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was so high my first thought was,  &#39;It&#39;s a satellite.&#39;   I put my glasses back on to have a better look and as I watched I realized it was moving faster and faster unlike any satellite I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a meteor; of that I am sure, having seen thousands of them my whole life.  There were no telltale flashing aircraft lights nor was there any sound.  It just moved swiftly straight across the entire visible sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize this is not enormously interesting in that it wasn&#39;t closer to Earth with more detail to report. But I was shaking and know it was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before, and I would be interested to find out by the mathematics of speed based on approximate altitude, distance and time; perhaps that would be an indication of whether it was of this world or extraterrestrial.  (Unfortunately, I&#39;m no mathematician.)<n>

Around 10:15 - 10:30 we saw a rather spectacular sight.  An object traveled across the entire sky from southeast to northwest at an elevation of about 30 degrees above the horizon as it passed in front of us.  We saw no maneuvering, but it might have turned slightly more north toward the end of our viewing.  It was orange in color and looked like a burning orange, but no flames.  It was not a spec but rather a sphere or disc, perhaps subtending an angle ¼ that of a full moon.  No changes in appearance, color or speed.  Its altitude appeared to be that of small private aircraft.  It could not have been as high as commercial jets because had it been, its speed would have been so great that we would have experienced a sonic boom.  It was moving moderately quickly, I estimate at 200 mph.  What was most interesting is that there was no sound! from it!  We both are adults, an engineer and a teacher.  We’ve seen many things in the night sky:  aircraft, spacecraft (ISS, Iridium Flares, etc).  Never anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We watched it until it disappeared, which only took seconds.  Might I say, I have never believed in other life than ours on earth, however, now I believe there are others &#39;out there&#39;.<n>

I have spent all evening in my backyard working on my company truck. I decided that it was all for today so I shut all of my outdoor lights. There was no neighbor outside and their exterior lights were also all shut.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to the far end of my backyard and sat down on a chair, alone, relaxing and looking at the sky. A few minutes before the sighting, I spotted the usual planes and one possible satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eyes were rapidly scanning the sky when something caught the corner of my eye. A &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; was traveling very fast across the sky, from west to east. As soon as I spotted the object, I tried to focus on it and follow it with my eyes :  I was completely mind blown. There was a total of three star-like objects moving fast in a linear formation!  They were surrounded by a very faint white disk-shaped halo.  What happened after that just blew my mind: the objects steered to form a triangular formation.  They regained their initial linear formation after about two seconds and I lost sight of the formation in the horizon.  They made no noise, no blinking lights or no strobes. It was just like that: stars travelling at enormous speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got chills immediately afterwards, I knew that what I just saw was not of this earth.<n>

We’ve spent many a night satellite watching over the years so it is second nature to peer upwards any chance we get.  She called me outside to see a different object in the sky. It had a definite disc shaped and appeared to be on fire. It was moving from the South to North approximately 90 degrees above horizon at highest point. Color was a very bright orange and it did appear to be on fire. It moved at a constant speed, no wavering, and at a pretty good rate. Sky was clear. Altitude undetermined, but if I had to guess I would say 3,000 to 5,000 feet if not higher. Size of object was about the size of a 737 at that altitude, but again object was disc shaped. I have an aviation background and I immediately looked for but did not see a contrail, no noise, no strobe or recognition lights. No glowing, or trailing debris, or smoke trail like you would ! see with a meteor or boloid. No sign of a balloon attached, like one of those party balloons that are sent aloft via a candle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was no candle and balloon. Object was way too bright, too big, and moving too fast for wind conditions, which were calm to light out of the South East. It appeared to be on fire because of it’s color and the way it looked around the edges, changing in shape ever so slightly like a flickering flame, but the brightness and intensity were constant throughout the object and never dimmed the entire time in view. Duration of sighting was approximately 7 to 10 seconds. Did not have horizon to horizon view of object due to trees and houses, only about 60 degrees of it’s travel was observable if object indeed went horizon to horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a similar object last summer and sent in a report at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our light turned green and we decided to make a slight right onto 518 and turn into the Sonic there.  We stopped and parked in the back they seemed so close and flying close to each other. We starred completly puzzled trying to figure out what they could be...I have never believed in UFO&#39;s or things like this, but I have been unable to find any answers as to what it was?  It seems like once they hit the same spot in the sky they started to disappear.  Even if there were clouds...as bright orange as these lights were I would assume we would have still been able to see a slight aura if they disappeared due to clouds, but we did not see anything it was as if they just vanished?!?!?<n>

I had sat down in my lawn chair facing North and while talking on phone I noticed out of the corner of my left eye, which would have been to the West, what appeared at first to be a bird that was gliding. The wind was blowing out of the North and it was like when a bird faces into the wind and is able to just hold its wings out and kind of stay in one spot while riding the current of the wind. After about 30 seconds of noticing the object I realized that this thing was moving slowly but with no movement (wings flapping).  I looked over at object and to my big surprise it was not a bird but only what I could describe as a solid black walnut shape. It seemed to be so close, but is hard to say how far away from me it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dropped the phone in amazement, not caring about the phone call no longer, knowing I wo! uld never witness this again. In fact, it was the weirdest feeling because my brain would not register what I was looking at. I watched this object fly into the Northeast direction, with absolutely no sound associated with the craft at all, until it dissappeared into the clouds. It stayed at the same speed the entire time of the observation, and since it moved across my vision from southwest to northeast, there were plenty of angles to tell that in did not have any wings.  I still to this day can not believe and will never forget this expereince, since it happened in broad daylight! I have seen plenty of odd acting lights in the sky over the years, knowing they were not of anything mankind has produced...at least publicly. From what I think the distance was from my position on the ground, the craft must have been around 25 to 50 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I removed my glasses briefly as I thought the “star” look blurry and thought maybe my glasses were dirty. In the next moment the object appeared to be much closer and changed from the size of a distant star to what seemed the size of a street light, still high in the sky but with a warmer more orange color.  Than it just turned to the south and began to move away climbing higher and higher until it was just a tiny dot and then was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was never able to tell the altitude, the speed must have been incredible, but I could not even guess how fast it was traveling.

After reaching the top, we heard a whooshing noise (described by my friend as sounding similar to the noise she heard incoming mortar rounds make when she was deployed to Iraq).  We looked up and saw a small black round object coming at us from the southwest.  It is hard to say how big it was because it happened so fast and we do not know how far away it was, but we think it was maybe 1-2 feet in diameter.  It was on a perfectly straight downward-angled trajectory and was moving MUCH faster than a bird could possibly fly. It passed over our heads, possibly within 30 yards or less, and continued down towards the road we drove in on.  We expected to see an explosion or puff of dust, but we never saw an impact.  It appeared to change direction and curve slightly upwards, and then we lost sight of it.  My first thought was that someone shot a missile or RPG at us; my second ! thought was that it could have been a meteorite.  But I would expect to see an impact from any of those things.  I think we were very lucky we weren&#39;t knocked off of the rock!  My friend and I are military officers (medical).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like a rusty dull orange light.  It moved in a straight line from the south west to the northeast at about fifteen thousand feet. It was no more than a mile from us.  It made no sound and moved slowly and wobbled a bit from side to side like a train on a track.  I said to my neighbor &amp;quot;what the heck is that&amp;quot; to which he replied &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot;.  Then another appeared from the horizon and followed the exact same flight path as the first.  At that point five other neighbors asked what the lights were.  We saw another orangish light follow the exact same path, and I mean without any deviation.  As the third light flew over a commercial airliner flew over the light and we heard the sound of its engines as it passed.  Then another light followed the others in the same flight path but moved vary fast as if to catch! up.  We are both attorneys and skeptics.  Whatever we saw were not conventional aircraft.

Then I saw a dim, blue light to the west about 45 degrees above the horizon. It looked and moved like a plane at first, but then it flared up in brightness, then faded out and disappeared. Then just behind where this light first appeared, a similar light appeared and did the same thing. It began looking and moving like a plane just as the first light did, flared up in brightness, then faded out and disappeared.  Then behind where that one appeared, another. identical light appeared and did the same thing as the previous two. After this, there were two more lights which did the exact same things as the previous lights, each time appearing slightly behind where each subsequent light appeared. I thought they may have been satellites, though it was unlikely, given the fact that there were so many of them.  But I checked the simple satellite tracker anyw! ay, and saw that there were none scheduled to pass overhead at that time.  The lights made no noises like you would expect a plane to. So I&#39;m really at a loss as to what these lights might have been.<n>

So i stopped ato look at it for a second and noticed it was smaller than the moon and there were 2 objects. My second thought was mayb they were fireworks but they never exploded and stayed stationary. I ran downstairs went outside and stood and watched them for a min or so. They started to drift off so I came back inside, went back into my bedroom and seen them again outside my window, even closer this time and by this time there were 3.  Then I ran back downstairs and watched them again.  The second time i went outside there were 4 and 3 were stationary and 1 moved in toward another (across) and back out again.  The lights were red and were not connected to an object. They did not move up or down. just closer and farther away and at points some stayed stationary while others moved in and out.  I have not seen anything like it befor and as close as they seemed! at one point if it was a aircraft ...helocopter or something it would have made a sound. We have a medical center helocopter and I know that it looks like at night in the sky. This was not any kind of aircraft that i had ever seen.  They looked separate too. I didn&#39;t get any sleep all night. I slept on my couch with all the lights on and kept waking up, no rest at all. Honestly, Im afraid to look out my window now at night. I don&#39;t want to see it again.<n>

Then it kept following the other yellow one until they were both out of my vision through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, though 15 minutes must&#39;ve passed since I first saw them and I literally had to turn around 360 degrees on the track to keep sight of the path.

I observed an orange object what appeared to be possibly flowing in the wind.  It made no noise but my friends thought it might be a chinese lantern.  I dont believe it was a lantern the winds would have blown out the candle.  The trees blocked my view within a few seconds so I had a limited amount of time to study the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Basically I was driving north from O&#39;neil towards Spencer on HWY 281 in Nebraska and I was watching the sky because there was a storm in the distance to the northwest of me and clear skies north and east of me.  When suddenly I noticed lights north of me just to the east side of the hwy.  The lights were clearly above the horizon in the sky.  It seemed like they might have been moving independently then they came together in a horizontal row of 4 lights and were evenly spaced aprart.  The cluster appeared to be hovering.  Then they began to move, but the cluster as a whole stayed in the same place.  The light on the right side of the row of 4 lights stayed stationary the entire time and the other 3 began to scroll toward the stationary light.  It was like the lights were on something round and it was rotating right so the lights were still evenly spaced and moving toward the stationary light.  When a light came close! to the stationary light it would dissapear and a new light would appear on the left side of the 4 lights.  It scrolled like this 5-10 seconds or so.  Then the outside 2 lights stayed stationary.  So between the 2 stationary lights from the left to right a light would scroll toward the one stationary light on the right side and it would dissapear when it reached the light and a new one would come out from the stationary one on the left move over the the stationary light on the right again.  It did this 5-10 seconds or so and I went to grab my camera and just before I turned it on they all just went out and I never saw them again.  It was strange.  I&#39;ve never seen anything I couldn&#39;t explain before so this was a first.  I am curious if anyone else reported anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly there was a sort of bright silver explosion in the sky above where I was looking, so I didn’t get the greatest look at it as soon as it happened, just a glimpse.  There was no sound just the flash of the explosion and for about 25 seconds there was a bright silver line hanging in the sky and it slowly faded away. For a second I thought it looked like a telephone line with moonlight reflecting off of it. That’s the best I can describe it I guess. I thought it was a UFO because; A: I have never seen anything like that before. B: it COULD have been a comet but I have seen a comet go by before and it looked nothing like that. And C: because it reminded me of in a sci-fi movie when a UFO goes warp speed or something and disappears leaving a silver trail that fades away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My window and blinds were open, and it was completely silent.  This was not lightning. I would compare the flashes to the shutter of a flash on a camera, except several times.  After three or so flashes, the sky was pitch black again. Whatever it was that was flashing traveled south (?) and flashed again several times, still blue and silent before stopping and traveled outside of the field of vision that my window provides.  I was texting my friend at that time, and noticed that my phone had frozen and restarted itself because I received a text right as it happened.  When I went to read it, the phone froze and would not restart/work until after the flashing lights were gone.<n>

Disappeared after 30 secs<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in a small village in Normandy, France, about 80 miles west of Paris. I am familiar with night sky, and often enjoy watching satellites go over, particularly the ISS. I subscribe to the “Heavens above” web site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of May 16 2012, around 22:50, I was on my patio when I looked up at the sky (almost clear of clouds), hoping to see a satellite or two. It was late dusk, and I could see the Great Bear and Polaris, but the majority of stars were not yet visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some 10°-12° south-east of the Great Bear, probably in Bootes (but I couldn’t yet see its stars), I saw a very bright yellow-orange object moving slowly SE-NW (at about the “speed” of a satellite). Its magnitude (brightness and dimension) was comparable to Venus (which was just above the W horizon at that time), i.e. about -4.5. Like Venus, it did not twinkle, but its edges were hazy. I didn’t hear any engine or propulsion noise (but a commercial jet aircraft went over about 15 minutes later heading SW-NE, and the noise of its engines was very faint).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was the ISS (but its colour and brightness seemed unusual), and after watching it for about a minute I went inside to collect my binoculars, which took no more than 30 seconds, but when I was back on the patio the object had completely disappeared.  I waited a couple of minutes, thinking that it was behind cloud (but I couldn’t see any cloud), then I swept the region with my binoculars, without seeing anything other than the low-magnitude stars not yet visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A visit to &amp;quot;Heavens-above.com&amp;quot; revealed that the ISS was not due to pass over my region at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apart from ball lightning, I was unable to find a “natural” explanation, so I reported it (by email) to the French GEIPAN site. They were very responsive, but concluded that I had seen a satellite (IGS1B) which is out of control, and subject to surges of brightness and is becoming difficult to predict.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In view of the colour and brightness of the object I saw, this does not convince me. I’m not aware of any satellite that is that bright (even the ISS doesn’t usually exceed a magnitude of -2), and its sudden disappearance is difficult to explain, even for an erratic satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After some thought I am posting the report here for your comments.<n>

A white light the size of a star moving at a high rate of speed!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 51yrs. old. I was facing south and the the object I saw was a white round light. It looked like a small star only it moved across the sky in a straight and seemed like a deliberate direction from the west in a ESE direction at a very high rate of speed. I have seen passenger aircraft and military jets at high altitude like the size of a star, day and night time with the blinking light or lights and they appear to crawl across the sky, when in fact they are also flying at high rates of speed. This object around 10:00PM-05/16/2012 did not blink it was a solid round white light and moved so fast. This is the second time in my life I have ever seen anyting move this fast in the sky. It looked and moved just like what I saw in the in the very early 70&#39;s when I was around the age of 11yrs old. Facing north, that object at first sight looked like a helicopter spotlight low in the sky then in a blink was the size of a tiny star moving from west to the ESE direc! tion at a very high rate of speed. At school the next day I told a friend Wallace what I saw I gave no detail because he responded &#34;Hey I saw the same&#34; before I could finish. I honestly did not believe him until that evening after school in the front yard of my house he pointed to the sky exactly where I saw the object, he moved his arm in a fast motion while pointing, like he was following the object in the same exact direction!  This on the night of 05/16/2012 was not an airplane, it was not my imagination nor was it a helicopter spotlight,shooting star ETC! I may be a skeptic to some degree but, I know what I saw was not normal!! I was in the navy starting in 1979 at Cecil Field Naval Airbase in Cecil Field FL. I never saw anything move as fast as what I saw on the night of may 16th 2012 and on that night in the 70&#39;s. My wife and I now live in the same house I grew up in. &#34;To sum this up&#34; On that night in the very early 70&#39;s I was facing the north I saw what looked like ! a helicopter spotlight and in a blink it was a white light the! size of a smaller star round in shape moving from west to a ESE direction at a very high rate of speed!! Present day on the night of 05/16/2012 around 10:00PM I was facing South and saw a white light in the West part of the sky the size of a small star, moving in a ESE direction at a very high rate of speed and was moving in a deliberate direction, not falling. It did not change direction and was visible to me only for about 15 seconds in the area visible to me because of trees.If this had been a normal aircraft like a military jet or even a passenger plane it would have taken at the very least a minute to pass the same exact distance.I take our trash out every night and look to the sky because I love the night sky and checking out the moon. I see aircraft all the time and know there is a major difference in what I see every night and what I saw the night of 05/16/2012 around 10:00PM and that night in the 70&#39;s.  Both events I saw in the sky ( 70&#39;s and present day) I saw from the sa! me house. I know of no aircraft that can move that fast when looking from the ground up to an altitude as high as these objects were! I know there are very fast jets...BUT NOT WHAT I SAW!!<n>

It was getting dark, but still somewhat light out.  My daughter saw it first, just to the left (south of the planet venus.  She said &amp;quot;is that a blimp?&amp;quot; I said &amp;quot;where?&amp;quot; and looked up to see a totally dark almost round but slightly oval object traveling in what appeared to be a northwest to southeasterly direction.  It appeared small, but the outline was very easily seen against the twilight sky.  My estimation, although I don&#39;t know the altitude, was that it seemed to be fairly low (below 5000 feet) and moving at a fast clip, in a straight line, making no unusual movements that would rule out an aircraft.  However it could be easily seen that there were NO wings, and I saw absolutely no running lights and no sound was heard.  My daughter, who was able to see it longer than I, said that she saw a small white light appear on the bottom right side of the object for about one second. I didn&#39;t see this. I lost sight of the object as it passed over and was no longer visible by means of the twilight behind it.<n>

To the east I saw lights in the sky, which I initially thought was an airplane. As my car got closer to a department of transportation building in the area I noticed a strange light formation from a small object appearing to be about 60-70 above ground level.  This is only a guess as it was still fairly dark but this is the feeling I got looking at it.  As I slowly drove by I noticed red and green lights.  They were not pulsating or flashing. The green lights appeared in a row and the red light or lights were on the other side of the green, but were not in a row.  They were either a circular cluster or just one large, round light.  I couldn&#39;t see the body of the craft but it moved in diagonal and irregular patterns very slowly and without sound. It also rotated slowly as it traveled.  I wish I had stopped and took more time to look at it but it seemed to happen so fast I couldn&#39;t process what I was seeing and thought maybe someone from the transportation department was using some kind of radio controlled flying vehicle.  When I arrived at work I spoke about it with other coworkers who live in the area and 4 or 5 others confirmed what I saw and they were just as perplexed as I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This just happened this morning and I&#39;m hoping to talk to more people around town this week to see if anybody else experienced this or knows of an explanation as to what this was. If I obtain any new information or insight regarding this I will post a follow up statement.<n>

Around 11:00 pm, three of us (my husband, my best friend, and I) decided to walk to the beach and look at the stars.  This is something I enjoy doing when I come to the beach.  When we got there, we all sat down on our beach towels to look at the sky.  It was a clear night with occasional small, thin clouds rolling through.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About fifteen minutes after getting there, I was turned to the southeast, facing my friend and chatting.  My husband was on the other side of me.  I suddenly saw a bright orange orb-shaped object appear in the sky above us.  It did not fall from the sky or come from the ground or ocean.  It simply appeared.  We all sat up and watched it.  Seconds later, two other identical objects appeared next to the original one, and they hovered there for a moment before disappearing.  This happened five or six times.  The orbs appeared to be moving in a formation, with the two secondary orbs following the lead of the first.  After about fifteen minutes of this, we did not see any more of the orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, we noticed that a smaller, whiter light that had been stationary over the horizon, out on the sea, was starting to move.  It moved horizontally southward, and also up.  It moved erratically, quickly, and occasionally moved northward and back and forth.  A second light of the same size appeared a few minutes later.  We watched these lights for close to an hour.  The second light appeared to follow the first.  They moved all the way across the horizon in a matter of minutes.  These were certainly not boats or any aircraft that we’ve ever seen.  No boat or aircraft moves or behaves the way these lights did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I also saw one giant flash of white light near the area where the two smaller white lights originated.  My husband described this flash as looking like a strobe light: quick, round, and intensely bright.  It did not appear to be lightning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best friend is not a believer in aliens or UFOs, but even she has absolutely no explanation or guesses as to what we saw tonight, particularly the original orange orbs of light.  They were absolutely quiet, and moved in such a smooth, orderly way.  These were not airplanes, meteors, Chinese lanterns, satellites, fireworks, or any of the typical guesses that people give.<n>

I was sitting in the passenger seat looking out the window into the dark woods when suddenly I see this bright, bright green light pass over the windshield from the left to the right, right over the tree line, I didn&#39;t know what shape it was all I know is that it was a big green ball. I didn&#39;t think nothing of it at first, then I brought my face to my window to look again and it was hovering right above the trees. I immediately lost my breath, my heart stopped and literally did not know what to do or say, I kept my eyes on it while trying to get the driver to look and see what it was and he&#39;d seen it too, by then we were both freaking the heck out, then the aircraft just darted away into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The person in the back seat hadn&#39;t seen anything particularly because he was laying back in the seat. After about an hour of dr! iving I then noticed the same object in the sky except this time there was 2 more of them following at LEAST 30 feet off the ground, the light was too bright to make out the shape yet again, both of the other flying objects were white in colour, we were just so confused and scared that we did not know what to do, this was just before we&#39;d entered Brainerd, MN, then I tried turning on the camera on my DROID X but my phone shut off and it was fully charged!!  It would NOT turn back on for anything, even after I put the car charger in!  I don&#39;t know if it had something to do with what we&#39;d been seeing but it just freaked me out the whole way back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then, I hadn&#39;t seen anything but I&#39;ve been paying much more attention to the night sky while I&#39;m traveling and outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

This craft was traveling from McKenna toward Kahului; which would be moving toward approximately direct North. Seen from The 2nd floor porch of Maui Hills condos  approximately 1:30 AM or 3:30 A.M..  In the blink of an eye, passed - was a very bright orange light beneath a diamond shaped craft, couldn&#39;t tell, but light seemed to flash, and the light was intensely bright, but not like a laser.  Low enough and close enough to seem to pass and travel past the field of vision, by going past from the observer&#39;s diagonal angle, right to left and pass out of sight by going past and behind the building toward Kahului, Maui, HI.  My question is why did it want to be seen in a populated area, in the middle of the Pacific?<n>

It was 23:00hrs. I was out in my backyard having a cigarette before bed. I was looking at the stars when I noted an obvious satellite travelling along a SSW to NNE vector. It passed just parallel along the bottom of the entire length of Ursa Major.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s when a large pulse of light caught my eye a bit further east of the satellite.  It was a large bright pulse or flash of white light. I scanned for it expecting to see a plane and its running lights.  I couldn’t hear any engines since I expected it to be a small private plane at lower altitude given the size of the flash.  Thinking that the pilot was turning the interior lights on and off. I couldn’t see any usual running lights.  Then (about 10 or 15 seconds after the first flash) there was another flash or pulse, which took place in another spot further along what appeared to be a linear course, travelling away from my position. It was running in a SSW to NNE direction and lower in the sky.  A third flash occurred, the time between flash/pulse 2 and 3 was roughly about the same time between flash/pulse 1 and 2. It had no real shape that I could see, but was brilliant.  From what I could determine, the speed of this second object was constant.  After the third flash, there w! as nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was scanning the sky in that area I noted yet another light. Higher in sky.  It was a bright orange and larger in size to the satellite I first saw.  It too was travelling in the same direction as the first satellite and it followed basically the same course until it faded out. I am imagining that that was a satellite as well but never saw a brilliant colour of orange like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear. There were no lights on in the backyard. Stars and constellations were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes after seeing the flash I even saw an actual airliner travelling west to east that was passing close to my position but a bit further south.  It had its running lights on and could faintly hear its engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been watching planes at night for years and know the usual flight paths of both commercial and private aircraft in the area.  I have also seen many natural phenomenon like fireballs, falling stars, etc.  I can&#39;t really tell what this 3-flash event was.<n>

Once outside, we noticed multiple, small blinking lights in the sky, some singly, some moving in pairs.  Then we saw 4 much larger sets of lights moving across the sky, 2 were triangular in shape and very large and 2 more sets of lights following at a distance.   The triangular UFO&#39;s were very bright and almost looked as if they were glued together, very close to each other with one immediately behind the other, moving fast across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed them through binoculars and you could make out the triangular shapes, each with 2 white and one red light, none were blinking.  The 2 sets of lights following at some distance, were each double lights, one white, one red, neither blinking and were moving at the exact same speed as the triangle lights and in the same direction.   All of these objects were moving much faster than commercial jets fly, going horizon to horizon in about 30 - 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was the sound of a jet coming from the direction of the last set of trailing lights, but sounded like it was even farther back than the last set of lights.  The large triangle shaped lights in the front outlined an enormous object, much bigger than an airliner (8 - 10x larger than a commercial jet) would normally appear at cruising altitude.  A number of air routes cross over our town, but commercial jets are always at very high altitudes here as we have 13,000 ft peaks just outside of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are no airports within 100 miles that can anything larger than a Learjet can land at, so it is unlikely that a large commercial jet would be flying at 5,000 ft above us (our town is at 7,500 ft).  There were no clouds in the sky that we could see and we spend a lot of time sky-watching normally, we own 2 telescopes and use them frequently).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a founding member of the Alliance Studying Paranormal Experiences (ASPE) a New Mexico Paranormal group and I spent 20 years working in Science before moving to Taos.  I am a trained observer and have seen a number of unusual object in the night sky over the years, this sighting was the most remarkable I have seen yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the 4 large objects flew away, the small blinking and moving lights, more than 20 of them by our estimates, persisted for another 15- 20 minutes and were visible in multiple directions.  One member of our group became very frightened and insisted we all go inside as it looked like several of the lights were moving directly at us.<n>

I continued to drive north and pulled over a few times to look at it and try to keep it in view.  It was moving in the opposite directon as me, so it was pretty hard to keep up with it.  I saw one of my students waiting at a bus stop and stopped to talk to him, but I was looking up the sky the whole time.  He asked what I was looking at, I told him there was a strange light in the sky so he looked up also.  By then, it started to move a lot faster and gained altitude until it literally disappeared.  I looked no bigger than a distant star when I last saw it, then I lost it in the sky.<n>

That was on our way into New Town, ND from Hwy 83 traveling on Hwy 23.  We stayed in New Town for 15 or so and on the way back down 23 we spotted it agian.  The sky is clear!! No clouds!! Then we realized there we more than one. There was another one behind us.  They would fade in and out.. I know this sounds really crazy but at one point it looked like the Eiffel Tower was infront of us!!  Like a hologram!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are both from Texas and have seen a funnel cloud or dirt storm (or a funnel cloud of dirt) but this was different.  We both of sound mind and do not drink or do drugs.  Our eyesight is great!

It caught my attention because there were 3 flashing lights, 2 red on the outside and a white one in the middle.  The outer red lights were blinking as it began going to the right.  Then making no visible turn stopped and began going to the left.  The outer red lights then flickered out one a time and the white light seemed to get brighter.  At this time I could no longer make out the shape of the craft, just see the bright white light.  There was no sound. It looked like a star, very low, directly above the treeline and it moved to my left (West) very slowly across the sky.  Then it faded like it was never there.  Directly after the light faded 2 planes flew in the same direction from the same distance and I could visibly see all the lights on the planes.  They did not fade out as the previous object had.<n>

It seemed far away but it looked fairly large so there could have been more than one craft but it was probably just one.  I don&#39;t know if this was a UFO or some sort of strange late night publicity stunt.  At first glance I thought it was moving, but upon further scrutiny I saw that it was just hanging there.  I&#39;d love for this one to be debunked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up and saw a redish light about the size of a star moving very fast from WSW and then make a sweeping u turn and head back the direction from which it came.  There was a jet in the sky at the same time, so it was easy to judge the speed as being easily five or six times faster thn the plane.  When I first saw it I thought it must be a satellite, but then it made that u turn and headed in the opposite direction at an amazing rate of speed.  This is the first time I&#39;ve seen a UFO.

There was an orange circular object in the sky and it appeared to be quite large.  It travelled from the east to the northwest, and as it travelled it rapidly became visually smaller.  As it travelled, at one point it dipped down, went east for a moment, then went back to travelling towards the northwest.  The size at first from the ground looking up was between dime and nickel sized  (Far too large to be a satellite, planet or star) and reduced to a mere pinpoint of orange light, then we could not see it anymore.<n>

Based upon the location, I assumed it was military as the coloration was different and appeared in the same vicinity from my vantage point as Moffett Field in Mountain View, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon assent, it was apparent that the object was a missile of sorts as it had a distinct amber trail.  As it climbed in elevation, the relative perceived speed provided a clue the object was much further away that originally thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appear to reach the upper atmosphere and the object&#39;s propulsion begin to lighten in intensity and then disappear.  I then asked two family members to witness the remaining two launches.  I believe this was probably launched from a vessel at sea given the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appears the path was due South from a launch point somewhere near the Farallon Islands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t believe this was extra terrestrial, just some sort of military testing however I can&#39;t believe I would have been the only one seeing this as there was plenty of commercial and private aircraft traffic airborne at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now at least there is one documented sighting.<n>

Our binoculars aren’t that sophisticated, but it doesn’t look like a plane.  It just looks like a bright star that is changing colors very rapidly.  I can’t focus my binoculars well enough at that distance or zoom far enough to make out a shape.  The first time we saw it last week, it was in the southwest sky.  Tonight, it is in the east.  It is about half way up in the sky.  It hasn’t moved or flown away or disappeared while we are watching it.  We eventually go inside, so I don’t know how long it lasts.  We watched it about 10-15 minutes tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Vega?  PD))<n>

They were about the size of Jupiter maybe slightly larger. I didn&#39;t automatically think UFO, I actually thought huh, a new street light?  It was hard to really stare and get a good look while driving but I tried and I realized that whatever it was, was not a street light.  I couldn&#39;t make out many details but this is what I observed: 5 or 6 bright white lights that were round, looked like stars and were about the size of jupiter maybe slightly larger.  There was one in the middle and I believe 5 that surrounded it. All the same size.  They reminded me of fireflies, they were not completely stationary but fluttering.  The ones on the outside were almost dancing around the middle one which stayed relatively still.  The other thing I noticed was that I couldn&#39;t really tell if they were close or far away.  Definitely closer than s! tars but much farther away than the trees but where exactly in-between those two was really hard to tell. Just a side note...i was skeptical to believe it was a ufo...i hear about these things all the time but to actually see one...  I drove the same streets the next night to see if there was in fact a new street light or any lights in the same spot and nothing.  Did anyone else see it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

As I watched them the arc formation of lights began to shift closer to one another.  There were 4 lights that moved close together forming a diamond momentarily (indicative of a helicopter or aircraft losing altitude rapidly in formation flight) and one additional light nearer (higher on the horizon). They changed their formation while moving north, toward me.  At this point I was out of my car and walking toward the lights, south along the street. The way the lights changed formation they appeared to hover and move slowly as a helicopter might, but there were no white anti-collision lights.  Al! l of the lights were a bright red with a slight tinge of orange and after the movement of the lights occurred some began to grow dim.  As I walked closer I expected they would soon pass directly overhead or nearby, but by the time I reached a tall group of pines that were obscuring my view all of the lights had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former Army helicopter pilot, Chief Warrant Officer (retired 2007), and what I saw does not make sense. Because of the size of the lights I should have been able to hear the aircraft, were they rotor or fixed wing, but I heard nothing. It was a cloudless night sky as many stars shone brightly surrounding the area where I viewed the lights. After walking back to my car I immediately looked at the clock and it showed 2118hrs. I estimated it took me about 5 minutes to walk to the spot where I realized the lights had vanished and return to my vehicle.<n>

I thought there was a car accident and when I came out she pointed to the Northern sky and I seen red lights that flashed and seemed to float up and away from each other slowly.  They were all lined up with the highest one Northwest and the lowest Southeast. She said they were all clumped together when she seen them at first and they started to move in a line formation.  Then we seen an airplane coming from the direction of O&#39;hare Airport and move in towrds the 2 lowest lights at which time they disappeared.I&#39;ve lived here all my life and living next to O&#39;hare airport I know what a plane looks like but I have never seen anything like this in my life.<n>

I decided to pull into an empty parking area and get a good look.  When I looked east again, there were 2 more in the sky heading west.

Clear blue sky back round.Distance was great very high in the sky, actually made it look small. Description of craft: Shape: Triangle. Composition: all 3 sides of the triangle looked like white cloudy field that held its straight line shape to form the triangle.  But the white cloudy field did have fluctuation and movement within itself like a shifting and re-arranging constant.  At the top where the two longest sides of the triangle met was a very bright round shinning prism of beaming light.  Craft stayed stationary but made movement in its one spot.  Oddly enough it was as if it was putting on a show.  The craft looked as though it was flipping (turning) slowly in a timed sequence over and over again.  Each time it would flip backwards away from me the prism light went out of sight then return once it was flipped toward me and back at the top of the triangle.   Also the white cloudy fields that made the triangle line configuration would slightly dissolve themselves but immediately return their shape and consistency while craft was in motion turning over a flipping over.  It seemed it was getting smaller  and farther away as the minutes passed.  It then slowly seemed to go to a range distance I could no longer view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I woke up at 2:30 am to go to the bathroom and looking across the field about 50 yards away in the tree line I first saw 3 white lights they were like a soft white but bright at the same time they would appear then disappear quickly. Because I just woke up I though just stand here for a while and make sure you are not just seeing something so I stood there for about 2 minutes and the lights increase some really high and low they would be bright then go out I could see a trail on some of them. I got kind of scared because all of a sudden there were a lot of them and at that time one of our dogs that was outside started barking, so I got her and went in the tent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was in the tent all I could think was I sure hope someone else is seeing this. I laid there for about 15 mins then another one of our dogs that was in the tent next to me started growling and barking not constant just every couple minutes, he got out of his tent and came into mine which had the other dogs and when he came in, the tent door the stayed cracked and then I started to see a laminating light coming through the crack in the door and laminating the tent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I laid there for about 15 minutes and watched.  Still hoping someone else was seeing this. I did want to go out or even open a window, but at this time I had 3 dogs in my tent and I really didn’t want to get them all going crazy and barking , but looking back now I wish I would have went back outside and observe what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the morning I was the first up and when my sister woke up I asked her if she got up last night she said she woke up and I said did you go outside she said no.  I started to tell her when I woke up to go to the bathroom I saw these lights right way she says I saw something laminating my tent and I heard Lucy bark and I thought you were up walking around with a flash light.  Then she said &amp;quot;I was trying to figure out what you were doing and I was thinking to myself why is she starting the fire again&amp;quot;.   After exchanging the complete story with her and all the other campers I am convinced what I saw was some kind of phenomenon that I can&#39;t even began to explain.<n>
5/13/12 02:30|Pisgah Forest|NC||1 hour|Saw many white lights about the size of grapefruits in the tree line while camping in North Carolina|5/29/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88964.html|315|ndxe201205| Extremely Large Triangluar Craft Travelling at Enormous Rate of Speed<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a first hand account from one of the observers:  Just after Midnight local time while driving Westbound on Interstate 40, approximately 20-30 miles east of Williams, AZ an extremely large object or objects (0.75 - 1.25 miles wide) consisting of three circular white lights in a triangluar formation was observed travelling due West at an unbelievable rate of speed (3000+ MPH).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the sighting was very brief, lasting only 1 - 1.5 seconds, it was concluded that the object or objects were either entering or leaving the atmosphere due to the direction of travel and angle from the horizon. The size and speed were approximated by comparing their size in the night sky relative to the distance from the observation point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sounds were heard and the object(s) did not leave any trail(s). It was 1 and 1/2 hours before moonrise, without a cloud in the sky.  Visibility was excellent, and light pollution was virtually non-existent. It was too dark and the object or objects travelling too fast to verify the shape or outline of a craft, or whether is was three distinct crafts flying in formation, but both witnesses believe it was one craft with three propulsion devices aligned in a triangluar formation since the distance between the three lights remained constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just prior to the sighting, I-40 Westbound was closed for over 1 hour due to a tractor-trailer truck fire, and the sighting occurred 15-20 miles West of the truck fire, about 15 minutes after the road was re-opened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both witnesses described the exact same event whereas the object seemingly traveled from one point to another in the sky along a Westward linear path, without leaving any path or trail in between the two instances in which it was seen.  It&#39;s not known whether or not this &#34;jumping&#34; from one point to another seemingly instantaneously is because the object was simply travelling too fast to be properly observed by the unaided eye or because of some other reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two witnesses each saw the object independent of one and other and both were equally as awestruck, dumbfounded, and unsure of exactly what they had seen.<n>

At first I thought it was a star but it was an overcast night and there were no other stars visible.  As I approached I saw it changed colors methodically from white to yellow, orange, then red with no flashing just a constant star-like light  changing colors about every second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized it was not like anything I have ever witnessed. It illuminated the cloud cover that was apparentl y just above it. I slowed and heard nothing that would indicate a craft such ad helicopter as it was apparently hovering in one spot.  As I passed, I kept my eye on it in the rear view mirror for about 15 seconds then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reluctantly contacted the local sheriff&#39;s department to inquire about any other sightings of the light or poss...ible aircrafts in the vicinity.

I kept seeing a very bright light on my  left,drivers mirror but no actual light in the mirror itself.  In the rear view mirror there was no vehicle nor light of any kind.  On the right mirror side I saw the shine of light around my mirror as well periodically.  I felt like a vehicle was following my SUV.  Only when I asked the friend if he could see this vehicle did we see for a short while one bright light and one small yellow light in the right mirror.  My friend said looks like it could be a car with only one light then it did not show up in the mirror.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived at the Lagoon a minute later and pulled in I did not notice the vehicle go by but assumed I had missed it or it had stopped on the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat and talked awhile and all of a sudden two blue lights (very blue) were gliding smoothly over the ocean towards the USA. I could not see if the lights were attached and if so the craft would have had to be very big or if they were individual crafts.  It was very dark out.  These lights were very low to the water, travelled without noise, were not at all erratic in movement and did not move the water surface.  The water surface was lit in large spots by lights from the Shipyard/Dockyard which was quite a ways away but are so high they light up the water at a distance and no disturbance showed on the water by the blue lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights were a fair distance apart did not blink at all and seemed to travel one behind the other simultaneously.  All known craft do not seem to fit into what we saw.  Helicopter or hovercraft should have exhibited noise, or water movement or both.  Planes do not travel that smooth nor do helicopters.  Too smooth also for speedboats.  The speed also does not fit any other craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights disappeared as they got close to the USA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have mentioned the lights on my car as they may have been some anomaly as well as I can not figure why on such a curvy road I was unable to catch glimpses of a vehicle or at least some light in the rear view mirror or a beam in the side mirror not just around it.<n>

That&#39;s when I saw 4 or 5 amber sphears creating a diamond and 3 or 4 traveling behind creating a triangular shape.  They were just drifting yet faster than airplanes and smoothely headed north dissapering into the fog.  They came from the west low then rose it seemed as they headed north.  Other then the first 2 booms there was silence.  I have lived here long enough to know these where not normal airplanes,however Camp Penalten is north of us so maybe they were military.

About 10:15 PM I mentioned that the moon is right now very close to the earth in its orbit and do you want to go outside and look at it?  First we went out to the back yard, but the trees did not allow much open area to see the sky.  We then went to the front of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Facing North and just a little bit to my left was a bright white light.  I mentioned that it was probably a small private airplane.  It looked about 3 to 5 thousand feet up.  We did not really dwell on the light.  Then we realized that it had not moved.  First thought was that it might be a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked if they had a pair of binoculars.  He came back with a 7 X 30 pair.  You could see that it was a cluster of lights and not one bright singular light.  I told them that I was going home and us my 10 X 40 pair of binoculars to see if it was any clearer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My binoculars did make the sighting clearer.  It was a cluster of about 35 bright white lights in the shape of a sphere.  Each light was connected to another with a rod or shaft.  These white rods were also just as bright as the lights.  It is now about 10:35 PM and the object has not moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A neighbor was walking his dog and asked what I was doing.  I said that I was looking at a UFO.  He said, “yeah, right”.

Approximately 1 minute later another red object came towards my direction and it too gradually diminished as if the light faded just to the east of me sitting on the patio.  The object was larger than a star and I notice a little white light with the red. At 9:52 pm, the 3rd red lighted object came and my sister said take a picture so I attemtped to on my phone but it didn&#39;t work.  It spooked me out so I came in to find a number to call but couldn&#39;t find a number in the phone book.

I saw 4 red lights in formation coming from SW @ ~230 degrees on compass.   My GSP is North 30.31 degrees, West 089.27 degrees.  No official record was available (I had tried to reach FAA to get velocity of wind direction, etc., but could not get, as they did not answer), but it was a calm night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were helicopters until I noticed a steady red light.  To the naked eye, the diameter of the light appeared to be 10 times the size of the brightest star in the sky.  There was absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first two pair were coming side by side (two in the front, two in the rear), about 100 yards apart.  The second pair was on the same flight path.  Following them were at least 10 more in a straight, staggered formation, on the same flight path, coming over the horizon of trees.  They were spaced apart ~100 yards.  Estimated speed was 50 knots.   Still there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first two pair ascended slowly into the sky vertically.   As they gained altitude the light grew dimmer, and then they up &amp; disappeared, there was cloud formation that evening, and that could have contributed to their disappearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 9:40 p.m. CT -- I ran into the house to get my car keys so that I could drive and get a better look--it took about 20 seconds.

I was with my boyfriend on our way to pick up my dog at the veterinary hospital I work at.  The location is Harkey Rd. and Broadway St.  We were in the turning lane on Broadway waiting to turn left onto Harkey Rd. when I looked out of the driver side window and saw two balls of red orange and yellow lights in the night sky.  It was very dark outside.  The sky was black with no clouds.  The lights were flickering but you could always see one of the colors.  I am an avid sky watcher I live less than 20 miles from a very busy airport and am always looking at the airplanes and for those blinking red and blue lights to be sure.  The lights I saw were nowhere near what I see on a regular basis when I go outside at night.  They caught my eye because there were two of them and they started out with the right one higher than the left however when I reached to get my camera they were already flying at the same height in seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were positioned over a neighborhood located on the right side of Harkey Rd. which goes south.  They appeared to be farther out than right above the neighborhood.  I recorded video footage that shows them flashing on and off and hovering next to each other. They stayed in this position for approximately 2 minutes.  We pulled into the parking lot of my work with the front of the vehicle facing east.  The objects were southwest so I had to turn my head to look out the window. I was still recording them at this time but in the video you couldn’t make them out any more so I turned it off.  I could still see them with the naked eye but they were dimming.  They were still in the same position as before.  We pulled further into the parking lot, and in the ten seconds it took to do that while looking away, the lights were now higher in the sky and positioned straight south directly in my view of the passenger window, with the front of our vehicle still facing east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were now further apart with one below the other.  I watched one and my boyfriend watched the other.  I didn’t know we were watching the different lights until about 15 seconds later the light I was watching disappeared and appeared to head straight south.  The one my boyfriend was watching zoomed east in what he described as “hyper-speed”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Update:  On 5/14/12 at approximately 22:45 hours we were driving east on Broadway St. a few miles from the location of my original sighting two days ago.  I noticed an orange light looking out of the passenger window southeast.  In the few seconds it took me to lean forward and look to my right where the orange light had been it was gone.  It was located in the same vicinity of my last sightings.  I also noticed an airplane was flying southwest at the same time I saw the orange light.  They were a considerable distance apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My father, mother and I went out to look and saw three reddish orange lights flying more or less in a row.  They were bright and appeared to be about the same brightness and size as Venus. It was a still night, but we couldn’t hear any sound.  They flew towards the northeast and were visible for about five minutes before they passed one at a time into or over a cloud.  It wasn’t possible to determine how high they were flying.  They seemed to be flying about as fast as a typical plane does and weren’t flying in an unusual fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I thought that there was a single light associated with each object.  My father thought there might have been three lights, but all a reddish orange hue.  He also felt that the objects were oriented diagonally to the ground.  The lights didn’t blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had wondered initially if they might be fire balloons, but after watching them, I felt that they were moving like guided craft, not subject to a breeze.

It didn’t look like an airplane so I just continued watching it when another object appeared in the sky, fairly close together.  As those were moving westerly the third one appeared.  It also had a very bright pinkish/red light, almost fire like.   I called my fiancé to hurry and look at too.  The first two objects had moved out of eye sight rather quickly but the 3rd object hovered for a few seconds before moving Westerly.  The light was no longer visible but the object was.  I looked through the binoculars to view the object before it completely disappeared.  The object was dark, oval looking in shape.  My fiancé took photos as quickly as he could, hoping to get a shot of this odd object in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When we got to the on-ramp to Main St/ County 14, we were at the light at the top of the bridge facing southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my right in the southwest sky I then saw at approximately 10:01, 4 red lights fly up from the horizon, then 3 more a second later following behind. They came up in a scattered sort of line, like a massive roman candle but a little quicker in pace of appearance. One went higher up in the sky, a set of three formed a near equilateral triangle to the bottom right of the first,  and the last set of three formed a very wide obtuse triangle to the immediate right of the first triangle. They were as bright as Jupiter was during its peak this year, glowing red with just a little bit of yellow around them, but they were a significantly larger source than Jupiter. They were a solid source of light, and they were moving visibly east and began to cross HWY 65. I watched them disappear behind the buildings as we turned and traveled north, but when I got home a minute later I ran inside to get my boyfriend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we went back outside all 7 were dimly visible from my parking lot due south and much smaller- the light source size was a third and they were just pricks of light, no longer glowing. To be seen from here they must have traveled over at least 1000 feet east and crossed over HWY 65 in approximately 3 minutes. The wide obtuse triangle vanished very quickly as soon as we got outside, as if it just blinked out. The high light and the equilateral triangle began to fade very rapidly and were gone in about a minute, as if they were traveling directly away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surface wind speeds in Blaine this evening at 10 PM were calm to 4/mph W.

I live on the 4th floor here in Koganei, a suburb in Far West Tokyo and have a great view. I can see Mt. Fuji and have an almost 180 view facing West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 5-5:30 PM and I saw in the distance, location at about 11, a glowing orange ball. It was very tiny, and at first I thought it was a plane reflecting the light o the sun. I have seen that before, but turns out that wasn’t it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back in to the apartment to replace the rug and came back outside to look at the orange ball. It looked like a plane that was on fire, falling from the sky, but very slowly. It continued on the same path, and it seemed to get larger. No smoke though, and only a slight glowing trail behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch it for another few minutes and it kept getting bigger. It was coming in from the SE to NE direction, all silent. It was still quite far away, but obviously glowing and not a plane. I got binoculars, the good ones, and it was an orange ball of light. No plane visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my husband out to look, and he said it must be a plane, but it really didn’t look like the planes he has seen, so he said it must be reflecting the sun. He doesn’t believe in strange things in the sky, but as I continued to watch it,  and nag him about looking, too, he came out and said, well, it could be  meteorite or maybe a satellite burning as it fell. He went back inside, nothing more for him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed and watched it and then it made a turn ! A left turn, and it appeared to head due West. At that point I knew it was neither a meteor nor falling satellite, so maybe it was a plane. Back to the binoculars – still orange, still a ball, but got smaller and smaller until it finally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what I saw, but it was lovely and exciting all the same. My background is as a professional international educator. I am 60, female, and a watcher of the sky. I believe you will never see anything if you don’t look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I approached the intersection of 183rd and Studebaker Road and stopped in the secured left hand turn lane. As I was waiting for the light to turn green, I suddenly saw a silver object in the sky.   It was oblong/cigar shaped and perfectly symmetrical.  It seemed metallic because the sun was reflecting off its outer hull. Today was about 80 degrees with clear blue skies. No buildings, telephone poles etc. obstructed my vision.  I focused my eyes to see any evidence of wings or other noticeable features it would have with common aircraft.  It had no bolts or apparent fastenings, just seamless metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 3,500 feet to 5,000 feet in the sky, the normal range where most aircraft fly. My window was ajar and I could hear no sound (as one would with a normal plane).  It left no air trail in the sky. I tracked it for about 60 seconds from right to left (it seemed to be heading west) and it suddenly disappeared.<n>

As it crossed over the eastbound lanes of 495, it changed its courseand also increased its speed, and started heading west, alongside the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was definitely not an airplane or helicopter of any sort (I fly in small planes frequently), and appeared to be glowing orange-yellow; my initial description to my friend on the phone was “fireball&amp;quot;, but as it flew over, I was directly under it, it didn&#39;t appear to be on fire so much as glowing.  It could have possibly been a large hot air balloon, except it changed course very quickly, and also sped up, which seems unlikely.  It also maintained altitude for the 1 minute or so that I saw it.  THere were many other cars on the highway at this point, so I suspect other people should have seen this too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the minutes before I saw this object, I saw a meteor fall in the area; just after I saw the object, I saw another meteor.<n>

I was one of 3 people who were grouped together to have a picture taken,  and the rest of the group were sitting in a circle around the fire.  Movement in the sky caught my eye and I looked up to see what it was.  A bright greenish blue ball of light with an orange colored tail was shooting across the sky.  I shouted &amp;quot;Look! look! look!&amp;quot; and each member of the group followed where I was looking.  We all watched as this object shot across the sky and out of our direct view in an East to West direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will attempt to put it into perspective.  As I am looking out at the Southern sky, picture it as the top half of a clock (9 to 3).  The view of the first 1/3 of the sky is obscured by a garage and trees.  The object comes into view for me at about 11 o&#39;clock and travels across the sky and is out of view by 2 o&#39;clock. The object made no sound.  This whole encounter lasted only about 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recall having the time and foresight to call out &amp;quot;take a picture&amp;quot; as the object is at about the 1 o&#39;clock position, but the photographer is so mesmerized and shocked that she was unable to get a picture taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discuss and verify what we each saw.  Later, another couple came to the house.  We tell them what we saw and they both verify seeing the same thing from where they were in downtown Bemidji.  Their description was very similar to what we described and they were about 3-4 miles South of where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Trying to put the size of the object into perspective is difficult.  Two different groups described very similar objects yet were 4 miles apart.  So the object had to be quite large and quite far away.  Yet the object still looked quite large in the sky.  In comparing the size of a star or the moon as one looks up into the sky, I would have to describe the object as being about 1/4 the size of the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So besides the obvious, out of the ordinary color, this object was large enough to not mistake it for a shooting star.  I thought of a meteor because the orange colored tail made me think it would be hot, but it seemed to be maintaining its altitude as it shot across the sky, and not in a downward trajectory.<n>

We saw two lights on the craft, one at each visible end. The fuselage was a dark colour and looked very narrow but in a disk shape. The craft was descending over Chermside, QLD and it appeared to be almost rocking from side to side (almost like an aeroplane about to stall). It disappeared behind trees and the neighbours house but once we rushed to the front balcony to view, the craft had disappeared.  There was absolutely no engine noise whatsoever, no clouds in sky.  The night was clear and crisp.   Shortly afterwards we spotted a small jet that flew a similar route.  The craft we saw looked larger than the wingspan of a B747 (I work in aviation) and was flying too low. Any ideas??<n>

5/11/12 22:00|Knoxville|TN|Unknown|about 10to15 sec|May,11, 12 A cluster of lights were observed in the south sky over I75  at 22hundred hour traveling north|5/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/088/S88947.html|360|ndxe201205| Lights observed on ground  with smaller red light observed leaving and returning to larger lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 05/11/12 at about 2100 hours, myself (Sgt.) and two other officers were dispatched to an area east of Peach Springs, AZ. (Route 66 / Mile Post 110) in reference to a report of a green laser cockpit strike on a commercial aircraft at 22,000 feet.  We responded to the area and were unable to locate a source of a green laser.  Since we were we had not located anyone in the reported area, we then began to spread out and check the surrounding area of anything out of the ordinary.  One of the officers reported to me that he was seeing strange lights near the Grand Canyon.  Myself and another officer responded to an area on Route 66 / Mile Post 105.  At first glance, I observed lights out in the distance and was puzzled because lights should not have been located in the area they were being seen due to the remote and rough terrain.  I had recieved reports earlier in the week of a search and rescue effort that was being conducted by the Coconino County Sheriff&#39;s ! Office and I made contact with Search &amp; Rescue personnel and was informed that there was no search going on at that time and that what I was seeing was not anything they were doing.  I contacted the local Fire / EMS department and a paramedic and EMT/ Fire Marshall arrived at the scene.  They advised that they had no idea what it was and we came to the conclusion that what we were seeing was a landed UFO.  The Fire Chief arrived shortly afterward.  He has always lived in this area and knows the country very well.  He had no idea what the lights could be or how they could be where they were at.  We all stood at the roadside looking off to the Northwest at the lights. While looking at the lights, I observed the following: I observed that the lights at first numbered 5 and then at times 6 (the 6th light would sometimes stay lit as bright as the other 5 lights for long periods of time and then sometimes dim and then fade and go out).  They were large diameter round lights bluis! h white in color.  They seemed to have an aura around them and! seemed to light up the area where they were located.  I observed that the lights were arranged in a row and were evenly spaced.  While watching the lights I observed that a smaller red light would light up and then move away from the larger lights.  It would move around the area, and then return to the larger lights.  I watched most of this using 8 power Steiner binoculars.  The other officers also used their binoculars to watch the lights.  The group of us stayed there on the roadside for approximately an hour and then the fire and EMS personnel left and returned to quarters.  The other two officers left the scene and I stayed behind and continued to observe the lights.  I continued to watch as the lights continued to do as previously described.  I attempted to estimate the distance at which the lights were located but could not tell with any certainty.  If I had to make a rough estimate, I would say 10+ miles away and the lights had to be in an area of at least 100 yards.  The co! nditions at the time of sighting was: Clear, cool, dark /no moon, all quiet, air traffic and stars could be easily seen overhead and the glow of Las Vegas, NV could be seen in the distance.  I met again with the other two officers and we discussed an attempt to go and locate the lights.  One of the officers suggested that I contact the Arizona DPS helicopter and have them fly to the sight.  Due to the unknown circumstances and having no evidence that it was anyone in trouble or a crash site, I was reluctant to contact them and potentially put an air crew in possible danger.  We left the road side viewing area and proceeded to a nearby hill in an attempt to get a better view.  We were able to still see the lights, but not any better than where we first saw them.  We continued for the next few hours to locate a way to get to the lights, but were unable to do so.  I watched the lights again from the roadway and then left at the end of my shift on 05/12/12 @ 0200 hours.  I advi! sed the other officers to keep an eye on the lights and let me! know of any changes.  The other officers advised that the lights stayed where we saw them though out the hours of darkness.  On 05/12/12 at dusk, I again checked the area of the original sighting, and I could again see the lights.  I reported the sighting to another officer who had not been on the night before and advised them of what we had saw.  He came to the spot and observed the lights with me.  He advised that he wished to go and attempt to locate the lights and he and a officer from the night before attempted to locate the lights.  They were unable to locate the lights.  On 05/13/12 I brought a 30x spotting scope with me to work and again observed the lights off in the distance in what appeared to be the same location.  I could see the lights clearer and again observed 6 lights with a smaller red light leaving and returning to the larger lights.  The next day an investigator and a officer who had witnessed the lights on the first night attempted to locate the area again but ! were unable to get to the location.  As far as it is known, there is no way to travel to the location by vehicle.  When I returned to shift on 05/15/12, I found that the lights were no longer visible.  I spoke with the other officers who knew about the lights and they advised that the lights had been there on the 14th and in the same spot.  I have kept an eye on the area since the sighting and have not seen the lights since.  No explanation of the what the lights were or why they were there have ever been found.  Also no photographs were taken of the lights.  We did attempt to take photos, but due to the distance involved, they did not turn out.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We often see helicopters flying over headed to Pittsburgh so I watched it approaching.  As it got closer I noticed there was no engine noise, then I saw a second light exactly the same rising up behind it, followed by a 3rd and a 4th.   All tailing behind each other but each at a lower altitude.  As the first light was getting closer to me in the sky it also appeared to be going higher up until it vanished altogether.  The remaining lights all followed the same path upwards and vanished in front of each other.  This whole process lasted about 2 minutes.<n>

Martin County, NC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May the 12 2012 me and my girlfriend were on the way home from Greenville, NC when we saw something that still terrifies me to the core for I have never had such an encounter. I will not add anything at all and try to include everything that I witnessed. I am not aiming to fool or trick any one only to share what two people saw with someone who may care.  Before this encounter neither us have given much thought to alien aircraft or really believed in them at all. We would have most certainly taken pictures if my phones camera was funcional and my girlfriends wasn&#39;t dead, While on a  fairly average ride home after catching a movie, two bright red spheres shot across the sky probably around 200 feet in the air seemingly out of nowhere moving from the left side of the road to the right. The part that disturbed me was the fact of how close they were with respect to our vehicle and how there was no sound what so ever.  These two red orb-like objects were movingly alarmingly fast to not be making any sound at all.  After us initially seeing these objects they seemed to almost form into one (or maybe line up) and ascend to probably around 1100 feet at which point it stopped abruptly. It then appeared to be a rectangular shape almost like a cell phone tower light. I rule out this being a cell phone tower due to the fact that while there are towers through this area, none are red, they are all blue.  Once it appeared as a rectangle it simply warped into nothing, gone. I would like to shed a little light on the matter for someone else like me who would l! ike some kind of explanation. Thanks for your time.<n>

I thought it might be a CHP radar/air patrolling for speeders. I was trying to see the color {if it was black &amp; white}but could not tell. It was so shiny &amp; bright. I kept saying to myself &#34;what the hell is that??&#34;  It was flying slow like a helicopter would, kinda hoovering over the highway.  But then I thought that it probably wasn&#39;t CHP because it did not stay over the highway; it flew towards the mountains on my right.  When I came up to Casa de Fruita, there were at least 8 cars along that stretch that had pulled over.  Everyone was looking up to the sky; many taking pictures.  That was so weird. I thought no more of it.  When I got to work in Morgan Hill, I said to a co worker how odd it was about all these cars that were pulled off the road, looking to the sky.  That is when she told me about recent sightings of possible UFO&#39;s over Pache! co Pass.  Well...I saw it too. I have goose bumps.<n>

In began to gain altitude slowly as if rising in the wind, but then accelerated rapidly and rose up and away and was gone.  Before it disappeared from view I observed a white blinking light coming from it and at that point realized that it was a UFO! It made no noise.  It could not have been anything else.  Its shape was sort of fat and oblong from my nearly horizontal view of it while it was nearer to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly, there is a small electrical sub-station in the vicinity of where it appeared to have been traveling from.

My mother, father, sister and I were sitting on their front porch on a very clear, sunny day.  My sister first noticed a bright light in the sky and grabbed the binoculars to look.  It was visible with the naked eye.  She said it was flat cigar shaped -disappeared in thin air. I blew it off as a balloon or plane.  The object reappeared within minutes and I was the one to witness it appearance.  I asked my sister if she saw it and within seconds of asking her it disappeared.  Few minutes later we were baffled at what it was.  At that moment my sister and I saw two objects appear. One was super bright as if the sun was reflecting off metallic. My mother saw it at that time and said it was had to be bright due to her poor vision. My father and I looked through the binoculars and could see that it was cigar/missile shaped.  My sister also described it as flat and cigar shaped, bright silver in color.  One ! light drifted off and disappeared as fast as they appaeared.  There were several jets in the sky leaving contrails.  These objects left no trail at all. Just appearing and disappearing in thin air. One did move slightly as if in flight but would disappear!

This thing wasn&#39;t getting smaller as if moving away from me, or getting bigger as to be coming towards me.  It then suddenly veered to the right and disappeared. So weird.  I looked around and there was another one, it did start to get smaller so I thought, oh that is probably a plane, then, it just stayed there, and stayed there.  My kids had friends over, so I called them out,  I asked what they thought that could be, they said maybe a shooting star, I laughed and said, then why isn&#39;t it shooting, I told them to look close at the different color lights flashing and it&#39;s not moving.  One of the boys(and I think the others too) got scared, so I told them to just go watch their movie.  I went up and got my friend that is livi! ng with us, out of bed.  She was fascinated too.  She and I watched, while it stayed there for a long time, until we were so tired and went to bed.

This thing wasn&#39;t getting smaller as if moving away from me, or getting bigger as to be coming towards me.  It then suddenly veered to the right and disappeared. So weird.  I looked around and there was another one, it did start to get smaller so I thought, oh that is probably a plane, then, it just stayed there, and stayed there.  My kids had friends over, so I called them out, I asked what they thought that could be, they said maybe a shooting star, I laughed and said, then why isn&#39;t it shooting, I told them to look close at the different color lights flashing and it&#39;s not moving.  One of the boys(and I think the others too) got scared, so I told them to just go watch their movie.  I went up and got my friend that is livi! ng with us, out of bed.  She was fascinated too.  She and I watched, while it stayed there for a long time, until we were so tired and went to bed.  She also could see the Different color lights.We both could see that the lights were repeating, so came to the conclusion that they were moving around and around the object.  So strange!!

No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Time: 10:29/10:30  PM   May 10th, 2012, Tonight, just now...<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4 objects flying eastward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just gone outside to smoke a cigarette, and was thinking about normal things as these four lights caught my eye.  They seemed to be flying in formation, eastwardly, they all had a slight &#39;wobble&#39; as I would describe it.  These were not jets or meteors in my opinion as they seemed to be flying in a peculiar motion.  They were all headed in the same direction, but they were not flying with a trajectory that would be seen with airplanes, jet fighters or meteors, they all seemed to have an &#39;independent&#39; control, and a kind of peculiar &#39;wobble&#39; or that several of them, though in formation, headed in the same direction were moving slightly differently than the rest, they all seemed to be moving very fast, faster than jets, and the duration of this sighting would be &#39;seconds.&#39;  They literally disappeared all at the same time within seconds of catching my eye, within seconds of my sighting.  Again, they had this peculiar &#39;independent&#39; wobble, or as if each individual light were ab! le to move back and forth, side to side, planes can&#39;t wobble like that, at this speed they would have been ripped apart.  Meteors fly with a trajectory of motion and can&#39;t wobble back and forth like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is a cold 39 degrees outside here in Bozeman Montana, and I&#39;d find it hard to believe that they were &#39;ball lightening.&#39;  Strangest thing I&#39;ve seen in the sky. Don&#39;t know what else to tell you, perhaps someone else has seen this for a longer period of time than I did. I can&#39;t honestly say what to make of it at all. I waited a few minutes to see if anything would re-appear, but I saw nothing.<n>

I looked and saw from a distance something so bright that it almost appeared as if it had beams coming from it...similar to looking like a star with prongs.  She mentioned it had lights under it.  We called the neighbors to verify and they too said they saw the lights under it.  I reached for binoculars and could see many lights under the bottom of the craft. I handed my mother the binoculars and asked her to describe what she was...without my input so I could be positive we saw the same thing.  She verified the same description and mentioned it had &amp;quot;snakes&amp;quot; in between the lights.  Upon closer look...what she meant was in between the lights there appeared to be electrical sparks one light to the next...<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched the lights pulsate getting brighter and dimmer.  At times...it would turn sideways but you could still see the brightness of the lights but clearly it had changed positions.  It remained stationary for about an hour to 1 1/2 hours before moving to the northwest.  Finally, needing to retire to bed...I watched until about midnight.  My mother and neighbors are still talking about it!  I did report it to the police office.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a &#34;twinkling&#34; star, we suspect.

Aside from its gradual vertical descent there was no horizontal movement; the object did not appear to be heading in any direction except for straight down. This was particularly notable because there were airplanes in other areas of the sky during that time by which to compare this object, and while the other airplanes were headed in more obvious directions (toward or away from Boston Logan Airport just a few miles away), this object was altogether different. It was a bright white, spherical object that did not blink as most airplane lights do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a certain point the object stopped its descent and merely hovered there for several minutes. By this point I was in shock, and I watched this object for the entire duration of my car ride home which was just under five minutes. When I got out of the car near the Cambridge/Somerville line I noticed the object split into three smaller bodies of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three objects began flying away together in a triangle flight pattern, only to break it a few minutes later to fly around freely. They made sharp turns and seemed to be flying around a certain area near my neighborhood. By this point I was running down the road at top speed trying to record what I was seeing on my phone&#39;s video camera, but unfortunately the quality was terrible because cell phones simply can&#39;t film these kinds of events when it&#39;s pitch black outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into my apartment to retrieve my partner so we could go out together, but by the time we got outside 10 minutes or so later I couldn&#39;t find the objects again. I have been checking over and over for reports of this online with no luck which I find to be very shocking because prior to breaking up into three separate aircraft, the single body of light was so bright and moved so strangely in the sky I couldn&#39;t believe no one else had said anything about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a beautiful day, the sky was bright blue. I was watching birds flying by and then I began looking at the vast blue of the sky.  As my eyes adjusted to changing depths, an object caught my eye. It was a very small white orb. It appeared to be either emitting its own light, or reflecting the Sun&#39;s.  This is because it kept a constant color. At first I thought it might be a star or planet, since I&#39;m quite unexperienced with object of the sky. However, the longer I watched it, the more I realized how high in the sky it actually was.  This was in contrast to passing planes, which looked very small from my perspective, and were still obviously lower than the object.  I know this because at one point, the object moved behind some clouds that were passing by.  At this point I really noticed how erratic its movement was; it slowed down and sped up; it was also moving in different directions. As I was! watching this first object, I saw another one very close to it.  This one was moving much faster in the same direction as the first one, and there was yet another one following that one at the same speed.  It appeared as if the third one was chasing the second one, as they were moving erratically. After around 8 minutes, they were all completely covered by a passing cloud, and by the time it passed and I could see the blue background again-  I had lost all sight of the orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep in mind all of this was occurring at a very high altitude and in a very small zone of the sky, as the objects looked extremely small from ground level. Although the objects were moving extremely fast (much faster than any airplane that was passing by AND they were farther up), they were not making a scene. I myself have near perfect vision and unless I was concentrating perfectly on the level of altitude they were in, they would blur away and disappear. It happened a few times if I looked in another direction, finding them again was a matter of focusing on very small spots on the sky and looking for motion in the peripherals. This leads me to believe that UFOs are more common than we think during the day, yet they are so difficult to spot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Yesterday,  I stepped out to get my mail and a glint in the sky (like a small glint of metal) caught my eye.  I looked at it and saw an unusual object moving from right to left, very high in altitude and moving unusually slowly.

Was outside doing yard work and looked up to see a white jet flying south over the house, leaving a white trail behind.  Followed the trail and saw a large black object which at first I thought was a large hawk or crow as we leave in the country.  Noticed is was hovering, not actually traveling.  I then noticed their was no movement of the wings.  I called my 13 yr old daughter over to see and we watched this shape hover and slightly change direction for a few minutes.  It wasn&#39;t a plane as it had no noise, no trail and hovered.  Wasn&#39;t a bird as the wings never moved and it hovered way too long to be a bird.  Was not a helicopter.  My last thought was maybe a RC plane, but again no noise and stayed too still too long.  At once it made a turn toward the sun where we saw light reflect off it and then it made a 45 degree turn north and shot over the house in seconds it was out of sight.  We still talk about it o this day.  A! ny thoughts or ideas would be great!<n>

In the distance I saw a pulsating bright white light, flying fast and as high as a small aircraft would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw no shape to this lighted object. It was blinking; it blinked 3 times very quickly then moved forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not flying in a straight line, nor was its speed consistent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After its three pulsating blinks, it looked as if it took a new position, then the 3 blink’s before. Sometimes slightly higher or lower, or further ahead then the movement before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving very fast heading towards Steinbach Manitoba. I was driving as fast as I safely could, but it was soon far way in the distance. The blinking light was just as bright far way, as it was close up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noted that there was no smoke stream coming from the rear, nor was there any sound.<n>

The objects at no point in time made any sound whatsoever.  The objects were located above the ocean approximately 2 o’clock with respect to the horizon. The visibility that night was clear with a backdrop of clouds and stars.  The objects appeared to emit/disappear into the clouds themselves as though they were integrating themselves into the clouds when they turned on or off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Timeline:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  First minute of viewing: I observed one fireball stationary in the sky hovering for about 15 seconds appearing as one fireball.  During this time the fireball appeared to morph into a brighter red color giving birth to another fireball directly to the left of the first one creating two fireballs.  The second fireball morphed/gave birth to the third fireball.  The term gave birth to can best be described as originating from the first, then the second, and the second making the third.  For a total of three fireballs lined up horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  Second minute of viewing:  The three horizontal fireballs drifted into the 12 o’clock position in the sky, the other off to 3 o’clock, and the third moved up to 9 o’clock position.  The three fireballs repositioned themselves again and appeared in higher or lower positioning moving at a med-slow speed several more times staying in approximately the same area of the clouds but with different formations.  Then, the fireballs were observed to become integrated/dispersed into the clouds themselves as they disappeared into the backdrop of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)  Third minute of viewing:  The three fireballs came back on in completely different positions in the sky one at 10 o clock, the other at 5 o’ clock, and the other 11 o’clock.  The objects appeared to move up/down/side-to-side repositioning themselves in the clouds and looking as though they became absorbed by the clouds themselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4)  Forth minute of viewing:  After the lights went off they came back on within the span of about 2 seconds.  The three fireballs were located in completely different locations (with respect to before).  The objects appeared to move up/down/side-to-side repositioning themselves in the clouds before going off for the final time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They blinked three times then paused for a moment then blinked three times again before turning off for another few seconds and then blinking again.  They did this as they moved across the sky before disappearing from sight.  They were silent.  There were no other identifying lights of other colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot guess their altitude or distance from each other.  They did not move rapidly nor did they move slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never seen this before and thought it might be a military or other experiment in self-synchronous communication or a psychological experiment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After work in the spring and summer I sit in my gravity chair by the pool and watch the sky.  I live near the Fresno Yosemite Airport and I watch the planes and the satellites and clouds and stars.  It is relaxing and enjoyable.  I’ve seen all sorts of craft but never two independent objects behaving like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I looked out my garage door facing west. There still was a little daylight. I looked up at Venus and saw what I thought was another star. It was just as bright little above and north stationary by Venus.  I looked down at my light switch to turn it off and go in my house.  Then I remembered that Venus is the third brightest object in the sky. I looked back up at this object when I noticed it starting to slowly move to the north.  It started to pick up speed and faded out or twinkled before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have look all over the web trying to find out what it was with no luck.  I was hoping that if I post this event somewhere someone would say what it was or they saw also.  I live by 3 airfields Ogden-Hinckley Airport, Hill Airforce Base, and Salt Lake International so I am very familiar what aircraft can and can not do.<n>

I&#39;m a frequent airline traveler, always at a window seat.  About a minute after take-off from Phoenix airport, about 1500 ft AGL, I was looking out the window and saw a perfectly round, metallic(shiny) sphere below our plane, moving perpendicular to our flight path.  The sphere was possibly 500 feet below and moving probably close to our speed.  It was hard to figure out the size, but it was moving quickly and in a perfectly straight line.  This was not like any aircraft that I&#39;ve ever seen in the sky or have heard about.  Basically a large shiny ball bearing soaring through the sky.  No trails or hazes...  It was a perfectly sunny day with no clouds and calm sky&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Once I saw it it began to move towards the right into a group of trees and disappeared. It made no sound what so ever, but the light was so bright and strong it illuminated my room.  Although the orb was orange itself, it emitted a white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

I notice a low flying craft at about 300 hundred feet above the ground to my left thru drivers side window, I thought this is strange because there is a tall power line system that reaches at least 150 ft to 200 ft. off the ground in its path.  This craft was moving towards my direction left to right with the power lines directly in its path. It was not a plane its lights were yellow, no white, green, or red.  No flashing light either, just solid yellow. This was no plane or helicoptor, I turned raio off, open windows and slowed down, no traffic around but me so I was able to hear well, no sound from this craft as it past over my car.  This was a strange craft, I believe it was a U.F.O.<n>

I was driving, and I saw the flash above and ahead and slightly to the left of our vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving due west at that time on Centennial Blvd. in Springfield, OR, which means that the object was traveling from south to north.  The sighting lasted only a few seconds and ended when the object disappeared from view to the north (the treeline blocked our line of sight).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I afterwards agreed that the object was unlike anything either of us has ever seen before. I&#39;m familiar with Chinese lanterns, having seen plenty of them in the U.S. and Asia, and there&#39;s no way this was a Chinese lantern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve also seen plenty of shooting stars, and this object was &amp;quot;falling&amp;quot; much too slowly to have been a meteor. I use the term &amp;quot;falling&amp;quot; advisedly, because it did not seem to be in a natural free! fall. It was going down quickly, but it also seemed like it was floating.  The strange thing about this sighting is that I would describe the object I saw as orange, or orange-yellow, whereas my friend saw something green.  I don&#39;t know what to make of that discrepancy.  Neither of us had been drinking or using drugs.<n>

It&#39;s not full, but it&#39;s still quite big and bright. I missed the Supermoon on Saturday due to cloud cover. Tonight there are a few lines of clouds, but the sky is mostly clear.  As I was looking at the moon with my face pressed against the screen, I noticed a bright light out of the corner of my eye. It was approximately at 110 degrees azimuth and 40 to 45 degrees in altitude.  It was quite large compared to stars, about the size of airplane landing lights. It was about the same brightness as aircraft landing lights, although it had a slightly dimmer, slightly more orange tint to it. I&#39;ve seen many planes heading to Seatac coming from around that direction, do my first thought was that is what it is, but I quickly realized that this light appeared to not be moving. It was just sitting there.  I thought that was weird, and in my mind I said to myself, &#34;What the f*** is that&#34;.  As soon as I thought tha! t, it appeared that the light started slightly moving to the SE. It dimmed and blinked twice, then went out completely.  I went and wrote down my observations and then went back to the window to see if it would reappear, but after a few minutes it did not reappear, so I sent in this report.<n>

It seemed to be the mother ship, because three white lights came from it.  They were going above the tree line back and forth on the other side of the Hood Canal. Then we noticed two white lights above our heads.  They were moving side by side.  I&#39;m not really sure of exactly how many there were because they would disappear and reappear.  The one that was the brightest didn&#39;t go very far.  The smaller ones ventured out.  We have been watching for about one hour and my son and neighbors are still watching.  Its very exciting.<n>

Heard from a neighbor earlier that evening how big it was supposed to be.  It was big.  Looked around the sky, and opposite the moon was a  straight formation of circular lights, unmoving.   I thought they may be stars but they still looked odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for a minute or so and the lights seemed to get brighter, then dimmer, then brighter again.  It was very faint because it seemed pretty far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the lights moved together in a circular motion (blurred) and they disappeared very soon afterwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked around for a few minutes and did not find them again.<n>

We walked a few more steps out and looked up to see a small oblong orb that looked like it was on fire. There was a long black shadow that kept rotating around the fireball, dimming it as it passed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to grab my phone as my husband recorded with his phone. I have a video. When we watched it back, it appeared to suddenly move and then the fire part went out. Then it was just a black orb slowly moving until it was out of sight. We also noticed while watching the video a flashing light to the right of the orb we were watching. We had not noticed that flashing light while viewing the sky. Really freaked us out. The ladies down the street got in there car and drove away before we could talk to them. I really wish I had caught them to see what they thought of it.<n>

He was driving south on the main highway in Las Vegas.  He said: &#34;What is that?,&#34; and I turned to look up through the windshield.  There was a huge, oval shaped object that seemed almost dimly lit all around. It almost emitted a dim haze.  It was farther away in the distance by a mountain range outside of the city to the left of the highway.  There were two helicopters circling the object, shining spotlights on it.  We watched this happen for five minutes until the object was behind us. I turned to look and it was gone.  The helicopter then proceeded to shine spotlights on the mountain, and then they stopped.  This is the second report I have filed.  The last once was October of 2010 when I witnessed a V-shaped, form-changing object also in Las Vegas while with another witness.<n>

I drove to Waterbury Hospital on a hill to shoot towards the tower. I didn&#39;t really notice anything unusual. Just a clear starry night. I took the first photograph and somethig didn&#39;t hit me right. I looked at the back of the camera and there were specks on the picture. I sword I tripoded should of been clear. So I went to whip out a lens cleaner and a white car with a black gentlemen in an expensive suit drove up. He asked what I was doing? I told him,&#34; I wanted a night time shot of the Clock Twoer and Waterbury.&#34; He said,&#34;Oh, Alright then... Be careful&#34;. then drove off. I drove to several more locations taking photographs. I think I have these ojects in at least 10 photographs. I&#39;m a professional photographer. I have photographed at night. I repointed the camera and clicked off three more photos after the man left.  Then I left that spot.  Specks in all of them. I was disappoited! . Then drove to a street across the street from Kennedy HS:  Saw a view of the city. Took some shots. Also Off of congress st and that area.. In one of the photos  noticed what I thought was a thumb spot. With what looked like vapor coming from ehind the tree. I checked the lens it was clear. I Cotinued on my way to Wall St. I spent two hours photographing that night. I didn&#39;t go up to Holy Land the area spooked me so I turned around. I would shoot and something would just hit me wrong so I&#39;d back up take another shot. So many locations I have three shots of the same photograph. I just figured I sort it out when I got home. I got home looked at the back of the camera noticed the specks pulled it in. It wa 3:00am now. I thought I was seeing things. Went to ed put the photographs on the computer called teh newspaper. They said in light of what happened at Banta Lake two weeks prior they wanted to see the photos. I asked what happened? She thought I was kidding. I told her I do! n&#39;t watch much t or read the newspaper. I go to the library. I! &#39;m a rea der. She asked to see the photographs.I e-mailed them to the newspaper. She said there photographer said street light. I told them he didn&#39;t know what he was speaking about. She said wind dust motion. Then she said,&#34;I really think you need to send these off to nasa.&#34; I did. My friend directed me to this website and suggested reporting it. I didn&#39;t see anything unusual. Except a man in very well dressed at 11:30 pm. I have extremely good hearing. I was bothered that I didn&#39;t hear his car. Come or go for that matter. I also didn&#39;t recall seeing his car in the parking lot or leave it. Very unusual for me. Especially at that hour of night. When I would look up at the sky it just seemed like bright yellow stars. Maye a bit brighter than normal. But Not sure as we&#39;ve had so much rain; it could of just seemed brighter. When these photographs are blown up you can make out a ring of what appears to be bright light around a disk like object. I really thought it looked almost mirror im! age in one shot when I blew it up I realized there wre more. I intially thought 3-4. But I realized there were 9-11. I wen tout to get these photographs for my sisters website. Her book will be coming out in Jan. So I really needed these to be spotless. I just wanted city shots and go home. On some level I think I was processing something wasn&#39;t just right as I was gettig annoyed by the crap coming across the lens. It definitely made for a longer night than I anticipated. I can literally recall thinking; now I&#39;ve got extra work to photoshop this crap out of here! Great! Once I saw what I had I did&#39;t touch those photographs. That&#39;s it. Sorry not much help. It seems there are different shapes ad also from a photograph on your site I may have more of them than I originally thought in these photographs. Also, I didn&#39;t really hear anything. Other than it wa a very busy night for the police it seems. The sirenes were laring it seems all night long. Which was wierd. I don&#39;t really! recall seeing a lot of people out. But the cop cars were ever! ywhere i t seemed. Especially in the Wall Street and Cook Street areas of the city. I do rememer turning off the car radio because of static. Also, I did notice a lot of yellow and blue stars in the sky that night<n>

The distance and size of the object were not distance due to the speed, however, the light appeared to traverse approximately 3 degrees every second and flash 4 times at each second interval.  The light was only observed just a few degrees above the horizon between a building and a tree when the light flew out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was plain white of only moderate intensity but was not accompanied by any other light.

Within about 30 minutes the storm was about 10 miles from me with huge clouds billowing over, it was about this time 22:00 I noticed a very dull blue oval/ circular object just sitting there beyond the clouds and lightning...  I kept my eyes fixated on the object hoping that lightning would strike and help illuminate the object so I could see it better.  The odd thing was that this is the middle of the night, the object was not bright but it was distinctly blue in the night sky, almost like some kind of aurora... every time lightning would flash the object disappeared for about 1 minute and then returns to the same location in the sky.  It moved from left to right. after the object had been sitting there in the sky stationary for about 5 minutes lightning started crashing everywhere as the storm got closer to where I was at, bu! t this time I could still see the object, it never disappeared... this may sound crazy but then things got uncomfortably weird for me, being that I’ve had a sighting about 2 and a half years ago in Monticello Indiana.  But anyways, lightning started crashing around this object only though it was lightning I have never seen in my entire life.  The bolts that would flash were a nearly perfect cylindrical shape, no thunder at the time and minimal wind. after this &#34;circular flashes&#34; it appeared if the blue object had almost double it original size, yet still sitting there almost as if it had slowly transformed... these weren’t like average lightning strikes because the never went down and they never went up, just these circular flashes. By now the storm is starting to get bad but the object still remains, intrigued and wanting to continue to watch out I sit out there for about another 10 minutes still seeing these circular lightning bolts, my best description of the lightning wou! ld be that it was a fire orange color and when it&#39;d flash it w! as like an outline of a circle... the object eventually became its original size again about the size of an apple if you were holding it out in front of your face.. As I was packing up all my belongings to head inside I started to hear a humming sound, it wasn’t loud, a soft subtle hum. I looked back to the sky and I didn’t see the blue object anymore just 2-3 more of those &#34;circular lightning bolt” things, or whatever they were... I kept hearing these weird noises till around 2am in the morning, these humming sounds and a few other sounds I can’t quite describe… it was very bizarre and left me feeling very uncomfortable… I’m not sure why because things like this I’ve always had a high degree of interest in, and when I had my first sight back in Monticello it was exhilarating absolutely amazing, but this time.. This time gave me a sense of worry. i will do my best to illustrate what i saw and send that in an e-mail.<n>

I though my eyes was playing tricks on me after walking out into the dark, so I waited to see if it was a jet or planted or whatever. after only a sec in the dark my eyes had adjusted and I could see this bright flashing light had a red green and blue type colored light flashing and spinning around the outside of it. it was hovering in the sky and every few mins it would move side to side and looked as if it was shooting out some type of light or lazier beam.  I took two videos with my cell phone but was not sure if anything was going to show up because nothing showed up on my cell phone screen while i was shooting the video&#39;s.  after a lil over 30&#39;mins &#34; Im thinking &#34; tha &#34;light&#34; shot across the sky and was gone.. I come inside and got my ipad to see what stars or plants were in the sky in the spot where the UFO had been. I was already at a loss for words, the constellation Orion was the exac! t spot the UFO had been in and the direction it flu off in. so I put the SD card from my cell in my laptop and open my videos, I find the one I just took at the bottom of the list, number 33. the bright light i saw the hole time only shows up in the video as flashes a few times but the thing i dont understand and kinda freaks me out is after 5 or 10 sec in the video its big flashes of light and stuff, i dont know what to call it, light, flying at the camera. im going to take another video in the dark just to make sure my camera/cell dont do anything thing odd shooting in the dark. it seems all a lil corny, constellation Orion ,Video 33.

My heart immediately jumped, I asked myself &#34;what is that?&#34;  It was coming toward me at a high rate of speed.  As it did it was jerking right to left. It appeared to gain speed while moving toward me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my oldest boy to come look, and asked him what he thought it could be. He was immediately shocked. Said &#34;thats not normal&#34; . ( I do see a lot of airplanes since living here 8 months and they do scare me sometimes ) I told him to go to my room and get the camera. He did so. Came back with it. Turned it on and pointed it toward the object coming toward us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strange thing, at that very moment the object ( or light ) appeared to begin going in the reverse direction. Still moving back and forth at what seems a high rate of speed. Just, in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told him to try and get the light on screen, at that moment, the video camera read &#34;hdd error&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son continued to attempt to get the camera to go into record mode.  As he did the light was moving away at what seems a very high rate of speed. Still moving left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eyes on the light, until it started to fade, then, It just went out. Like a switch was flipped. I searched for the light, could not find it anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point the camera did become active in record mode. It was useless at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The camera has never read &#34;hdd error&#34; before this that we know of. Ever. I don&#39;t even know why it would do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other problems with the camera. (Everio JVC) I know we are a strong nation, but, if we can build aircraft that moves like that, wow, what an accomplishment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time in this matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt the need to report it to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Others must have seen it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Be well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ( As a side note, I am not for nor against the theory of visits from superior beings. It is not my battle. Its what I noticed tonight is all. What sticks in my mind is the feeling I got when I did notice the light. My mind was clear, suddenly consumed, then clear again, when it was gone.) I apologize, I could not get it on camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Be well.<n>

WTF. WTF.  my wife is thinking those are very weird flying lights.  my thoughts are &amp;quot;ok, these cannot be planes because they are moving too slow and planes just don&#39;t fly like this.  must be a helicopter, i&#39;ll look for aviation lights, because by law there must be aviation lights.! no,  WTF this thing is completely glowing orange/red and it&#39;s pretty big.  meanwhile my wife is started to get upset with me because my driving is now erratic as i&#39;m being completely transfixed by what i&#39;m trying to understand.  i&#39;m searching my memory banks,  balloon?  no.  blimp?  definitely not.  chinese lantern?  no these things are big.&amp;quot;   then they are right overhead and i&#39;m leaning over the steering wheel looking up and swerving on the road and my wife is now seriously freaked out and yelling at me.  then i see the body of first one.  the edges are what&#39;s glowing orange/red  it has a diamond shaped metallic body and it looks big.  so does the other one, there are two of these.  as the first one passes and i make the mental connection that this is some type unidentified of craft,  my entire body gets goose pimples and i get them even now writing this.  i&#39;m saying holy #, holy #, holy #, this is real,  that is a real UFO.  holy #, my wife yells get on the road, ! look out!  now it&#39;s behind us and i can&#39;t afford to look backw! ards to see it or else we are definitely going to crash.  i yell to my to look at it and remember everything he sees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The witnesses were myself, my wife’s brother, my wife’s father, 2 other adults, and a teenager.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were attending the high school graduating ceremony of my wife’s nephew who was graduating from Forest Lake Academy in Apopka, Florida.  The lengthy graduation ceremony was almost finishing and I wanted to get some air and stepped outside of the auditorium.  We were located on a small hill about 300 feet north of state road 436 just west of state road 434.  Thus, the orbs were very close, about 300 feet away, and the visibility was excellent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of the witnesses began to see bright yellow orbs rising from approximately the interchange of road 436 and 434 from about tree level.  We could not see them coming from the ground but appeared to “pop out” at the tree level.  They appeared to travel in a westerly direction along road 436 just south of it.  The orbs appeared about every 1-2 minutes.   Most were uniform in direction and most went west and upwards slowly, I would guess at 10-20 mph.  Some began to float straight up and others moved faster (30-40 mph) than others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orbs then became distant and disappeared.  This lasted from approximately 9 pm to about 9:20 pm.  About 10 minutes later, two black helicopters came zooming in at a fast rate.  They stopped on top of route 436 just south of Bear Lake Road (about ½ mile from where we were).  They stayed there about 10-15 minutes and then left.  The orbs had disappeared when they arrived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Orb description:  Difficult to describe but they appeared to be the size of a small Volkswagen in the air.  They were round in shape, bright orange color.  Light was self contained in object and not emitted outwards.  I thought they might have been Chinese lanterns but I have never seen a Chinese lantern before.  But now after all of our recent sightings, I am having a second opinion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attached is a map of Forest Lake Academy and location of Orb movements.<n>

The object hovered, and then moved rapidly to the right then back to the left.  Faster than any helicopter could maneuver.  After about 1 minute the bright light completely disappeared.  After about 30 seconds it returned and continued to maneuver back and forth and up and down then rapidly moved to the south until it was no longer visible on our horizon.

The orange object flying was flying about the same speed as the plane and just about the same height as the plane. I was thinking it was a plane at first, but the plane with a blinking white light was flying right to left and the orange thing flying had no blinking light was coming sorta towards me, than passed almost in front of the plane that was going right to left. I was outside talking on cellphone and had to call back later. I got off the cellphone and tryed to film orange thing flying. I did not turn the phone camcorder on correctly and as I noticed the phone camcorder was not on I ended up turning it on this time and the orange thing flying turned black. I turned cellphone camera on correctly this time and failed to film it when the orange object turned smaller &amp; turned black as soon as I turned the cellphone camera on correctly ! this time and nothing showed up on the cellpone camcorder footage because when it turned black it would not show on the cellphone camera footage because it was too small to film and a email on cellphone camcorder interruped me when I trying to film it. Also when trying to film the settings on the cellphone camcorder has to much contrast when I was filming and maybe it should of had the cellphone camera setting set on night option, since it was just starting to get dark outside. I continue to watch it when it turned black and just disappeared as it was flying sorta over my head. The pilot flying the plane had to of seen the orange object flying and pilot flying plane with blinking light was maybe coming from Midway Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sky was clear but for a few Fluffy white clouds (Cumulus clouds) it was about 3:30 in the afternoon.  I noticed the outline of a triangular shaped object. It was transparent you could see the sky through it.  But the edges and the sky seen through the object were blurry and slightly darker then the rest of the sky.  I watched as the object Rolled to were it grew very thin were you could hardly see it and then continued to roll and was seen the same as before.  I watched as this object did this for about 1-2 mins. Then it rolled and was just gone!!  That is when I heard my daughter Say “DID YOU SEE THAT TWO!!!”  That is when I first realized she had stopped talking to and had been staring at the object to.  I am not sure how far away the object was but it was about half way from the horizon to the noon position.  So easily seen through the windshield.  The size was the same width as t! he road when you would compare the road and the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

There were no clouds in the sky and I was amazed to what I saw. it was about 3 miles away from where I was standing but I could still see the size of it like it was just a small bird flying across the street.  I was sure it was not a plane because I could still notice the wings flapping and the way it turned around.  I tried to call the other two friends but they couldn&#39;t hear me. so I went to the door to call them but as soon as they got out, we could not see it anymore because of the house blocking the view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My girlfriend and I asked a stranger to take a picture of us on top of Black Mountain in Brattleboro, VT.  It wasn&#39;t until we later inspected the photograph that we noticed something strange in one of the photos.  In total there were three photos taken in quick sequence.  In one of the photos, you can see a very bizarre anomoly above my head.  It&#39;s difficult to discern what it is, but it certainly resembles some kind of flying craft.  There were a lot of black flies up there, and my girlfriend says maybe it was a fly in front of the camera.   I think that explanation is plausible, but the UFO does not resemble a fly in any way that I can tell.  Look for yourself, here is a zoomed up picture that I swear to you, is not doctored.

As we were both looking at it a strange orange object started moving through the sky out of no where.  There were no blinking lights on the object and I was trying to convince myself that it was a helicopter but I never heard any sounds.  I don’t really know what shape the object was but if I had to give my best educated guess I would say whatever a helicopter looks like from a distance in the sky.  My friend was telling me that he thought the movement of the object was weird, sort of wobbling while flying through the sky.  I thought it was strange as well, but I can’t really explain it.  It just seemed to move unlike a completely “normal” flying object.  We watched the object move for about 15 seconds until it went behind a cloud.  It should have only been behind the cloud for maybe 2 seconds, but it never reappeared anywhere in the sk! y.  It was cloudy out that night; however, the path that the object was headed on should have been clearly visible.  I know of no object that could change its trajectory so that I would not have seen it fly out of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was silent; and did not blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 50 degrees above the horizon.  It appeared to be flying as low as many of the smaller planes from the Winder and Gwinnett airports fly.  It changed its course and travelled to the east, toward the moon. We followed it behind the tree line, but it simply disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally, we kept our eyes on the sky.  Just two minutes later, following the exact same path, was another (or the same) red light. It was silent, in the same position in the sky, and did not blink.  It headed east and disappeared right in between us and the moon, as the moon’s light is much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other small planes were seen in the sky after the sightings; all of which had blinking lights and made sound.<n>

I saw out my back windows (facing west) a large bright yellow light. It was on a path to come right over our house, so thinking it was a helicopter i got up and walked out the back door to watch it fly over. Once outside i knew it was not a helicopter because there was no noise – i yelled for my grandson and my daughter to come see what i was looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Points to note: I live in the northwest region of a major metropolitan area. There are famer  fields a short distance away (to the west the direction of what i saw) – Also i am northwest of an major international airport and during my sighting i could see a commercial plane off in the distance in the same line of sight that we were looking at. (they were landing from the west that night – flying east on approach) There was not a cloud in the sky it was a beautiful night with a beautiful full moon off to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The large yellow light seemed bigger then what a helicopter or plane light would illuminated in the beginning.( My grandson who is  5 said it was a fire in the sky).  The large yellow light then gave way to a green and red light which was decreasing in size.  Although it was still coming straight towards us, it was not a perfectly straight line that it travelled. It seemed to move from side to side ever so slightly.  The red light was getting smaller and for a few seconds the green light seemed to be a straight line of green light going through the red light. (still not any noise whatsoever).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The green light gave way to only the red light which continued to shrink in size until it was almost out of sight. At this point it changed direction not heading towards us but turned on a 90 degree angle and started heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now it get hard to explain – the small red dot now seemed to be part of a larger translucent type of oval object that if you were not looking right at you probably would not see.  The oval did not glow although it gave off the smallest shade of light – It was a different colour than the night sky, my daughter and i watched it until it went out of sight behind trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what we saw other than to say that i am a keen observer of my surroundings – &amp; i have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry very hard to explain in written text for me.<n>

Just outside our house in the sky we I noticed a glowing orange sphere of in the distance ,between the two large trees . It was traveling to the right and as it moved another orange sphere falllowed it&#39;s trail . My husband began recording the objects on his cell phone.As the objects went behind the tree he could still see the images on his phone, but not to just looking at the tree . We all the walked down to the corner of the road to see if they where still there .At this point my husband stops recording . There was only one sphere behind the tree now.  Just down Meadow St. there where two more orange spheres that seemed to be fallowing eachother headed towards Lucky Peak area ( All of the spheres seamed to be going the same route and direction)I noticed that the farthest sphere down Meadow St. was going fast . As I focused on ! it , it got smaller very quikly, then was gone .(This is when I start to get scared so memory after this point is a little off )As we continued walking down Meadow St. towards the foothills (east) there where 2-3 more orange spheres to the left of us . All in a row .Traveling East to the foothills just as the others . At this point we decide to turn around and go home.When we got home there where two spheres between the trees and we observed before we went in . They seamed to be flickering or glowing . My husband assumes they where chinease lanterns released  for  cinco de mayo ,. but my brother-in-law 5 miles away said he saw something similar in the sky that night .<n>

There was about 500” separating them from each other.  We estimated that they were approximately 1,000’ to 1,500’ high. They appeared to have pulsating  orange/red  small “wings” as if on fire . They were totally silent and seemed to be traveling 30 to 50 MPH. There was very little if any surface wind at the time.  We discussed the possibility that they were balloons of some kind, but the lack of wind and the bright, pulsating  fire-like appearance didn’t fit a balloon behavior to us.  They were at times traveling close to the full moon and I was able to get some of them on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 21:30, I pulled into the town boat launch to look at the water.  We immediately noticed 2 bright lights in the sky to the northeast.  It looked like two planes flying side by side but the lights were bright orange.  They seemed to move in tandem at about the speed you might expect a plane to fly.  Because of the strange color, we got out of the car and watch the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, a third light appeared  some distance behind the other two, also flying north to south.  The first two crossed about 1/3 of the sky line, then stopped moving in the sky, just seemed to sit there.  There was no sound.  The first two lights dimmed and went  out in a span of about 5 seconds.  Then the light in the back, which never made it as far as the first two, also dimmed and disappeared.  We could see stars throughout this event.<n>

It sat there then I called my mother who lives next door she also saw it then about an hour later.  I look back out and notice it gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However my mother could still see it from her house. It must have dropped down so much lower cause I couldnt see it since there is a big tree between my house and hers.  Then I saw a light flashing like an airplane looks but it was flying low coming toward that directions and then it goes and disappears in the tree. I see flashing like taking pictures.  Then I see nothing a couple of minutes later I see flashing more to the right then nothing.  Now I don&#39;t see anything but my mother still sees the light.

I live about 7 miles southwest of LAX.  Usually planes do not fly over me.  They usually fly around south of me around Palos Verdes because of noise ordinances.  Normally, we have, in the Southbay a heavy marine layer from the ocean, so seeing stars is a real treat when can. Last night I was cleaning my house. It was about 9pm at night.  I wasn&#39;t tired.  But, I went out on the balcony to shake out some rugs in my house. I stopped to notice the marine layer gone and how beautiful the stars were that evening. I look up towards Venus,the largest star.  There was about 4 stars around Venus.  I had my direction directly above and low and behold there was something moving. It had no lights that were very bright.  And it appeared totally black.  Against the black sky, one would have missed it if they were not looking directly at it.  It moved at a normal airplane pace but there was no noise. My line of site followed it.  If I looked away, I probably might have lost it. It! was heading northwest towards LAX. As I tried to make out this opaque plane, I could tell there were 6 dim lights on the bottom of it.  These lights followed a triangular pattern.  My gaze followed it until I could not see it anymore.  My first thought was that it was heading towards Vandenburg air force base.   We frequently get a lot of rockets and entrails around that direction.  My second thought was that it was some kind of military drone.  But, why the triangular shape? And it was silent, totally silent. Or, maybe the stealth bomber? not sure.<n>

As it crossed the face of the moon the object we could see that it&#39;s that there was a shape to the object, it turned into a black delta, (arrow head) shape object.  After it passed the moon it returned to the feature that we first saw and continued on an eastward path until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the entirety of this “UFO” fly-by no sound was heard, no visible aircraft lights were seen, and the craft seemed very high and fast as it flew a curved path from South to East in a matter of about 5 seconds.<n>

This object from underneath had a square shape with a sauce shape above the bottom portion. It was completely silent and flying very low.  I saw the object when it was dusk and it only had a very small blueish light illuminating from underneath of it.  I ran to see if anyone else was on the course playing and found four guys on hole eighteen.  They too witnessed the events, and classified it as a UFO. It was completely silent, floating above us very low, and had no lights other than a small blue light in the center bottom of the object.  It was floating very slow, and I even yelled at the object and waved to attract it&#39;s attention.  I got a very good look at this object and it was not a plane, or a weather balloon, or anything I have ever seen before.  Very scary, and very surreal!<n>

She said, &amp;quot;what&#39;s that in the sky?&amp;quot; I glanced and said &amp;quot;its just a plane.&amp;quot;  She wasn&#39;t so sure, and after only a few seconds we both knew it was no plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving too slowly to be a plane and was seemingly at a much lower altitude than a plane. It seemed to change speed, slowing down as it got closer to us.  It was quite low, hard to say exactly but perhaps only a couple thousand feet or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point the object stopped and then began receding.  It had become larger as it got closer to us, then got smaller very rapidly.  It receded to the size of a star, then smaller, then disappeared.  The impression I got from this movement was that it shot off directly into space at an extreme velocity. It didn&#39;t shoot across the sky, but seemingly outward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was reddish orange.  It&#39;s hue changed subtly over the course of the sighting.  It was orb-shaped, ovular or circular but the &amp;quot;fireball&amp;quot; description may be appropriate as well, since it glowed and seemed to give off a dim radiance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why I am convinced it was not a normal craft: -changed speed -changed direction -appeared much larger than an airplane -shaped like a ball or energy or orb (fireball) -appeared to glow with a deep red radiance, not merely reflect sunlight as some planes do around sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

An airplane enroute to BVT was flying in from SSW. As it got closer it became apparent the orange orb was far higher in elevation than I initially thought.  The plane was about 3500 ft the object was twice as high, completely silent but significantly larger than the lower airplane.  The orb seemed to fade.  The second orb appeared 15 to 20 seconds later &#34;flying&#34; on the exact same path.  This one was the same orange color, bright with a hazy shimmer above and a variegated flickering energy below.   We watched as it covered significant distance in short time.  My girlfriend suggested we get back in our car ( we had hastily pulled over on the side of the road when the first orb flew over) as the third orb appeared.  Enough time had elapsed that tha sound of the plane was gone.  There was no sound associated with this moving object.  They all flew on the same path.

I didn&#39;t want to believe it happened, but I have to get this out.  I&#39;m not sure of the exact date although the moon was almost full.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work evenings and had been home a couple hours and had just finished watching tv in the living room.  My wife and 2 daughters were all in their beds asleep.  I am a creature of habit and, correct to schedule, I turned off my tv and turned around to grab my cat to take her to bed with us.  She always watches tv with me until about 5:00AM and then I scoop her up and take her to bed with my wife and I.  My cat hangs out with me like clockwork until I take her to bed with us. (she sleeps at the foot of our bed every night.)  The lights are now off in the house and there was plenty of light coming in the living room window from the bright moon.  I turned around as usual to scoop up our big Main Coon cat and she was nowhere to be found.  I thought that was a little strange because she had been there earlier but if you know cats then you know they have a mind of their own, so I didn&#39;t think much of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I turned to go down the hall to retire to bed with my wife, I noticed how clear and bright it was outside. Since it had been cloudy and raining earlier I decided to step outside for just a moment in my socks and boxers to take in the rain-refreshed air and look at the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sidewalk had almost dried so I walked about 30 feet down the sidewalk to get to the driveway so I could have an unobstructed clear view of the night sky and nearly full moon.  I looked up and remember seeing the moon and how beautiful it looked and then something even brighter than the moon caught my left eye&#39;s per.  Vision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned an look up and at first I was amazed thinking to myself, &#34;what on earth is that?&#34;. It was a bright white glowing orb but it had spikes coming out of it all over.  The spikes were the same bright glowing white but they were not all the same size and they were constantly expanding and contracting growing larger and then smaller again.  They were pulsing and changing sizes getting longer and shorter all the time.  It&#39;s hard to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I felt frozen and terrified because it appeared very close to me - maybe only 30 or 40 feet up in the air. That&#39;s when things got really terrifying.  The reason this has stuck with me is because I was quite literally frozen in fear.  I was descending closer to me - maybe about 20 feet directly over my head now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have only two words that can explain what happened next: Primal Fear. I had always heard people being paralyzed by fear but I&#39;ve been in a lot of tense situations before and am known for staying calm and collected. if you asked me before this experience what I would have done I would have told you I would run inside. But I literally couldn&#39;t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My front door was only 30 feet away but it might as well have been 30 miles away because there was no way I could get there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember I was standing slightly off the sidewalk into the wet grass at this point and I wanted to run for the door. But I could not. I fell to the ground in a fetal position completely terrorized and paralyzed in fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no sound from the object at all. It was completely silent as it kept descending toward me now about 15 feet or so in the air. It&#39;s spikes continued to expand and contract and I began trying to scream my wife&#39;s name, tears running down my eyes. But I couldn&#39;t make a sound. I tried screaming for help but not a word or sound came out of my mouth. I remember trying to scream for my wife and then just HELP hoping somebody -anybody would hear me but I could couldn&#39;t make a sound. What I can tell you for sure is that the fear was as deep, primal and disturbing. The fear was REAL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I knew, I woke up about 11AM in my own bed naked.  But that is not unusual for me.  Sorry maybe that is a little more information than you wanted.  But it is relevant because when I woke up everything appeared normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember thinking, &#34;Oh God, it was just a dream... It was just a dream thank God!&#34; A hell of a lucid vivid dream but a dream non-the-less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, wife and kids already gone for the day, I stumbled back down the hall toward the kitchen to make some coffee.  I was starting to relax and then decided to walk outside and get the paper.  What happened next I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There next to the sidewalk where I had been standing &#34;in my dream&#34; we&#39;re my two wet socks, my damp boxer shorts (it had previously rained before the incident the night before.  My socks and boxers (the only two things I had been wearing) at the time were outside.  At that point my heart sank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I threw the socks and boxers away and have never mentioned it to anyone until now. Not even my wife.  After almost two years I still have not mentioned it to my wife or anyone else. I&#39;m afraid they would send me to a mental facility or that my wife would think I am nuts, which I am NOT.  I cannot afford to lose everything.  At best, I went sleep walking around my neighborhood naked (I am not a sleep walker). At worse, it wasn&#39;t a dream. I am very confused about it - that&#39;s all I remember.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One final thought. At night when I close my eyes and start re-living the incident over in my head to try and figure out more - when I concentrate really hard on it my body jerks and I have this extremely unpleasant electrical feeling surge through me until I stop thinking about it.  Think about what restless legs feel like but over your entire body - just for trying to remember it.  It is like my brain has blocked off my access to that memory and has set up some kind of &#34;electrical&#34; force field around it in my brain that is so uncomfortable physically that I try never to think of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So there it is. You may think I&#39;m crazy but it feels good to finally get this off my chest. By the way I own a very successful business and have a degree in business management.  I tell you that just so you know I am of at least average intelligence.  I do not drink alcohol. And I am absolutely certain I was not seeing the moon.  They were in two different places.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never heard of anything quite like this.  If you know of others similar, please let me know.  It would mean a lot to find out I am not the only one to have experienced this sort of thing. Thanks for reading.<n>

It was too consistently bright, too low, and moving way too fast to be a plane, helicopter, or falling debris.

I was facing east towards utah lake looking up in the sky. All of the sudden there were 12 to 15 bright lights flying in a V formation from south to north.  They were going very very fast; fast enough to break the sound barrier in my opinion. I didn&#39;t hear anything.  The speed they were going reminded me of shooting stars. The V formation wasn&#39;t perfect witch led me to believe that all the crafts where individual.  They were extremely bright (white) and big. like the size of holding a dime at arms length.  They didn&#39;t leave a trail or tracers &amp; they didn&#39;t change color.  It sent chills down my spine cause it was as plane as day and the most bizarre thing i have ever witnessed in my life.  The crafts were flying a few hundred feet above the mountains behind utah lake (to the east). Maybe 20 seconds after the event i looked to the south and saw an airplane flying from south to north but it was much closer to me (to! the west) Im not sure if the airplane was close enough to see it.  This is the second time in 8 months that i personally have witnessed ufo&#39;s in Utah.

The one object to the north of the other lost its illumination, while the other moved away quickly until it was no longer visible; unexplainable. They were silent.

I was driving east on FM Road 1764, a four lane with a center turn lane and narrow shouldered concrete state highway, in the right lane out of habit and right at the speed limit of 50 mph.  I knew there were approx. four or five other vehicles or so behind me by their head lights in my rear view mirrors.  This is a fairly consistently busy and traveled roadway all the way from State High way 6 in Santa Fe to Bay Street in Texas City.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As in any typical like story I was just driving along when something in the distant sky got my attention.  For a few split seconds I saw what I initially perceived to have been the typical small red marker light of an air plane of some sort, frequently seen in this part of the country.  There&#39;s quite a bit of air traffic around here as we are only about 20 - 25 miles or so to the south west of  NASA Space Center Houston, Hobby Airport Houston, USAF Ellington field Houston, George Bush International north Houston, Shoals field Galveston, and a hand full of small privately owned airports as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a matter of seconds I guess it was the fact this light I initially saw was getting much bigger because of its speed now that I think about it. In fact it is really beginning to bug me in that I can not remember verbatim the exact sequence of events but to get right to enough of what I did see is this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light began to pick up speed from a tiny red like dot in the lower part of the sky oncoming to the south east of me headed west as if it were may be originally running along parallel to the sea shore of and/ or coming in from The Gulf of Mexico out of Galveston.  Then it seemed to have hooked a sharp 90 degree turn of some sort to the north, headed in my direction but ahead of me which would have been some where around IH 45 I guess.  This was when I could clearly see that it just wasn&#39;t one light I was looking at. I could have sworn I was seeing a whole string of these things, as many as 40 plus? What ever they were began to make different formations, three abreast side by side in two coll om’s with one coll om slightly ahead of the other in multiple pairs of a distinct total of six and so on.  I even saw them shift from this to the typical triangle type image you can find on Youtube in that all you could see was the lights themselves, no structure of any kind if any att! ached to.  Then back to a single perfectly aligned long row just one after another headed back to the west. I had slowed down to 30 mph or so glancing back and forth from my rear view mirrors as I didn&#39;t want to get hit from the rear while desperately trying to watch this parade it seemed, of lights across the sky. This was when I noticed no one was passing me and could only assume they were doing the same thing in awe of these lights.  Then again, they cut to the north switching to these same type of different formations, back to the west if I recall, then as if intended just for me and the few others behind me, to the north again just in time to parade across High way 1764 a short distance ahead right in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was ahead of all east bound traffic the entire time in this area and had pulled over onto the narrow shoulder to a complete stop by this time. I was fanatically trying to find my Nikon digital camera I try to carry at all times with in reach of which turned up a little too late in the back seat of my car.  I watched these lights disappear into the  northern sky between glances back and forth looking for my camera.  One thing I do in fact distinctly remember was that when they crossed over the high way in front of me, almost directly over head as I had to look nearly straight up through the upper part of my windshield from rolling to a gradual complete stop not expecting them to turn like they did and cross the high way, I counted 7 individual lights one right after another in single file as they crossed the high way. They were a sort of a hazy orange in color at this time and about the size of an orange regarding the distance in the sky from me in which I was watching.  There was a darker solid looking orange ring around the circumference of it with no glow, tail,etc. such as a star or a comet and there was defiantly some sort of rotation going on with in. Once on the other side of the high way they went back to a staggered two column of three side by side formation with a single one by itself behind the six in front of it as if this position were some kind of safety watch for the six in front? I can also recall that when ever they did decide to maneuver one way or another in altitude or  in making a turn on a dime as they say, it would be in this single file pattern all coming together one behind the other and kind of gave me a roller coaster feeling just watching them as I saw this several times in the entire episode from start to finish. This is exactly what it reminded me of in watching a roller coaster from the ground at an amusement park when you see the first car cresting over the steepest longest drop and all the rest following behind i! t as they one by one come into view picking up lighting type s! peed in a split second free fall, and then whipping into a sudden sharp embanked turn one direction or another at the bottom of fixed tracks, only this was a roller coaster ride taking place right before my eyes in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know why I was not any more excited than usual at the time this was taking place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> May be it is because I am 57 years old now by just a few days and a total of 38 years of my adult life as a police officer in “nothing surprises me any more” in being just numb to it all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just losing my dear mother in March, family problems, just finishing an extended extra job just the day before didn&#39;t help anything either. I was tired and wore out from it all hence not being able to find my camera in time. I had awoken from about just three hours or so of no sleep in between headed in again for another eight hours. I was not in a good mood to begin with but on my way again just the same. During this ordeal I couldn&#39;t help but think, no I&#39;m not going to get on the (police) radio with this and for what as in “it&#39;s best to remain silent and just have others guessing your a fool rather than opening your mouth to confirm it” and for what even though by force of habit I found myself reaching for it. They were gone in a matter or seconds any way. I found myself in this situation the rest of the way to Galveston. I know what I saw though and better yet I know what others behind me also had to have saw. When I got to work I called the Santa Fe Police dispatcher on ! the telephone as I refuse to have a cell phone since they are now so user friendly, and reluctantly asked her has anyone with in the last 20 minutes or so called in anything out of the ordinary in the sky? She stated that I was her “second call” in regard to. This was good enough for me in that I knew I had saw something that up until then, I have only heard others report of. What I found interesting was that she could only tell me that the call came from a female however who ever she was, reported seeing more or less the  same thing only involving a total of SIX different lights. Whether my count or hers was off or not wasn&#39;t important. It was just the fact that I was assured I wasn&#39;t beginning to “see things that were not really there” and the part of human nature I guess in knowing I wasn&#39;t alone. It is now May 13, just a week and a day since I saw this event. For various reasons I haven’t been able to complete this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time by accident I caught in on part of what my youngest son was watching on The History Channel, “Ancient Alien&#39;s” a couple of days or so after the fact, newly released and very well put together I might add. I happened to see the part where Christopher Columbus reported his nearly identical sighting of unexplained lights in the sky as far back in his days which were explained as The Jewish Manor a in his words. These lights I saw were identical to the ones presented (recreated) in this program with the exception of in The Jewish Manor a there was a total of nine instead of the seven I believed to have seen and the six by the unknown to me report e to The Santa Fe Police Department. Since I wasn’t able to take any pictures this is the best example I can provide at this time as to exactly what I know I saw. The only question in my mind as in anyone else for that matter remains, just what exactly, were they?

The sounds sounded like a whistle/trumpet and varied in pitch/ volume. The length of the sound and time between sounds were consitant. There are no highways nearby and there were limited planes in the sky, but we are 100% posative it was not a plane, there are also no nearby bridges. The weather was good, it was partially cloudy and the temperature was around 65-75 degrees f.  It was also a full moon. I also observed a very bright light flash in the sky which lasted about half a second while no planes were in sight. My friends dog which was outside continuously barked into the sky as the sound was heard. after standing out side for about half an hour we went inside where the sound was still heard.  It sounded as if the sounds were constantly switching positions.  After I left my friends house   Bernardsville NJ  I went back to my own house which is located in B! asking Ridge NJ approximately 4 miles from where the sound was originally heard,  I could still hear the sounds from inside my bedroom. Also on the drive from my friends house back to mine I observed many cats and other small animals constantly running across the road which is abnormal.<n>

It was round and had bright circulating white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came to a stop at the red light, at the intersection where Don Pablo’s is located.  I was able to look up and get a really good look at this object.

The object was so high that there was no sound, however, the object remained in view for about 10 minutes once noticed.  It was traveling past the moon when we first noticed it.  It did not have an exhaust trail and it appeared to be oblong with red and gold coloring.  We checked to make sure the sun, which was behind us and setting, wasn’t the cause of the coloring, but it was not high enough to be noticeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking East up in the sky as I often do, and noticed a white object high above the lake.  For a brief second I thought it was an airplane.  When I realized that it could be a UFO, I walked out on the deck to get a better look at it.  The object was quite high up in the sky, yet it appeared to be very long.  It occured to me at that time that it was very large.  It had columns or windows from one end to the other.  There was no sound as it moved in a seemingly staight line.  I stood there watching it for about three minutes.  I know that UFO&#39;s are known to travel in groups, so I looked all around the object to see if there were any others.  That was when I noticed another one about a half mile in front of the first one.  It looked exactly like the first one.  I then focused on the first one again because it was the closest one to me.  All! of a sudden it seemed to disappear right before my eyes.  The sky at that location was clear and blue with no clouds nearby.  I then looked quickly toward the other one just as it disappeared behind a small cloud.  I waited a few minutes to see if it would reappear on the other side of the cloud, but it never did.  A few minutes later my neighbor pulled up and I proceeded to tell him what I had seen.  All of a sudden I saw another one.  My neighbor also saw it from a distance and dismissed it as a probable airplane.  I borrowed his binoculars and headed back over to the dock.  As I was trying to focus in on the object, all of a sudden all I could see through the binoculars was a white haze, so I put them down and looked up again.  This one had disappeared just as the other two had.  It was in about the same location as the first one, so again, there were no clouds nearby.  I am certain that the three objects were not airplanes, but UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time was between 12:35am and 12:40am, I know this because I had just clocked out from work, I had just turned onto main street, when I noticed a reddish orange fiery light in the top center of my windshield.  I couldn’t shake the annoying light and started to stare at it to figure out where it was coming from.  At some point driving down the road, I could view the object out the drivers’ window, it was in the dark sky and had reddish orange strings of light bowing at the top and bottom forming an oval shape.  At one point of viewing it, I could see that the oval of light had a then sliver of darkness in the middle separating the top and bottom of the oval light.  I was so intrigued I pulled off and stopped in parking lot to observe the flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, the object seemed to be hovering close enough to see well.  After a minute or two it slowly faded away, getting smaller and smaller. I got back in my car and started driving home.

Living close to a naval station I am quite aware of the types of aircraft that frequent the area.  This light however was different in that as it approached was a brilliant burnt orange and moved gracefully and silent towards my home.  As it came into view, it did not resemble aircraft of anything I am used to seeing, ie..Life flight, charter planes, 737&#39;s etc.  This light slowed and then hovered above my street, and was absolutely silent, it glowed a beautiful orange, appearing at first triangular in shape becoming  super bright then shrunk to the size of a small star in the sky turning bright white.  After a moment it resumed its original size.  It remained in a stationary position until I ran up to my front window to alert my husband who was in the house.  I was probably gone 3 seconds from where I was originally standing when I looked up and noted it had disappeared.  I quickly went for a walk thru the neighborhood and could not locate it.  I live on a bluff over looking the water and had it been a normal aircraft I could have easily caught up with it.  This one, however I could not.  In all honesty, I felt like it was merely observing, and for whatever reason I was able to see it.  It did mimic some characteristics that I observed of some other UFO&#39;s while visiting Gilliland Ranch near Mt. Adams, so I know I wasn&#39;t imagining this.  Felt quite fortunate for the experience.<n>

Began ascent on a very windy road that was steep on passenger side. Initially noticed 3 round orange lights which were about quarter size of a full moon. Did not pay much attention at first as I was keeping my eyes on the road that wound up the mountainside.  I look over again and begin thinking how odd. 2 of the lights suddenly &amp;quot;blink&amp;quot; out.  It was not dark yet and I did not see anything that could have been the source. Few seconds later, one of the lights blinked back on and only two were now visible. After about another 45- 60 seconds both lights vanished.  These lights were just off the side of the mountain.  These lights did not seem to be falling as flares would. (I have seen military flares)  They did not seem to move at all however, I was trying to navigate the windy road. I do not believe them to be airplanes. I don&#39;t know if it could have been some kind of helicopter although! ,  I saw no trace of object when lights blinked out and then back on.<n>

I was facing South and I was looking up at the bright moon to my right.  My gaze drifted to straight ahead when I saw a light out of the corner of my left eye.  I quickly turned to face it when a brilliantly bright light came out of it at me.  I am not joking. It felt and looked like as if someone held a camera inches from my eyes and set off the camera&#39;s flash directly into my eyes.  It hit more of my left eye than my right. But both are effected because it has been over an hour now and I am still seeing spots.  I did however see the object in that split few seconds before the flash.  It was rectangular shaped. Dark brassy/brown in color.  It was silent and appeared to be just floating by.  After the flash, I could no longer see the object. It was as if it just disappeared.  It startled me but I tried looking for it for a while, but it was gone.  I just hope this didn&#39;t damage my eyes.<n>

I believe that the UFO was towards the South-East sky.  I asked my wife if what I saw was a planet, and she commented that the celestial body was about 10X too large to be a planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO had the appearance of a fireball, and it looked like the surface may not be strictly stationary. Additionally, the fireball was moving about, but it stayed within the South East sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We walked in awe, watching this huge ball of flame in the sky, until we came upon a little convenience store, and approached a guy sitting outside of it, to show him as well.  He saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after this third party saw the body, it suddenly got much smaller and disappeared into the night sky.

It is orange in color and kind of strobes, sometimes slowly sometimes quick.  Each time I&#39;ve seen it I see it just still in place, then I get my camera to take long exposure shots and I was suprised the first time I saw it because my shots showed it&#39;s movement.  I photographed it until it completely dissapeared the first time.  The second time I saw it I spotted it in a completely different area, probably about 70 degrees away from the first spotting, I wasn&#39;t able to photograph it this time because I had to drive.  When I returned to the same spot about 20 minutes later it was gone.  THEN, tonight I actually saw it appear.  I was outside looking at Arcturus in the NorthEast or so and I was gazing around when all the sudden it appeared at 12&#39;oclock ahead of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediatly ran inside and grabbed my camera.  As soon as I got my camera set up it started to slowly move left.  I was able to get two 30 second exposure shots of it before it went behind trees,  It was very bright.  I grabbed my tripod/camera and ran through the field infront of my house and it just kept moving but this time away from me.  I ran across a highway and into these other fields where it pretty much shot away fast, and I then spotted it very far in the distance, I was able to get a few more shots but it was too far away and I called it quits.  Plus it was cold and Iwas only wearing pajama pants.  This thing is sure to appear again.  Hopefully I will get it again tomorrow night.

I just got into my parked car.  A large bright round amber/orange light in the sky in front and to the left of me caught my attention.  It travelled  in a  south-westerly direction at a steady speed and trajectory.  It did not look like a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t work out what it was, so I opened my car window to check for sound.  I could not detect any sound.  The object passed directly across the base of a cloud that was backlit by the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched closely to see whether there was some outline to the object apart from the light, but no other shape was observable apart from the round glowing light which was distinct and had a sort of substance to it.  I was trying to figure out how large it was, and looking around for a comparable object I saw a planet  showing large in a clear patch of sky a little behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I observed was relatively at least 2 times larger, probably mo! re.  Later calculations estimated the size of the object to be approx. 2m diameter (2min arc).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object travelled in one direction with no alterations to trajectory.  Visible for about 20 seconds before disappearing in a cloud ahead and to the right of me.

Without getting up, I dismissed him back to bed by telling him it was likely a planet. I wish I had listened to him sooner.  A few minutes later I retrieved a pair of binoculars, then my 40x Sony Handycam camcorder.  As you can see from my Youtube posts, the lights go through a long pattern of transition rotating through about seven different lighting sequences.  The object moved very slowly to the Northwest, toward Beijing.  Our home is about 100 kilometers from Beijing.  I have no idea what this flying object was.  Two airliners flew over which we could hear and see their outline.  This object had no sound and no silhouette.  With the naked eye, the bottom light looked like it was quickly changing colors from red, to green to blue, back to red, but the video doesn’t really pick up on this.  I am guessing ! it was 3,000-5,000 feet up in the air.

Event lasted from 21:30 - 22:30.  4 witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This spotting occurred in the vicinity of Randolph county, Arkansas, over the airport. The U.F.O.&#39;s luminescence was between the brightness of a regular star and that of the space station seen in the late evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted the object north of me with an airplane about the size of a small jetliner following its path east bound.  The plane followed the object back and forth repeatedly over the Pocahontas, Arkansas Municipal Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From a side view the object appeared as a gliding light.  When the object exposed its front it appeared extremely bright with multiple lights, none of which were blinking, the outer lights being slightly dimmer.  During the objects last venture eastbound it appeared to have landed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane continued to circle its last known position as the object ventured south which was the last sighting.  The plane following its path landed.  Another plane seemed to have picked up where left off but landed shortly after one circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witnes, and she seemed to us to be quite objective in her description of the object.  We suspect that she is a very good witness.  PD))<n>

It was bright like Jupiter but not so bright as Venus. It faded quickly out, slower than just instantly blinking out.  It had been stationary in the sky.<n>

I saw an orange orb, about the size a of a basketball, outside my driver&#39;s side window.  It was traveling along side my car, and pretty close, at about the height of a power line.  As I approached Happy Valley Rd. it appeared as though it would continue going south, however, as I crossed Happy Valley Rd. it took a sharp turn to the left (east) and shot down that street (where I intended to turn anyway before I had decided to follow it).  I turned around almost immediately to follow it down Happy Valley Rd.  As I turned down that street I could still see it, and it appeared to be stopped or had significantly slowed it&#39;s speed (actually, I thought it had turned back towards me at one point for a few seconds, however it was much too hard to tell). As I accelerated towards it, it also accelerated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I followed it, it changed colors from various shades of orange to red to white (although I didn&#39;t actually see i! t change, I remember that all of a sudden I noticed it was a different color, then a different color once again). With the both of us shooting straight down the road, it seemed to accelerate further and I soon began to lose it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, it banked off to the NE (across a barren, semi-mountainous landscape).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over on the gravel shoulder, grabbed my binoculars out of the glove box, and got a good view as it floated away.  Again, it was nothing but an orange orb. Given that this was directly outside Deer Valley Airport (one of the busiest private airports in the nation), there were several aircraft around (and a few other cars on the road), but no one seemed to notice but me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually I put the binoculars down, watched it move far into the distance, then decided to leave, as I had put on a good-enough chase and figured this thing didn&#39;t want to be bothered anymore. That seemed strange though; as I think back I wonder why I left at all. It was like I just decided I h! ad gotten my fill, even though it was still visible. In additi! on, when I arrived back with my family roughly an hour later, I completely forgot to tell anyone. This also seemed abnormal, as at least two members of my family, besides myself, speak candidly about this &#34;paradigm.&#34; It wasn&#39;t until I was out in the driveway with my brother and mom when I blurted it out. My mom looked at me puzzled and asked &#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&#34;  My answer, just as puzzled, &#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a note for PD and/or whom is responsible for posting these reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I entered a report earlier today (10 MAY 12) yet realized I had entered the event time as 8:20.

The time now is 14:43 pm, i saw the object at exactly 14:29 pm, i was looking at an Ethiopian Airlines plane that had just turned from taking off and i saw the object behind it!!!!  It was really really high in the sky and changed shape a few times from being circular to being elongated, when it was circular it was white,pretty easy to see, when it was elongated it was a greyish color. It was about the size of a star, it stayed as a circular shape for about 5 minutes, it seemed to move but it was so high that i couldn&#39;t see if it was moving, then it came a bit lower (it grew in size a bit) and it just zoomed off so fast and disappeared!!!!  My coordinates for where i live are Latitude = -17.8265, Longitude = 31.0632  I do not have pictures or video as it was too high, conditions were clear blue skies, no clouds in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regards<n>

We have an unobstructed view of the Wasatch Mountains from our home.  On Tuesday evening my partner called down to me to look out the kitchen window.  I turned off the kitchen light and looked out out the down stairs kitchen window.  I saw three large orange lights moving from over Big Cottonwood Canyon from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran upstairs and went into the backyard to get a better look.  My partner stood on the balcony and witnessed the same event.  I saw three and then two additional orange lights moving from the east to the west.  I yelled at my partner to grab the binoculars in the hall closet.  The objects were moving fast and I ran through the house and out into the front yard.  The objects continued to move over the house toward the west.  I ran to the neighbors house and rang their door bell.  My neighbor came outside and by that time, two minutes, the objects were gone.  My partner who had remained in the back yard said that they had turned south.  We have a stand of large pine trees on the south side of the property so I was unable to see the objects turn.  I had assumed they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were 3x larger than Venus.  They were bright orange in color and circular in shape.  They appeared to be traveling in a straight line from east to west.  I personally saw five orange objects, while my partner saw at least eight.  The entire event could not have lasted more than four minutes.  The time involved my have been even less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a few cocktails earlier before dinner but this is something that I had never seen before and I will never forget!   I called the local channel 2 (ABC) television station and asked if there had been any reports of lights over Sandy, Utah.  He said no, that I was the only person who had reported any lights.  I know what I saw and this was not a normal event!<n>

The light was going through the light color spectrum..roygbiv..repeating these colors..  The object was traveling west to east but in a non-linear fashion.   What was truley strange the object would stop by a cloud then move on to the next cloud then stop again.  Then continue until out of site..moments later one more identical object appeared then did the same thing….  It looked like they were searching for something..   My opinion:  These were living creatures…<n>

I looked up and at the height of a tall tree was a solid and black triangular aircraft.  It didn&#39;t have any wing engines like passenger planes have. It had bright white lights on the bottom lining the edge of the bottom.  The lights were big and didn&#39;t blink.  The whole object was about the length of a pickup truck and at the widest part was about as wide as it was long.  I looked away for a second to a nearby bus stop and two other people were looking up at what I was.  I don&#39;t know who they were so I can&#39;t give their contact information but they were pointing and looking up at it.  It hovered for about a minute and then banked to the right and it was gone in seconds.

They both appeared be around 30-50 feet in diameter each moving around 7 mph.  They both seemed to be synced in movement and timing. They didnt make any sound They were so close we could almost count the number of round light bulbs under the bottom of the objects as they slowly passed above our head.  The lights were bright but didnt reflect of brighten anything under it.  Each object had a circular pattern of lights directly in the center of the bottom made out of the same round light bulbs that surrounded the outside ring of both 2 objects. the center circle of lights under the bottom in the center pulsated energy in a counterclockwise motion with each bulb changing colors like a rainbow in a synchronized patt! ern repeatedly like it was feeding the outside ring which moved in the opposite direction over and over form the center ring of bulbs. The line of bulbs that came from the center circle were in a pattern like a &#34;mint candy&#34; with the curved swirly lines instead of straight lines like a bicycle rim. one ring sending colors in a circle, bulb to bulb and the outside ring being fed from the line of colorful bulbs in the other direction. 2 of them side by side, what appeared to be 5 - 10 ft apart. when 1 tilted to the right so did the other. synced! True Story.  We watched them go east towards Bishopville SC. and the whole time i had my friend phone in my hand.  To amazed to take a picture i was stuck.  Next day I left and went to vist a friend when I recieved a call from my mother telling me 2  &#34;Agents&#34; came by looking for me.
