We looked up and there was three bright flashes of blue light, then 3 rhombidodecahedron-shaped crafts flew not 100 feet overhead. they flew off, for what must of been a mile, all the while doing odd-shaped cirles, and disapeared off in the night sky. Then we found that our flashlights and watched had stopped working. We were terrified, so we called the police, but they weren&#39;t any help and just said we imagined it all. We couldn&#39;t sleep for days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  We would like reports from the other alleged witnesses.  PD))<n>

1/15/85 22:00|Sunbury|PA|Unknown|5-7 minutes|Memory of UFO sighting in Sunbury Pennsylvania during mid 80's|11/26/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33307.html|3|ndxe198501| Memory of UFO sighting in Sunbury Pennsylvania during mid 80&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date provided is by no means exact.  This incedent occured in my early teenage years which would be somewhere between 1984 and 1987.  It also occured during a cold month like december thru march.  I was with my Aunt and my brother.  We had just parked in the visitors section of the elderly highrise building on front street, which runs beside the susquhanna river.  We began walking toward the highrise when we noticed a large object (memory is to unclear to define shape) it was flying very low and moving at a unhurried pace.  It did not zoom or pause in mid air it simply continued very slowly across the sky.  I also remember that it was very silent, there were no load noises or roaring or humming sounds.  I do remember that there were a few lights( three or four in total) which were white and were on the outside perimeter, there were no lights in it&#39;s center.  The object flew directly over us.  It flew so low that we were worried for a few minutes it might hit the highrise building, which is fifteen stories high.  After it passed over the building it seemed to blend into the night sky and totally disapper.  My Aunt who is a huge skeptic of such things went right into my grandmas building and called local athorities to see if any other such sightings had been reported or if they knew of anything that was supposed to be flying in the area.  No other calls had been received and to there knowledge nothing had been noted as flying low in the area.  I know that I remember thinking that there was no way the object looked like a plane or a blimp.  It had been very low and not hard to determine that it was an object unlike anything we had ever seen.  To this day I still find myself wondering what we saw, explained or unexplained it was indeed a unique experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
1/15/85 20:50|McGrady (Wilkes County)|NC|Changing|4-6 minutes|On a clear, starry winter evening I observed a very unusual object in the night sky, my grandfather also saw the object.|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20873.html|4|ndxe198501| On a clear, starry winter evening I observed a very unusual object in the night sky, my grandfather also saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (This is an edited version of of a report that I posted on May 24, 1999). At the time of the sighting I was a senior in high school. I was visiting my grandparent&#39;s farm in a valley of the Blue Ridge mountains on a perfectly clear and moonless winter night. I arrived just before 9 pm. As I was going up the steps into the house I noticed a very large and bright object fly over the mountain ridge to the west. The object was unlike anything that I had ever seen. It was roughly the size of the full moon and nearly as bright. It gave off a steady, brilliant blue-white light (it was white in the center and became blue towards the edges). The object originally had a fuzzy, or indistinct outline. During the time I observed the object (about 5-6 minutes), it made no sound whatsoever, and it flew in a straight west-to-east line. After observing the object for a couple of minutes it flew &#34;behind&#34; a tall pine tree atop a small hill next to the farmhouse, and it was so bright that you could easily see it shining through the tree branches. Since it was dark I am not sure of the height of the object, however, it did appear to be at least several hundred feet in the air. I asked my grandfather (who was 75 at the time) to come outside, and after putting on a coat he did so. He watched the object for about a minute and commented that he had never seen anything like it - he didn&#39;t know what it was. The cold air forced him to go back inside the house, but I kept watching. About 4-5 minutes into the sighting the UFO suddenly changed both its&#39; shape and color. In a split second it went from being a very bright, circular-shaped object to a teardrop or cone shape with a dull orange color. When the object changed its&#39; shape and color it did so from the bottom up - like someone pulling up a windowshade, which I thought was very odd. The object continued on its&#39; straight west-to-east path until it passed behind the mountain ridge to the east and was out of sight. I did not see it again, nor in the years since have I seen anythin! g that r esembles it. I currently live near a busy airport, and I have seen and heard many airplanes at night, and NONE of them have borne any similarity with this object. Also, at the time of the sighting I practiced astronomy as a hobby, and I had spent many summer evenings in the back of my grandparent&#39;s home with a telescope. As a result I did have some familiarity with the night sky, and this object was far brighter and slower than any meteor I had ever seen (and this includes fireballs). The object was also much larger and brighter than any star, planet, or satellite I had ever observed. In short, I have never seen any other object which has resembled this &#34;peculiar&#34; craft. The next day I told my parents about the sighting but they laughed it off, as a result I have not told anyone until now about this object. I do remember that a few weeks later our local newspaper ran a story about some &#34;strange lights&#34; which were being seen in nearby communities, but I have never had the chance to investigate and find the article in question. I hold a master&#39;s degree and I am currently a teacher at a private high school in North Carolina.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have replaced the original report with this edited version.

All of the main highways were closed because of the storm and I was afraid I would not make it home due to the weather. I had a 60 mile drive and could not see the road and had to drive 20 mph. I pulled over to view the objects and after about 30 min. I decided to leave...I was hoping that another witness would come by but none did. I could not believe how fast I got home considering the weather but when I arrived home my wife was very upset and said I had been gone over 5 hours...I could not believe it because I thougt I made it home fast considering the driving conditions!<n>
1/15/85 01:30|Atlantic Ocean (Canada/Iceland, midway between)||Light|30 minutes|Flashing lighted object observed by an E-3A AWACS crew over the Mid-Atlantic|2/23/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12022.html|6|ndxe198501| Flashing lighted object observed by an E-3A AWACS crew over the Mid-Atlantic<n> <n><n> <n><n> Midway between Canada and Iceland at 31000 feet altitude we observed an object that was continually flashing from red to green to white.  I would have estimated the initial contact to be about 75 miles off the nose of our aircraft and at approximately the same altitude.  We were unable to pick up this object on our inflight radar...which had a range of over 500 miles.  The object stayed at off our nose for about 20 minutes before rising to what I would have guessed to be over 70000 feet in altitude.  It then came to a position almost directly over our aircraft.  It stayed in this position for about ten minutes before it took off in an easterly direction at what I would have estimated to be over 70000 feet in altitude.  I was the pilot on that particular flight.  At the time, I had over 3000 hours of flight-time, mostly in jet aircraft.  There were 17 other people on the aircraft who witnessed the same object.  I did not learn of your reporting facility until I started listening to Art Bell.  I&#39;m sorry my report could not have been more timely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NUFORC NOTE : Subsequent email to witness :<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear &lt;&lt;Name Deleted&gt;&gt;,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the fascinating report!  The olde reports I find to be every bit as interesting as the more recent ones.  The reports from professional pilots are particularly interesting, and useful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks again for sharing the information with our Center!  Please pass our contact information along to other pilots, so that they will be able to preserve the information surrounding any sightings they may have had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NUFORC NOTE : Subsequent reponse from witness<n> <n><n> <n><n> The type of aircraft I was flying was an E-3A AWACS aircraft.  This was a military aircraft with airborne radar and surveillance capabilities.  It has a crew of 17, all of whom witnessed the same object.  We should have been able to pick the object up on our in-flight radar which was fully functional at the time we saw the object. In reference to your second question, we tried to make a report when we landed in Iceland, but noone in our debriefing knew how or whom to report such an incident. I hope this info helps.  I find your reports on the Art Bell show very fascinating.  I wish I knew about his show 15 years ago.  Take care now.<n>

He manned the main tug.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night, very late, they witnessed a very large explosion miles away - sufficiently powerful to fully illuminate the barge they were towing which was a city block behind them so that it was completely lit.  He cut loose his lead tug and went to investigate, expecting to find debris.  He found nothing.  He then commented how he several times has seen sizable glowing orbs moving beneath his ships under the water in formation in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was immediately followed by another partyer who recalled camping with his dad and brother in a state park in NY state, one that had restricted air.  They were out ((deleted)) under the stars, when they noticed a large glowing object floating above the nearby trees.  It took off, immediately to be chased by 3 US military aircraft - again, all in a no-fly zone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

1/1/85 21:00|Largo|FL|Other|5 minutes|Very large UFO, irregular in shape,  glowing red-orange craters, below cloud level, no noise,  reported in paper as space debris.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42261.html|9|ndxe198501| Very large UFO, irregular in shape,  glowing red-orange craters, below cloud level, no noise,  reported in paper as space debris.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize that this is a very old sighting, but felt that it was too significant to not share with others, and see if there are any other reports of it on record.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was approximately 15 years old when I saw this UFO.  It was approximately 9:00 PM.  It was a moonlit night, and there were many cumulus clouds in the sky that were bright white from the moonlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outside my house with 4 of my neighbor friends when I noticed a very large object slowly drifting across the sky.  All of us saw it.  The object was extremely large; much larger than a blimp.  I would estimate the size to be at least 100 yards in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I could not tell the altitude of the object but then realized that it was very close because it blocked out the clouds as it silently drifted over us.  I listened carefully for an engine noise, but there was none audible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was irregularly shaped.  The best way I can describe it was that it looked like a large rock; appearing at least 4 times larger in diameter than it was in height.  The object was rough and had many craters (resembling the texture of asteroids I&#39;ve seen photos of).  The craters emitted a dull glowing red-orange light.  I could not actually see the source of this light, the light instead seemed to be reflecting off the craters of the object from a source within it.  The object did not vary in speed, direction, or altitude.  The object was visible for at least 5 minutes before it finally drifted out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the sighting I knocked (no banged) on several neighbors doors to have them also witness what my friends and I were seeing in the sky.  When the neighbors would come outside to find out what was going on they were awestruck with what they saw in the sky.  It was no doubt to any of us that what we saw was not of this world, and was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I looked in the St. Petersburg Times Newspaper for information about what we saw the previous night.  I was sure that many hundreds of people must have seen the same thing we saw in the sky.  I thought that surely it was reported by many people.  I finally found a very small article in the back of the paper that said (to paraphrase)  &#34;There were numerous reports of an unidentified object in the sky last night.  There is no need to be alarmed, it has been confirmed that this was only space debris&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Space Debris!!!&#34; I thought...... Well this was no space debris.  I am sure that the object was within our atmosphere because it blocked out the clouds as it drifted overhead.  The object had no wings.  It had no engine or propulsion device that I could see nor hear.  This object should have fallen to the ground if it were space debris, but instead it defied gravity and drifted across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure that this sighting must have been reported to UFO reasearchers by others that also witnessed it.  I did not save a copy of the article that I read so recently I attempted to search the database of the St. Petersburg Times to find an archive of this article but the database online does not go back that far.  I am hoping that there is eveidence on file of this sighting.  Could you please tell me if you have any record of this.  As I mentioned this was a very large UFO and plainly visible in the evening at approximately 21:00 hours.  The Date is just an estimate as I was a teenager at the time and guess that I was approximately 15 years of age.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.
