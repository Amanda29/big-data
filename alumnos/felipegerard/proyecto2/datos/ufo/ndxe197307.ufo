7/31/73 18:20|Burlington|NC|Disk|5 minutes|Huge, clearly- defined saucer hovers at treetops|7/26/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23631.html|1|ndxe197307| Huge, clearly- defined saucer hovers at treetops<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a teenager &amp; watching TV when I heard what sounded like a huge vacuum cleaner ououtside. I went out &amp; saw a huge saucer -about the size of a football field- hovering just above the woods. We lived in the county about 3 miles from the small airport. The UFO was huge, made a humming, vacuum sound, domed on top &amp; bottom with rotating lights around both domes &amp; around the middle, except the lights around the middle didn&#39;t rotate but seemed to flash randomly. I felt no fear, just awe. I ran into the house &amp; got my mother so she could see it &amp; she did. Being mechanically-minded I focused on the sound of the craft to try to determine its power source &amp; was very conscious to pay attention to details of appearance. I took a Polaroid picture after getting my mother but it didn&#39;t take. The photo background was brownish-black with 3 scarlet red smears in the center. I don&#39;t know what happened to the photo but now think the red smears were heat indicators. I&#39;ve drawn this craft several times over the years &amp; keep one with me in case I run into someone who claims to have seen the same thing. I was intelligent &amp; didn&#39;t use drugs. I saw this craft, I am not crazy, &amp; I have been trying to figure out its power source for 29 years. I am a technical mechanical engineer by trade &amp; now have a pretty good idea about the craft&#39;s power source. I believe there&#39;s a reason some of us see these things &amp; some don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know what that reason is but I know that my life changed when I saw that UFO &amp; feel there was a purpose for it. Maybe submitting this report is the reason. If anyone from this area also saw this, please submit your report. I reported this sighting to the airport nearby &amp; the sheriff&#39;s department immediately after my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate.  PD))<n>

There were 4 witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw 2 lights flying together and noticed erratic flying patterns. Got in car and chased objects for 20 minutes before losing them. A minute or two later one of the objects approached from the west and flew directly over our car which was pulled over to the side of the road. There was no noise at all. This was about 9:00 PM. The object then came to a complete stop about 200-300 yards east of us and started to descend. It hovered for a few minutes maybe only 500-1000 feet altitude. It then ascended and flew off. We could not chase it anymore since there were no roads east of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had many more sighting between 1973-1976 in the Milwaukee area. The objects always had a bright white light in front of the craft and a red and green light behind it. Lights would never pulsate and there were no stobe lights. They never made any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was out on my deck with my wife eating breakfast and I saw something in the sky. I saw a cigar shaped object moving slowly across the sky. It had bright lights, like windows along the side of it. Then in the next five minutes, three more craft appeared. They were in a V-shaped flight formation heading to the north.  My son came on the deck with me and my wife four minutes after the other three appeared. After a short time, maybe a couple minutes, the craft took off at very high speed to the north.  I never saw them again.<n>
7/24/73 02:24|Blackfoot|ID|Triangle|Approx. 4 minutes|Smooth, rounded triangular object, stone grey, no lights or markings, dome on bottom, silent.|3/7/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02075.html|4|ndxe197307| Summary : Smooth, rounded triangular object, stone grey, no lights or markings, dome on bottom, silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was &#39;camping&#39; in the backyard of my friend of the time in the Blackfoot Idaho of 1973.My friend told me there was a UFO in the sky, come look. I figured he was lying. He became deathly serious, and told me that if I did not look, I would regret it forever. His tone scared me, so I looked.Up in the 3 am sky was a smoothly moving object. It was the size of my right thumbnail on my outstretched hand.The object was perfectly silent, a rounded, smoothly contoured equal edged triangle. It appeared to have either a dome shaped hollow or protrusion in the middle bottom. There were no lights, seams, markings, or details whatsoever.It appeared as though cast of one solid piece of material. It was the grey of stone, and was visible by virtue of the reflected glow of city streetlights upon it. It moved in a perfectly straight line, with no &#39;point&#39; of the triangle facing the direction of travel exactly. Near the zenith of our view, it suddenly altered direction without curving or slowing down.One second it was going one way, the next instant it was moving about 35 degrees or so another way. It contined on this slow, smoothand straight new path, until it was lost to sight behind trucks parked near us. I saw the object go past telephon and power lines, it was above and behind them.My friend and I decided not to speak about it, but instead to immediately go inside the house, and seperately draw and describe the event on paper, then exchange the papers.We though this would let us know that what we saw was &#39;real&#39;. Our reports to each other, when finished, were identical, except for one difference.I had thought the dome on the bottom was a &#39;hollow&#39;, not unlike the &#39;dimple&#39; in red blood cells, while he thought the dome protruded outwards from the rounded shape. I ascribe this to the difficulty of percieving an unfamiliar contoured shape in reflected light from distance.The event lasted approximately 4 minutes in total, from the time I started looking, to the time the object glided silently beyond our vision.During the event I measured the object with my thumb, and closed my eyes briefely to see if it would still be there when I opened them, it was.The sky was perfectly clear, and the stars shone brightly. Our shared yard was surrounded on all sides by large trucks, houses, a fence, and trees, making for a perfect viewing environment,with no directly visible light sources to spoil our view. I was 13 years old at the time, my friend was 14.I have never forgotten this sight. It was utterly unique. I have no feeling or impression whatsoever about what the object actually was. It could have been anything from ship to lifeform to paradimentionalprotrusion to shared, perfect hallucination. Any of these explanations are equally fantastic. It simply...was. Featureless, solid, grey, and oblivious tothe way objects are supposed to move.I have not seen anything else, since. I have certainly seen nothing else like it.It taught me a few things: one, that during a genuine sighting it is utterly impossible to hope to realistically describe thesize of a UFO, as there is no yardstick by which to measure it, save one&#39;s own arm, or a nearby object. Against the starry sky,such a thing could have been any size (within reason) and almost any distance away. There is litterally no way to tell.Therefore I discount the tales of folks who claim to know the distance and size of an utterly unfamiliar object.Lastly, I feel a little cheated. In the years that followed this event, I have heard many tales of UFO sightings, all with fancy lights,weird sounds, strange feelings, and so forth. My sighting was not so spectacular, just a blank, seamless impossibility,moving silently. It did at least move in an impossible manner, which is at least something!I cannot remember my friends name after all these years, alas. I hope that this report may cause him to contact me,so that I can reminisce about this event.<n>

The apparent size of the aura at that distance was about an inch across.  The light moved from the south extreme horizon to the north extreme horizon within five seconds.  It then reversed direction and moved south to the extreme horizon at the same speed.  It then re-centered and vanished.  There was no sound.<n>

We stopped at a roadside cafe in Warm Springs, Oregon for breakfast, about 9 am.  Shortly after seating, my brother  noticed a metallic, disk-shaped craft hovering approximately 200 yards away and about 75 to 100 yards above the ground.  A green beam of light shone down to the ground.  The sighting lasted for about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  I was watching the waitress as she went to alert other customers of the craft, when it vanished, along with everyones&#39; memory of it except mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that day the craft was following us along highway 97, keeping itself partially hidden within the tree-line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our trip home, which religiously took 12 hours, took 13.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the only one in my family with any memories of these incidents.

We were going to have pizza. Ahead of us the houses thin out and there was a section of about two city blocks where there were no houses, just grass lots. Beyond that was a small unused strip mall,some fast food and other types of stores. Beyond that was Interstate 57. As we talked we noticed a string of red lights appear above the dark strip mall. We could make out a form that was darker than the night sky.  To me seemed round with the lights ringing the middle. I would say it was about 30-40 feet across.The object started to move very slowly to the north west. I remember we talked about what it could be, One of my cousins said it must be a helicopter to move so slowly and hover like that. About that time the lights went out. a few moments later a small private airplane crossed the sky to the south east. We could plainly hear its motor. That ruled out a helicopter. The object could still be made out as a dark spot in the sky. It moved west until it reached the interstate highway at which it moved lower and went north along the highway. We could plainly see the traffic moving under it. It went north along roadway until just about the exit/overpass at which time it tilted skyward and in a blur was gone. We were shocked and at this point we knew it was nothing we could point a finger at and say &#34;that was it&#34; We talked excitedly and ran to the pizza place. We had been there maybe three minutes. Standing in line to place our order when a man in his early 20&#39;s came running in. He was hysterical. He asked where the phone was, he had just chased a UFO on the interstate. People in line snickered and we stopped talking about it until we were seated. Obviously he had seen the same thing we had.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

7/17/73 21:00|Asheville|NC|Disk|4 minutes|late at nite, huge object, hovered about 50 ft. above ground. saw windows on the bottom. with orange glow eminating from windows .|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13230.html|11|ndxe197307| late at nite, huge object, hovered about 50 ft. above ground. saw windows on the bottom. with orange glow eminating from windows .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Experienced by my co-worker, Steve. It happened, he went for a drive with his wife and 7 yr. old daughter. They drove near a car-wash on , I guess a back street.. Steve said he saw thiss thing floating about 50 feet up in the air. He stopped his car beneath this thing.Steve got out under this thing. He describes it as follows. It was a very very dark nite. As I drove by the car wash, I could see this thing, about 50 feet in the air. It was making no noise. at first, I only law a circle about 25 feet in diameter. at approximately a 90 degree angle from the bottom of the circle, I could windows, with and orange amber glow coming from them.The windows connected to the bottom of this huge thing, that was as big as a football field..I listened for a sound and heard nothing, but was completely AWE STRUCK . I saw, what looked like scorch marks on the bottom where the windows connected to the bottom to this huge ship.. My wife screamed out to me, Steve, get back in the car.I came back to my senses. Unbelievablelythis object, moved slowly at first, , then ziiiiiiippppp, it moved about 2 miles in a couple of seconds. It stopped right above a small mountain and zipped, very fast over them, about 5 miles away towards some other mountains, paused and moved out of site. My friend Steve, a co-worked told me this. He and his wife is now divorvced and he has remarried. His new wife did&#39;nt believe him. He went thru a nasty divorce, but to this day, his ex backs him up with this story. Steve can really tell u the details better than I can.<n>

I was 5 years old, and my parents ran a County Home for foster children awaiting placement in homes.  My family lived in an apartment connected to the facility.  I walked out of the front door of the facility and stood on the porch.  Above me was a circular craft with lights (green, red, yellow, blue, white) circling the circumference of the vehicle.  It was not a helicopter, as the lights moved slowly around the edge.  The only noise was a low, almost muffled, humming sound from the craft.  It held its position relative to me steady, with very little side to side movement.  I was young at the time, but my memory seems to be that the craft was approximately 45 to 55 feet in diameter, hovering approximately 100 to 200 feet in the air.  I ran back inside the building and called to my father to come look at the craft, and when he and I walked back out approximately 2 to 3 minutes later, the craft was gone.  My wife and my parents are the only people who have heard that story, until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was probably around June to August.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10pm one summer night when 6 or 7 girls came busting into my room running to the window.  They were very upset, talking about a space ship but I was laying in bed, reluctant to believe them.  When I got to the window.  I saw a grey looking oval shaped object.  From my view, we were looking underneath the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were square like boxes underneath that white lights were passing over.  We were on the 9th floor and I could see many girls in their windows looking at the ship and screaming and hollering.  The object just hoovered there for what seemed like eternity and then just moved quickly out of view. There was no sound from the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so hysterical the director of Job Corps called a meeting in the middle of the night to calm us down.  There were 400 women in that building that night and at least 250 witnessed this ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was not a blimp or airplane. Picture in your archive August, 1973; 9:00 PM.Princeton,Indiana (USA)looks like the bottom except there was boxes of lights rotating underneath and I couldn&#39;t see what the top looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Except for family, I have never discussed this because it is so scary to remember.  When I saw the picture in your archive I couldn&#39;t stop shaking and decided to share my long held secret.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be interested in talking to other Job Corpsmen that were there that night to see how they cope with this memory. It still scares me today, 32 years later.<n>

Mainly because nobody beleived me who didn&#39;t witness this event.  I was working the &#34;B&#34; shift at The Eastman Kodak company at the time. As many of us were going to lunch, we walked to the ajacent building to the employee cafeteria. On our way over, we notice a guy looking up over towards downtown Rochester and pointing to an object in the sky. We were looking in a Easterly direction. There, about a mile or so away, about 2000 feet up was this sphere shaped object just hovering there. It wasn&#39;t possible to see any distinct color except for the changing color lights. It would change from green to red to amber. Sounds like a traffic light, but seriously, this thing was seen by scores of people. As others passed by, we pointed it out only to be teased and mocked. There were about 4 or 5 of us who stood there for at least 20 minutes and watched this out of pure facanation. The sky was clear and before sunset. All this object did was hover and didn&#39;t move at all. There were no other aircraft in the area. A short time later, the other employees were  returning from their lunch. Some looked at it and scoffed,&#34; Aw, thats just a balloon&#34; and some other cheeseie explanations and continued back to work. At that point, I myself had to return to work because lunch was over. Needless to say, I never got my lunch, I was too facanated with what we were witnessing. When I got home, I called the local planetarium to see if they saw anything. They saw nothing. I KNOW what I saw along with 4 or 5 other people. Not to mention the many other skeptics. I looked up as I was walking up to my building and it was simply vanished. The others saw this too. When I tried to tell others about it, they all just laughed and because of this I never spoke of it again.<n>

We were on old Winston Rd. when my uncle slowed the car down,  this got my attention.  There were several cars in front of ours that was also stopped.  Directly in front of us and located above the trees was this hugh UFO.  It was metal in color.  It had round windows all around the craft with light coming out of it, several colors. It was silent.  It defied physics in that it stayed perfectly still, as it set in the air just above the trees, centered over the two lane road we were on.  In moments, it lifted up and dissapeared from our eyes in phenominal speed, again, no noise.  The traffic then began to move on out.<n>

I was on my way to bring my girlfriend home and when we got to her house, her neighbor was outside in the middle of her field looking at the sky.  We asked her what she was doing that late and she said a light was hovering over her horse stables, and the horses were spooked and ran out.  She caught a bit of it and it stood there hovering for a few moments and then shot off.  It was something odd, and I know that I saw a UFO.  I don&#39;t khow if anyone else has seen this in our hometown at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My husband&#39;s grandmother (now deceased) called and asked to speak to Stanley. She said she wanted him to go outside and look at the UFO she had been watching that looked like it was close to our area. After talking to her we went outside and looked to our west. There was a huge, building size, silver, saucer shaped object with what looked like an upside down cereal bowl on top of it hovering in the sky about a mile from our house.  We had been outside just a few minutes when my brother-in-law, Jim (now deceased)and my sister-in-law, Georgia, screeched their car into our driveway to ask us if we had seen &#34;it&#34;.  We all looked at it for a few minutes and then Stanley and Jim decided to ride down the road and see if they could get close enough to tell anything about it. Georgia and I just sat there and watched it. It didn&#39;t move at all. it just appeared to be sitting over a radio tower. When Stanley and Jim came back to the house about 30 minutes later they told us that they stopped at the entrance to the dirt road leading to the radio tower because they were afraid if they went closer they might get picked up and taken on a ride they didn&#39;t want to take. We got the radio and tried to listen to the news and see if anyone else was reporting this or watching it. We finally found an announcer on KBZB radio station that was talking about all the static they were having on their radio transmission and how they were sending a trechnician out to the tower that was having trouble to see what as wrong. Stanley called the station and was asking where their tower was. The disc jockey was talking to him on the air and we could hear the whole conversation on the air while we were outside still watching the saucer. The disc jockey confirmed it was their tower where the saucer was. Stanley hung up and came back outside to watch. Almost an hour after we started watching it the saucer began to move toward the North. It made a turn that was a 90 degree angle and slowly moved off until it was gone. No flashing speed, just slowly drifting away.  The radio station had stopped broadcasting anything about it so Stanley called the disc jockey back and asked him why did they stop telling about it, what happened? The disc jockey told him that their  technician got to the tower and when he saw the size of the saucer over the tower he went into shock and left. He said they had to take him to the emergency room and get him medicated to calm him down. The disc jockey also told Stanley that he had been contacted by someone claiming to be with the federal government who told him if he didn&#39;t want the radio station to lose it&#39;s license and be shut down he better quit talking about what happened. He said he was told &#34;Just be Quiet about it&#34;.  But we were all there, and saw it happen before sundown on a bright, summer night. I had never seen anything like it, and don&#39;t know what it was for sure, but I know it was really there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

The color was stainless steel.  It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sent a report about the ufo in Odessa yesterday Sept. 12.  You sent an email back saying you want detailed information.  I said I was a slow typer, so my little sister said she would type the complete event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had worked real hard that day for the state highway dept. and I was tired, so I took a nap when I got home.  This was a clear summer day, and all the events occurred in the daylight.  My grandmother lived in the southwest part of the city of Odessa.  As I was taking a nap, she called my wife.  She said, have Stanley go out and look, because there is a ufo heading your way.  I lived west of town out in the country.  There weren&#39;t many houses out there at that time.  When I awoke, I sat and thought about it a minute, and thought my grandmother is very serious.  She doesn&#39;t tease.  I decided to get up and go outside and look for the ufo.  First I looked toward town and saw nothing, which would have been back toward the east.  Then I turned and looked toward the north and south and saw nothing.  When I turned and looked toward the west, there it was.  Above the radio tower, about 1 mile from my house.  My wife and I got very excited, because we knew it was probably an alien ship.  It made no sound.  About this time, my brother in law and big sister who lived about 2 streets over came flying around the corner in their car.  They were hollering out of their window as they approached, saying &#34;do you see it, do you see it?&#34;.  When they got out of their car, of course all four of us were excited, and I don&#39;t remember what we said at the moment.  We had no camera and they had no camera, and I ran to the neighbors house to borrow a camera and they weren&#39;t home.  Then as we watched it, we were all amazed and I said, wait a minute, I think that&#39;s a radio tower!  So I went to my car, I turned the radio on and started scanning all of the channels.  Then in our amazement, we came across a station, and my wife said it was KBZB, to the best of her memory.  But of course you have to realize this was about 32 years ago.  We were really shocked when we heard the disc jockey saying that they had a ufo above their radio tower causing static.  So we kept listening to his reports and watching the ufo, and I decided to go inside and look up the phone number of that radio station.  I did get the disc jockey, and I don&#39;t remember his name.  I did ask him if his radio tower was out on west university and he said, yes that&#39;s our radio tower.  I said, we&#39;re looking at the ufo that you&#39;re talking about.  I don&#39;t remember what else I said at the momet, but in a little while I hung up and went back outside with everybody else.  Already the ufo had been over the tower about 20 to 25 minutes.  My brother and law and I started having the discussion of driving to the ufo, which was about 1 mile from my house.  So we tried getting to the tower by going down different dirt roads and couldn&#39;t reach it from that direction.  So we drove to the main highway, which is west University and found a road which led to a little road which goes to the radio tower.  Whether or not the ufo would have interefered with the elctric system of the car, I do not know because we killed the car and stopped at the beginning of the little road that led to the ufo.  We were probably about a half mile, maybe a little farther, from the ufo.  The color of the ufo was a stainless steel.  My brother in law and I sat there and started having the discussion of whether or not to drive up to the ufo, which we could have done.  We actually decided not to drive under the ufo, because we thought we might get a flight we did not want.  I don&#39;t recall what we said during the time we sat there but gradually the ufo moved from the radio tower to the north, it made a 90 degree turn and drifted off toward the west, out of sight.  We drove back to my house and they were no longer reporting the ufo on the radio station.  I called the radio station again and got the same disc jockey and said, why did you stop reporting about the ufo, and he said that the government told them to shut it down or lose their license.  He said, I will tell you something else though.  Our electrician went out there to check on why we were having static, and when he got back he was so excited and disturbed that we had to take him to the hospital to get him a hypo to calm him down.  He said there were hyroglyphics on the bottom of the ufo.  So I hung up after that discussion and later on I called him back one more time and he said one of the t.v. stations had pictures of a ufo above the street lights on west university at night and the government confiscated their pictures and told them to be quite or lose their license.  He said that he didn&#39;t want to talk about it anymore, because he was afraid he would get in trouble.  This completes my version the best I remember of this event, and it is the truth.  There were five witness, and I have thier names and occupations on the original report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

Nothing goes that fast - stops ON A DIME - then maneuvers intentionally 3 times and hoves each time - the goes from 0 to whatever on its way.  Nothing strikes our atmosphere and bounces around in a methodial path with intentional pauses....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

7/5/73 20:00|Stockton (intersection of I-5 and I-580)|CA|Changing|3hrs|Witnessed numerous UFO's along I-5 from Stockton south to Tehachipi on busy holiday weekend.|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61253.html|28|ndxe197307| Witnessed numerous UFO&#39;s along I-5 from Stockton south to Tehachipi on busy holiday weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event took place in 1973. I was 21 years old and traveled from San Diego County to Portland Ore with my brother and his wife on 4th of July weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother was in army aviation at the time and I was a student pilot.  Another brother was an air controller for the SAC, a close cousin an army pilot and his brother an Air Force kicker.  We grew up adjacent to air bases: Kirkland, Biggs, Mira Mar and Camp Pendleton. We are very familiar with aircraft and their abilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the return trip from Portland we were at the cloverleaf of I-5 and I-580 in the Stockton California area at dusk. (perhaps 8PM). The freeways were very busy. My brother and I saw a craft coming from our 10 o&#39;clock position very low. Our first assumption was that it was a crop duster as they are common in that vicinity and they prefer to work right up to sunset. The craft had three lights, red, green and amber, not unlike any aircraft except that they were in the wrong positions and the anti-collision lamp did not blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft came in right over our windshield at about 60 -100 ft AGL!  We looked directly up at it but only saw a blur. It appeared to be transparent. It past over us to our 2 o&#39;clock position and only about 300 ft lateral and 100 ft altitude. I got a good look at it. It was tubular with a simple frame for a fuselage. The craft was transparent as if made from see through covering. It had short stubs protruding from its sides that were not sufficient to be wings or airfoils. It had no engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It immediately, without turning, returned in our direction while descending.  An impossible maneuver for any aircraft that I know of. It&#39;s speed was slow, perhaps 45mph. The stubs turned out to have bright lamps attached and they were activated nearly blinding us. The craft flew down to the deck illuminating the field of wheat (or rice) and pushing it aside as it moved a few feet above it. I again got a close look and the craft was not a duster or helicopter. I have never known dusters to use lights as dusting is too dangerous at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked at other motorists at they seemed not to notice. We followed the progress of the crafts as it continued to crisscrossed I-5 in a similar fashion as we moved south at about 80 mph. Complete darkness fell swiftly. We then saw many craft with two lights performing the same maneuvers amongst the fields. They were acting as if they were looking for something on the ground by &#34;strafing&#34; it with their lights which were too close together to be mistaken as autos in the distance. We also noticed that at times they would stop and hover over the California Aqueduct and shine their beams downward. We stopped several times to witness the events. Though many times the hovering objects were close they made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again other motorists seemed to notice nothing. There were usually three in sight at all times. We tried to rationalize that it was helicopters, agricultural machinery or autos in the distance. However, in the following years i made that same trip many times at night and never saw anything like it again. Our only rational thought was that it was police looking for someone. We listened to the radio in ernest hoping for a news announcement. Of course there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object(s) began following us at fence top level along the opposite side of the freeway, about 100 yards behind. We tested them several times by speeding up to 140 mph and then slowing to about 20mph. The craft(s) kept pace with us! When they seemed to be bored with this game they would fly off laterally at high speed but still stay within sight. Often they would be replaced by another in their former position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the initial first sighting near Stockton, my sister-in-law fell asleep in the back seat. We attempted several times over the next few hours to awake her to witness the show but were unable to. She was clearly alive but slapping and shaking could not wake her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were totally confused and decided to stop in at a truck stop a few miles off the freeway near the bottom of the Grapevine. We had witnessed this phenomenon for about three hours at this point. We made casual inquiries in the restaurant of the staff and truckers but no one saw anything. My sister-in-law remained unconscious. We continued on our trip south and had no more sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon awaking the next day my brother and I went over what had transpired. We discovered that we were missing somewhere between 90 and 180 minutes of time. We checked our gas receipts which were dated and time stamped and new our speed averaged 80 mph except for the few times we stopped which we accounted for. We had no sensation that we were abducted then or since and suffered no ill effects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many years later I read a book by a UFO investigator that stated that 1973 was a big &#34;flap&#34; year in California and the Central Valley in general.<n>

My husband had died 4 months before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the 4th of July, 1973.  The young boys wanted to sleep so I slept out with them on the front lawn of our country home.  We had fun looking at the stars and we were tired.  The boys fell asleep but I couldn’t, because I was thinking of their Dad and wishing he was here with us.  I did things like this with them hoping it would help them to not be so sad.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I lay there I looked up and saw a large &#34;fireball&#34; floating over the trees and continued over the house, coming from south to north.  After it passed over another one came from the same direction but slightly off the same path but also going in the same direction.  And as soon as it passed was over my shoulder I saw a 3rd one came over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their color was orangy-red and looked on fire and they were complete silent.  No noise at all..  It took about 10 seconds for each one of them to pass overhead until the next one came.  I was so shocked that I didn’t turn around to see how long it took them to go out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I tried to compare their size with the moon.  Comparing the almost full moon in the sky to the fireballs they were three-fourths as big as the moon.  It’s really hard to tell how high or low they were.  I’d say they were as big as a saucer held at arm’s length.  This probably doesn’t make much sense but it’s the best I can do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went to work the next day I told co-workers about it and they said it was being announced over the radio if anyone saw something strange in the sky last night to report it to the Sheriff’s office.  I did report it and sent the diagram I had made right after it had happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My only purpose in reporting this now is just to let someone, somewhere know that UFO’s are REAL because I saw it &#34;with my own eyes.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m a Christian woman and would not lie about what I’ve seen.  I’ve recorded it in my personal history of my life and I’ll never forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for giving me the opportunity to report this incredible sighting.<n>

Disc came from the west coverd in moss for camoflage it stoped to hover almoast over head speeking message tellapathicly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was early on A summer day, 1973. I was five years old. I was siting on A red swing, I remember looking out to the west at the tops of the trees at what I thought must be an airplane. As it grew larger the closer it came, I reolised it was not an airplane. It was A disc A ufo coverd in moss slowly aproaching me hovering maby 30 feet over my head as it stoped almost directly over me. My reaction was total amaizment then fear. The disc was and looked man made. A dark metallic color, it had rivets around it&#39;s seems and was coverd in green moss. It had window port holes around the craft and measured about 15 feet from end to end. It looked exactly like the metal used to make ww2 airplanes compleet with rivets around its edges and port  holes. It made A noise, A low, wumm wumming sound like some engine making A revolution. Then it spoke to me in my head, it said do not be afraid we&#39;r from the government. Don&#39;t try to move you&#39;r parolized, don&#39;t tell you&#39;r mom or dad cause they&#39;ll think you&#39;r crazy. Then the noise increeced, the rotation sound going from low to high piched and then it started moving slowly at first then increecing its speed untill it was gone into A line of white light.<n>

We knew from the shape and movement that this was something really different.  As it moved out of our eyesight a motorcycle was heading towards us (we still were walking west)the motorcycle stopped and the rider asked if we had seen what he also witnessed.

Huachuca, AZ, in July, 1973. My friend, Ed Knees and I were going northbound toward Huachuca City (where we both lived off base), at approximately 22:30 hours, when I noticed a golden light pacing us. I mentioned this to Ed, who said it was probably the moon reflecting on electrical or telephone wires. After I pointed out that the wires were on his side, he stopped the van. We both observed the light, which was stationary at this time, until Ed used the spotlight mounted to the top of his van (used for hunting at night). Right after Ed flashed the light at the “ufo”, it completely vanished. The really unusual thing was, it made absolutely NO sound whatsoever. This base also had rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and I am very familiar with the current US governmental inventory. This occurrence took approximately 10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second sighting: July, 1985 - I was sitting in a hot tub with 2 other friends, at approximately 21:00 hours, when we all noticed a oval craft, going over our heads. This craft had green, blue and white lights going in a counter-clockwise circle, around the craft. We were just 2 miles from the Concord Naval Weapons Station (carried nukes) in a town called Antioch, California, and the craft made absolutely NO noise -–not even a whisper. Again, I am familiar with most fixed wing and rotor aircraft, and this did not fit that inventory! This incident took approximately 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Third sighting: August, 1985, same location (Antioch, California).  At approximately 02:00 hours, I got up from watching the TV, to get a drink at the kitchen sink. I happened to look up to see a very large, dark gray triangular object apparently floating in the air, approximately 5000 feet altitude. It had red glowing lights on each point, and a softly glowing white light in the center. This craft also made no noise at all. After 2 or 3 minutes, it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was about 15 at the time.  It was in a very remote area, all country.  We were walking down this dirt road and it was very dark, no street lights, when all of a sudden the whole area lit up with a very bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought, and I said this out loud was that we were getting a bad lightening storm.  I looked up at the sky and there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky.  We were all very confused as to for a second as to how that could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw this round bright light rising into the sky, to the left of us, changed direction and flew away very fast and was gone.  After thinking about it later I realized that whatever it was must have been pretty close to where we were.  Maybe we scared whatever it was but I will never forget how bright that light was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other incident was about ten years ago.  My wife and I were driving home from her parents in Memphis MI.  As I glanced out my drivers side window I noticed three objects flying in formation in the clear night sky.  Many colors coming from each, not flashing, just kind of glowing.  They were going very slow, much slower than anything I have ever seen, and then picked up speed and were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to look for more than a few seconds each time as I was driving but I did get a good look.  They were gone by the time I had a chance to pull off of the road.  Only lasted about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

A neighbor pounded on my door and asked me to come out and see a &#34;UFO&#34;. We were on the north shore of High Lake, Noble Co. , IN looking south. I saw what appeared to be an airplane traveling from east to west at quite a distance. I told my neighbor it was just an airplane. Suddenly it appeared to stop and I told him it was turning and either coming toward us or going away from us. Suddenly it shot upwards, looking like a &#34;shooting star&#34; only in the wrong direction, until it disappeared. Assuming it was originally traveling around 350 MPH like an airplane would, it had to take off in the upward direction at least 1500-2500 MPH. That was the night I became a believer in UFOs. The only discription I can give is that it looked like an airplane at a great distance, but what it did could not be explained by any air craft I know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Over the course of April-May 2002, this FI communicated in detail with the witness via email, telephone, and U.S. Mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness stated that in 1973 or 1974, she was a 27 YOA mother and home-maker living in suburban MACON GEORGIA. Her husband (now deceased) was an aviator and away from home at the time of the event. Her husband&#39;s cousin and family lived very close-by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Investigator&#39;s Note: Macon is one of the larger Georgia cities, sitting astride north-south I-75 in our state&#39;s &#34;center mass&#34;, with Warner Robbins AFB being about 14 miles due south, mostly very flat terrain).<n> <n><n> <n><n> WITNESS ACCOUNT - During the evening in question, the witness said it was very warm, the sky was clear, but with some clouds, perhaps above 5000 feet. The witness stated that she had put her baby to bed, fixed a glass of iced-tea and proceeded outside to sit on the patio in the dark. Within a short time, she noticed a GLOW coming across the tree tops to the SW, proceeding TOWARD her, and while enroute, passing directly over the parking lot of the &#34;Disabled American Veterans&#34; organization, which was located ACROSS the N-S road from her E-W residential street. Witness continued, stating that the GLOW was LOW-LEVEL and SILENT, continuously moving toward her in a SWIFT manner. As she watched the approach, the glow resolved itself and she observed a THICK LENS SHAPED OBJECT heading right toward her position. This object was still SILENT and steadily GLOWING in a bright YELLOW-ORANGE color......also described as AMBER. As it passed directly OVER the witness, she was able to determine from UNDERNEATH that is was actually a ROUND saucer-like craft, additionally described as being &#34;gigantic&#34;, like two ranch style homes placed together (WUFOD data fields.... ACTUAL SIZE-300 ft.; ALTITUDE-500 ft.+). Witness observed NO fuselage protrusions, portholes or the like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, the witness became nervous, ran inside and locked the door. She went to her rear bathroom window and watched as the craft departed, continuing on over the nearby homes to the NE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, she discussed the matter with her husband&#39;s cousin who told her that along with his wife and kids, he too had observed something similar. They debated if it was the same object, but the witness does not recall their final conclusion. She DOES recall a newspaper or TV news report about it, saying several other people described similar observations in Macon from that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OTHER RESEARCH- GUFOG investigator Officer Michael D. Hitt spent three years of intense research, focusing year by year, on ALL locally reported UFO phenomenon in Georgia from 1947 through 1987. This resulted in his 1999 publication documenting this activity (appx. 250 accounts). The period of 1973 in Georgia reflected the SAME TYPE of activity as that being reported nationally.......&#34;The Wave of 1973&#34;........as it is described by some of the top American researchers, Ronald Story, Peter Davenport, Dick Hall, Stanton Friedman, Jerome Clark, et al.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1973 in Georgia found reports POURING in from citizens, motorists, MANY law enforcement officers, pilots, reporters and news crews. These reports were being made to the various media, local police and other officials. Numerous of these reports were from central and south Georgia, including the MACON area where our primary witness lived.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer was a police Patrol Officer in 1973 and during the summer and autumn of that year, had been routinely assigned to temporary administrative duties after shooting and killing a deranged gunman. While working at night in the radio center during this period, MANY teletype messages from central and south Georgia were monitored as various agencies had patrol units actively pursuing and reporting &#34;unknowns&#34; from county to county. This included the MACON and central Georgia area where the witness lived and made her observation. A few of these teletype messages were preserved by this writer (if conditions had permitted, ALL would have been preserved!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the above circumstances, this writer feels that the MACON witness&#39; report is PROBABLY part of the &#34;1973 Wave&#34;, even though she cannot remember the exact date or year......stating either 1973 or maybe 1974.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The MACON witness was forthright and above board in ALL of her accounting and conversations with this investigator. The witness&#39; OUTSTANDING writing ability and diction was traced to growing up and being educated in England AND Europe. She did not muck about, being intelligent, observant and concise. One highly credible lady.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I imagine that bits and pieces from the &#34;Wave of 73&#34; and other eras will probably continue to come in and undergo some form of scrutiny by GUFOG or my friends and associates in MUFON of Georgia. Credible witnesses, such as described in this report, will hopefully add more pieces to the 1973 Georgia puzzle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As always, any past or present citizens of Georgia that might have information related to these events, can contact me at the GUFOG office in Fayetteville Georgia--- 678-817-4555; or email at &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;georgiaUFOgroup@webtv.net&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   GUFOG WILL HOLD THE IDENTITY OF ALL WITNESSES CONFIDENTIAL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tom Sheets, Director/GUFOG<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Tom Sheets, Director of Georgia UFO Group, for sharing the report with NUFORC.

7/1/73 21:00|Richmond|CA|Other|20 seconds|Three differently shaped, silent UFOs during two events, northbound over Richmond, California in early 1970's|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34054.html|38|ndxe197307| Three differently shaped, silent UFOs during two events, northbound over Richmond, California in early 1970&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> The date I&#39;ve given is a rough approximation and represents two events fairly close in time; I saw these sometime in the early seventies and filled this form out as roughly as it would accept date data.  In 1973 I would have been 10 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To give some idea of my ability as a witness, I point out that as a child I was very well informed of then-current and past aircraft, both military and civilian, and kept my eyes to the skies eagerly watching the planes flying out of Hamilton Field using Richmond as a flight corridor.  My dad took me to airshows and airports, and we even had a private tour of Moffett Field at one point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the course of two evenings, probably within a year or so of each other, I saw a total of three UFOs.  All three were shaped differently, and one event included two of them close together.  Unfortunately I cannot recall which two of the three described below were paired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both sitings were at dusk with enough light to illuminate the craft for visual observation.  All aircraft were northbound and on the same path used by airliners northbound out of Oakland Airport.  It is my impression that these may have been lower in altitude than the airliners typically flew, and that they may have had approximately the same maximum dimensions as airliners.  None displayed lights in my recollection, and none were audible.  In the case of the two which were paired, one UFO trailed the other rather closely - within a few craft lengths.  Velocity of all three was similar to that of the airliners I often watched going the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO #1 was shaped like a hockey puck and reminded me of one of the circular ice cream sandwiches I used to eat as a kid.  The outer edge exhibited some sort of framework or other features.  Come to think of it, for those who may be familiar, it looked a bit like the Oakland Coliseum (the covered structure, not the adjacent ballfield stadium).<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO #2 appeared simply as a pair of swept wings and was devoid of visible equipment or detail.  I don&#39;t believe either of the prior &#34;flying wing&#34; bombers operated by the USAF was still active, and the B-2 was still a gleam in some engineer&#39;s eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO #3 gave the impression of a cigar or banana with an aft dorsal appendage.  My thought, then and now, is that it was much like the fuselage of a conventional airliner - missing the wings and horizontal stabilizers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We did not have an air conditioner at the time, so we had all the windows and doors open trying to stay as cool as possible. When it happened it did so very quickly. As I said we were watching TV, with the TV on the north side of the room, the doorway to the kitchen on the west and the exit to the bedroom and the front door on the south. As we were watching TV (except my mother who was looking into the kitchen) a 6inch sphere of pale orange light entered through the kitchen window, and traveling very quickly came into the living room, left through the north doorway and went out the front door. It happened so quickly that I turned to my mother and asked her if she saw that, which she did. Apparently my father and brother who sitting closer to the TV, and who were directly under its flightpath (6ft off the floor) didn&#39;t notice anything. As I said it was pale orange and glowed, and as my mother put it (who is present at this writing, and from whom the bulk of this report comes) &#34;it looked like a ball of fire&#34;. It took about 3 seconds for it to cover the distance it traveled (About 10ft through the kitchen, 6ft into the living room, turned and traveled about 8ft into the bedroom, crossed it (7ft) and went out the door.). Also it moved in a straight line as it came through the kitchen, then with a slight up and down bobbing motion as it crossed the living room, then again traveled in a straight line out the front door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was stationary as I carried water buckets to the barn for the calves on our farm.  I called my sister to come and see it. I pointed it out to her and we noted the objects specific location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued our farm chores and I looked up in its direction a few minutes later but discovered that it had moved to another fixed spot about 30 degrees away in the sky.

I was driving south on Rt. 70S (now Rt. 270) and had just gone under the Shady Grove Road overpass.  The day was gloomy, almost like a foggy-rainy day but it was not raining; the clouds just seemed to be very low.  As I came out from the underpass, I saw this &#34;big thing&#34; above me.  It had no wings that I could determine and I tried hard to speed up to keep getting a better look.  I probably got up to about 80, but it was no contest.  It was black (I could only see the underside at first), and at arm&#39;s length I would say it was about 6-8 inches in diameter, a real big-un as they say. As it continued south in front of me and drew away, I could see that it had green sequentially flashing lights along the rear (but I could not, of course, see whether these lights went all around the object).  It then slowly changed course toward the East and I lost sight of it because I had to drive.  I think the object was going about 300-400 mph -- it reminded me of the way a C130 had looked the day a friend said, &#34;It isn&#39;t going that slow, it is just that big.&#34;  I let it go out of my mind, but the next morning I heard on the radio that the Air Force had reported that the object seen by a number of people was an experimental plane they were testing.  It did seem to me that something that size would have had a budget that people would be arguing about.  If it was a secret, why were they testing it in broad daylight?  And, most of all, why didn&#39;t it have any wings?  I would love to hear from anyone else who has seen something similar.<n>

It got very hot at night and we used to sleep every night in tents in the back yard to stay cool. We were sitting beside our tent and I looked up at the stars as I always loved to look at them. There was a red star that caught my eye and all of a sudden, a red light about the same size of the star came from it and moved at least 5 time faster across the sky than any plane I ever saw to this day. I ran in the house to tell my grandmother about it. She came out within seconds and it had already reached the other side of the house. We were all in awe over this and then all of a sudden there were many of these lights all looking like they were coming from every star in the sky. It was really weird because they all looked like they were the same color of the twinkling star they came from. This was definately not a meteor shower. I watch them every chance I can. All the lights moved from one end of the sky to the other crossing each others path as if they were just missing each other. They never left a trail and just looked like stars moving across the sky. The lights never went out and it lasted at least a half hour. They never blinked like the stars they seemed to have came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kind of freak my other family members and after a small amount of time they would not even admit it happened.

7/1/73|Titusville|PA|Unknown||My grandmother awoke one morning to find a circular indentation, 10-15 feet in diameter, in the middle of her yard .|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62115.html|44|ndxe197307| My grandmother awoke one morning to find a circular indentation, 10-15 feet in diameter, in the middle of her yard .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 39-years-old, and I am guessing that what happened to my grandmother occurred in the summer of 1973 or 1974, in Titusville, PA.  I would have been about 5-years-old, and I have my own memory of what I saw.  However, my father revealed to me years later that there was more to the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My memory of the event is as follows.  My family showed up at my grandmother’s house for a summer visit.  (We lived about 6 hours away.)  We pulled up to greet our relatives, who stood around talking about something that seemed unusual and important.  My mother or father explained to me at that time that the circle on the ground in front of me (in the middle of my grandmother’s yard) had recently and suddenly appeared.  I asked many questions for clarification, and the information I received was that one night something heavy seems to have been set there.  No one knew what but the speculation and joking was that a UFO had landed there.  Part of the conversation was that there were no tire marks or any other evidence around to suggest that someone created the perfect circle.  It seems like a big drum could have created the impression, but how anyone could put a huge, heavy drum there and why they would do so and then remove it made no sense.   My brothers, cousins, and I all decided to play with the impression, creating games from the circle and having fun while the adults chatted in a serious manner.  I would estimate that the circle’s diameter measured 10-15 feet across.  And, as I recall, the indentation has smashed and broken the grass (not burned or scorched).  Brown dirt was visible in the groove that had been cut into the ground.  I remember the groove of the circle as being more v-shaped than flat.  The depth of the groove may have been about 2-3 inches.  I really can’t be certain of the exact appearance and depth of the groove, but it was deep and pronounced enough to be seen from her house, from the neighbor’s yard, and from the driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later, while in college, I asked my father about my memory, about which he expounded.  Apparently, my grandmother had been experiencing strange things a few days to a couple of weeks prior to our arrival.  That was, in fact, why we came to visit her.  The events had spooked her so much that she wanted company with her.  My active, pragmatic, not prone to exaggeration Pennsylvania Dutch grandmother had awakened one or two nights to find herself standing and staring out the window at a light.  She felt as if someone was calling her name.  She’d &#34;snap out of it&#34; and go back to bed.  Then one night she awakened to find herself downstairs in front of her sliding glass doors looking out into the yard (at the exact spot that the circle appeared).  This really alarmed her because she had no memory of coming down the steps.  My grandmother was born with a problem with her hip socket that gave her a limp her whole life.  Making her way down the steps was a bit of a challenge to her, requiring careful balance and use of the railings.  Again, when she found herself standing at her door, she had felt that she had been staring at a bright light and that someone outside was calling her name, beckoning her to go outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During these events is when the circle appeared.  My father believes that my grandmother had contacted someone about the circle and that a man from a local university came and collected a sample of the soil from the circular impression for testing.  My grandmother passed away in 1990, and my father never knew what came of the soil testing.  I don’t believe that anyone thought to take a photo of the impression, which had disappeared by the next summer when we visited again.  (We kids tried to find it but couldn’t.)  My family has been curious about &#34;the circle&#34; and what happened to my grandmother a few nights that summer for many years.  I don’t know how posting my story can provide any answers or additional information, but I feel compelled to share it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
