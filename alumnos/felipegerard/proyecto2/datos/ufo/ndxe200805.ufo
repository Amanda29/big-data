Sitting on the front of a boat underway, looking at the stars.  Four adult friends, all witness this event.  While looking at the big dipper, we noticed a triangle shape outlined by three large soft glowing  lights one on each corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO looked very large, and moved slowly with no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other lights visible from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing is that we could see through the object.  It looked translucent and we could see stars passing behind it as it moved across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

S. Navy N.O.S.S. surveillance satellite system.  At first, we thought that might be a possible explanation of the sighting, but we observe that when the three NOSS satellites are orbiting, usually NUFORC r<n>

I was about 3 to 4 miles North of Highway 85 when I saw an intense flashing light to the left of the road, about 100 feet in the air.  The flying light was flashing from a less intense light to a really bright light and did not appear to be moving.  But after watching it a couple of seconds, it appeared to start moving towards me.  I asked my wife, &#34;What the heck is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched it approach and pass very quickly to our left, still in the air.  I was looking forward trying to drive and looking back trying to watch the object.  After it had passed us, I noticed another flying, flashing bright light which appeared to be going the same direction as the first flying, flashing bright light.  Both objects moved quickly in the direction of Highway 85 and disappeared out of sight within a matter of 6 seconds.  I could not put a size to it because there was no shape to it, just a bright flashing light.  I do not remember ever seeing that intense of a light at night before.  The entire time I saw the objects was only about 10 seconds.<n>

There was no sound and it was really low in the sky, there is no way this could be an aircraft such as a small plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds they disappeared, they didn&#39;t shoot off or go into the distance, they just disappeared. Shortly after a jet fighter flew over and headed off North.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/31/08 21:40|Newburgh|IN|Light|5 minutes|Five or more people saw a string of bright red lights hoving in the sky that disappeared|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63634.html|5|ndxe200805| Five or more people saw a string of bright red lights hoving in the sky that disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the daughter of the witness. My father, mother, and uncle were sitting outside. My mother came into the house to tell me they (mom, dad, and uncle) were going to drive down to a place where they saw a string of big red lights in the sky. They went there, and as they got there, two cars turning the corner suddenly stop as they approached the lights. But when they actually got there, the lights were gone. This took about five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father described them as big red Christmas lights hovering stationary in the sky. My mother described them like exploded fireworks that hadn’t disappeared. My uncle didn’t give a description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father just now, at 21:54 of the same day, told me he called the sheriff and reported the event. The sheriff said that about a year ago, the exact same thing was reported in the exact same area.<n>

It was our turn to show the public around the evening sky as members of the Peoria Astronomical Society.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were watching the storm when a dark moving shape appeared in the periferal vision of my left eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The black circle was approaching from the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a goose flying toward the pond behind the observatory. We had seen a couple take off from there a little earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, as it got closer I could not see any wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My observing partner was engrossed in watching the storm and had not noticed this object coming right at us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called his attention to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Is that a balloon?” he said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My thought exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But, we both quickly realized this object was moving very fast, and in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> “Could a balloon move in a straight line that fast?” I said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both quickly concluded that did not seem plausible to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We each looked at our cell phones. It was 8:40 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object passed over us we saw a different shape. It had looked round while coming toward us. As it passed overhead we saw it looked like a capital B laying on its side. And, as it passed overhead it tilted slightly to the south showing a streak of gray, but the color was flat, not reflective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was not any sound We looked at each other and watched the item disappear into the horizon to the east never altering its speed as far as we could tell or its direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a newspaper editor and amateur astronomer. My observing partner is also an amateur astronomer.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was in the late afternoon on a sunny day. This light was at cloud level and I would describe it as looking like a non-twinkling star, but five times brighter then any star in the sky. I watched it for 15 minutes and then went inside for ten minutes and when I came back outside it was gone. It appeared 45 seconds after my Dad ask me the question..&#34;Do you believe in UFOS?&#34;...to which I answered.&#34;I have no doubt, whatsoever, that they are here and are very real&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was high in the sky, about where you would expect to see an airplane. It looked like a silver disc,  is it possible someone was playing a hoax with some kind of flying silver disc. yes.  I definetly think it applies to the &#39;unidentified flying object&#39; as opposed to an alien spacecraft, I wrote this to mainly add credence to any other claim you might have recieved for a ufo in that area at that time by someone else. I only saw it briefly and I was the only one in the car at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had a single white strobing light on the lower of the points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a few pictures on a 2MP camera, however the object did not appear.  after looking a little closer at one picture, a white streak was noticed where the object should have been!!!  Perfect timing?  Morphing??  who knows we never saw the object again...<n>

The standing still object shot lillte tiny orange objects to the second orange object about four times. Ojects then began to dim and then dissapperd into space.<n>

In the corner of my eye I saw a light appear, thinking it was a shooting star I turned and looked.  It was in the southern sky on a clear night, I quickly focused my eyes on the light.  Immediately I came to the conclusion that the light wasn’t a shooting star but rather something else.  The light grew brighter for about 3 to 4 seconds, resembling a car light coming closer.  The light was not very large; it started about the size of a star and grew brighter.  I asked my date what she thought the growing light could be, she was uncertain but was quick to believe it must be an airplane.  I too thought it might be an airplane because that would be the most logical explanation.  Once the light stopped growing brighter it was motionless for a split second and then began to move from right to left in the sky.  It started on a straight course, which made me think it really was a plane or satellite but then the light began to shuffle up and down.  Moving unlike anything I have seen before.  Immediately when it began moving up and down I told my date it was a UFO.  I asked her, isn’t that a UFO? She was very scarred and reluctant to admit something like that, but once she saw the light move in the way it did she too said it must be unidentified flying object.  It moved across the sky fast, moving oddly for about 4 seconds the light vanished into the sky.  It seemed to disappear from the sky with no trace of it ever being there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date unspecified by witness.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.  PD))<n>

It had blinking lights:  red and green that appeared to be blinking in a clockwise pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was talking to a friend of mine on the cellphone at the time and commented on seeing this object up above me.

The night is warm and the sky clear.  I always look to the northern sky for the northern lights.  I have never seen them but my wife did a few years ago.  Anyway, I noticed an extremely bright (white light) object moving from west to east.  At first I thought it was a plane with the landing lights on, but realized the lights were far too bright and that it was traveling the wrong direction.  Also thought it was moving too fast to be a commercial airliner.  I then suspected the space station due to the size (maybe 15 to 20 times bigger than the largest star in it&#39;s traverse).  I looked away for just a second and when I turned back it was gone!  I could not believe that it had disappeared so quickly as it was not near the horizon or mountains the last time I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came inside, got on the computer and checked the space station and satellite orbits.  According to the Govt.  Nothing passed even close to that area of the sky.<n>

The lights magnitude 1. I had time to walk to the house from the front gate about 190 feet to my front door and garbed my 10/50 binoculars when I look at the lights in my binoculars the was now three lights making a triangle with the point heading south It was directly over me and my house at 90 degrees. The three lights where separate from each other and gave off a elongated white light elongated from north to south you could also see all the stars behind the lights. The lights where spaced in a perfect triangle one thumbs length apart. I called my my wife out from the back of the house and she came out and witnessed the triangle she saw had trouble locating them at first the she saw them at that point a shooting star shot through the triangle and they disappeared around the 70 degree mark to the south. The whole sighting lasted around 11 minutes I did a search at the web site heavens above and there was nothing fling over my house at that time on that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/30/08 20:30|Pensacola|FL|Disk|3 minutes (approx)|Amber lights in formation (flying disk?) over I-10, headed towards Escambia Bay.|8/21/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83222.html|21|ndxe200805| Amber lights in formation (flying disk?) over I-10, headed towards Escambia Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was May 30, 2008, when my wife and I were driving back home after eating at a restaurant downtown.  We were on I-10 eastbound, driving 70-ish, in abnormally non-existent traffic for a Friday night.  When we were a couple of miles past the Davis Hwy interchange, I noticed a light twin airplane passing overhead and to my left (north of highway), going south, low in altitude (200-300 ft) presumably for landing (as we could see landing lights and gear extended). This isn&#39;t unusual, the traffic patterns frequently pass over for that particular runway.  But, a bright ring of 10 or more amber lights behind/beside the plane startled me, thinking someone just launched a ring-shaped fireworks display in dangerously close proximity to this landing plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the plane continued, apparently ignorant of these lights, the mystery lights seemed to shut off, and disappear rather quickly.  I quickly asked my wife if she had seen these &#34;fireworks,&#34; as she was in the front passenger seat of our jeep wrangler.  She said she had not, but as I started to describe the lights (8-12 in number) as we continued down the road, they reappeared, as if they &#34;turned on&#34; with a switch, still to my left, above the trees, but at least 1000-2000ft (east) from where I saw it last.  It seemed as though whatever it was, it was moving at least 80+ mph, since it reappeared slightly ahead of us, and we were going E @ 70 mph. My wife saw it this time, and agreed it did look like fireworks (in shape and color), only to watch it disappear seconds later again, instantly. We were now a little confused, knowing it was not a plane, blimp, flares, or a mobile fireworks platform.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued east, and are struggling to say anything further, it reappears again, instantly, and it is now apparent that these lights (8-12, unsure of number) must be fixed to a solid object, and are flashing at an interval of a couple seconds on (all of them), and then off simultaneously for a couple seconds. It was apparently tracking to the east-south-east, heading towards the bay and beyond. As the interstate curves to the north approaching Scenic Highway, the object crossed over the lanes, and because of its altitude and direction, my wife thought it would hit the Ramada Inn. It passed over though, still blinking its amber lights rhythmically, and we followed it on the off-ramp to Scenic Hwy. When we got to the traffic light, my wife frantically pleaded that we go south on Scenic and follow it. I just sat and stared as it continued east-southeast over the bay, apparently unable to speak or drive, or follow my wife&#39;s instructions. She asked me several more times, and! I instead turned North to go home. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t follow it, I wished that I had, but something majorly psychological was computing in my brain, and refusing to accept what we knew we just saw. I had never seen a ufo before, but my life has not been the same since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am glad that my wife saw it as well, otherwise I would think I was crazy. We went home and drew independent pictures, and the only variance was our perspective, while I saw a complete ring, she saw something closer to that of an omega/horse-shoe/open ring. The color was the same in both of our perspectives, somewhere between orange and yellow, amber would be the best word in my opinion. The distance/size was nearly impossible to perceive, it could have been 30 feet above, 300 feet above, or 3000 feet above. The limiting factors were the trees it passed over, the plane it did not collide with, and the high cloud ceiling. In my opinion, it would seem as though it were close to 300 feet in altitude, considering it cleared the trees, and seemed to follow the path of the interstate. If it were at that distance, I would estimate it&#39;s size to be 50-100 feet in &#34;diameter&#34;, but that&#39;s only an estimation based on estimated height. The light twin airplane seen at the beginning of the! sighting was estimated nearly 200-300 feet ( could have been even 500 feet ) in altitude, and with my life experience around planes/airports/military air stations, I can safely assume that the wingspan of the plane was 20-30 feet tops. The ring was nearly twice the size of the plane when they were in &#34;close&#34; proximity to each other, but I don&#39;t have experience around such phenomenon to know what normal is for size or distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not hear a sound, but our Jeep is noisy on the freeway. By comparison, the airplane was audible and sounded like a turboprop (it may have been a reciprocating prop w/ 3-blade engines, however, not really sure at the glance we had in those conditions), and was briefly and typically heard as it passed overhead. We don&#39;t know what the environmental conditions for wind were, windows were up and the temperature was unknown as well (A/C was probably on), there were no visible stars or moon, cloud ceiling was high enough not to reflect billboard lights or other urban lighting that is typical in the area. When we rolled to a stop at the offramp traffic light, the road noise diminshed and no sound was perceived as the ring of lights continued east over the bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have considered and reconsidered repeatedly what it was or was not, and can only say what it was not based on several key facts. 1) It was not a satellite, I have seen hundreds in my lifetime, none of them were amber, or traveling in coordinated groups/formation. 2) It was not meteor or comet, I have seen hundreds of either in my lifetime, including several meteor showers and eye-visible comets, they do not remain in formation over 3 miles and flash off and on repeatedly. 3) It was not military flares, I have seen those on t.v. and other videos, I am fairly certain they would not be dropped over the interstate or next to civilian aircraft on approach to landing, not to mention the residential areas that surrounded the freeway. There are many bases nearby, both air force and navy, and Eglin&#39;s expanse seems like a more logical testing site for such activities as flare drops. 4) I don&#39;t believe it was a blimp, the size could match, but the lights (we frequently see the Tostit! o&#39;s and Goodyear blimps at night and day flying to KPNS) and speed (over 70 MPH) seem unreasonable. 5) I don&#39;t think it was a civilian aircraft due to the other air traffic&#39;s close proximity, and there were no typical light patterns (no strobes, nav lights, or anti-collision lights), and I have never seen a disc shaped plane (I think the government mothballed most 50 years ago for various reasons). 6) The only other rational reason is bunk as well, if it was a &#39;top-secret&#39; military aircraft, I think the above mentioned location (interstate 10, densely residential NE Pensacola, planes landing at the same time) would have blown the cover of a black project. Again, with nearby expanses of unpopulated testing grounds like Eglin AFB and others, I don&#39;t see why a secret aircraft would fly directly over I-10 or get dangerously close to other landing airplanes, that is not very inconspicuous, or top secret either. That leaves ball lightning or swamp gas, and I have never heard of s! uch phenomenon appearing as our sighting did. But I am not an ! expert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grew up in the area, my father was a Navy pilot and flight instructor, and my time in Civil Air Patrol years ago has provided experience around many civilian and military airplanes.  We do not have photos, or video, I think even if we had such equipment at the time, we were too dumbfounded to even use such devices.  I will send in drawings/renderings that have been made since.  Not much help but a picture says a thousand words.<n>

As we were driving into the neighborhood, we saw a large black object in the sky.  It was shaped kind of like a parallelogram.  It was completely still, no wavering, wind movement, etc.  When we got to my house we stood in the driveway and watched it for a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it gradually moved out of our vision, behind a house high up on a hill.  It moved so slowly that it didn’t seem like it was moving, until the house was in the way.  We didn’t hear any sounds.  This was late in the afternoon, shortly before sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are still puzzled by what we saw.<n>

It was round and had blue tinted lights that went around the entire saucer. The lights were circular and were spaced evenly around the saucer. It was moving up and down, and side to side in a smooth manner. It would go in one direction and hover for a few seconds then continue on down the road. We made a u-turn to see if we could catch another glimpse of it. The saucer was kind of going up the hill with us. I got closer and closer and eventually it was about 10 to 15 feet away from us in the car. It seemed to have flashed a bright light at us. It continued to hover around us and then it disappeared into the canyon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was parked in the outfield and I noticed a very fast moving red dot in the sky, I followed it for about 90 degrees of travel and the red light grew bigger and changed into a blue flicker/flame.  I ran to alert my partner about this fire in the sky but was unable to take my eyes of it or get their attention over their vechile.  The light turned and began swirling the clouds in opposite directions and then two wings appeared with bright yellow slits.  It may not be wings because the clouds were moving so intensely, unlike anything I have ever seen and thus were blocking the middle of the UFO.  However,  the object moved closer and I observed the yellow slits to be vents sucking in the clouds, or atleast the cause of the cloud distruption.  It moved through the sky towards me unlike any thing possible, did not make a sound, moved downward slightly then dissapeared.  I ran and stopped my co-worker&#39;s progress and as they disembarked their trackter, the UFO appeared seemingly above us, very large for only brief second or two before dissapearing.  I drew it&#39;s picture and wrote down what occured immediatley on the back of my vechile checklist for daily inspections.  I radio-ed my boss to tell him what conspired and all 45 city employees think I am lying, or saw something that wasn&#39;t what I described.  It was a brief enouncter but it was the most interesting, intense, and scariest moment of my life.  To give the exact description the blue flame / flickering light was on top in the middle of the oval craft, and I could only see the bright yellow vents sucking up or pushing away all the clouds.  The turbelance from the vents made it impossible to distingu! ish the what the middle and majority of the craft looked like.  I believe that the two wings are not two wings but one long line of bright yellow vents, and like I said earlier the clouds were moving in a way I thought not possible.<n>

I was scared so I didn&#39;t bother to stop and didn&#39;t even think to take a picture. I just wanted out of there. As I drove up the road, they didn&#39;t appear to move at all.

It flashed at regular timed intervals of what seemed to be 3 to 4 seconds, but what was amazing, was the distance it traveled between each flash.  The distances varied, and seemed to be from miles, to hundreds of miles, depending on what it&#39;s height was, which I could not determine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This flashing and traveling continued in a  large circle of  what appeared to be from 15 degrees above the horizon, in the south, going overhead, to that same angle in the north, then returning more to the East, and back to the south again, and going out of site behind the trees in my south west.  There were about 10 or 11 flashes, in a total viewing time of 30 to 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 71 year old retired construction manager, and minister. I am a licensed private pilot.<n>

We continued to drive along the road which follows the river until the river turned the bend and was gone. I have pitures on my cell phone and my friend has video capabilty on her cell phone and took an ongoing video. We are at a loss to explain what the lights were. I do not know of any airplane or airborn vehicle that could hover and move that slow at a consistant speed, this vehicle was about 50 ft off the surface of the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We finished cleaning the fish at the fish cleaning station near what they refer to as the “primitive campground” and we were leaving the park driving west when my husband and I both noticed two bright lights off to the right side (north) of our vehicle, they resembled headlights on a car and the were both pointing straight towards the park that we had just left (east, the opposite direction we were driving at the time of the sighting), up above the trees at approximately at 150-200 feet into the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked at each other and said, “What the hell is that?” And both agreed that we had no idea, but we knew it wasn’t an airplane or a helicopter because it was too low and it was just sort of hovering there.  He said to me, “Get out your cell phone and take a picture!”  So, I proceeded to get out my phone and I was starting to shake because it wasn’t very far above the trees and who knows what might happen— all I could envision was this thing changing direction and pointing its lights at our vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled down the electric window on our vehicle, but before I could point my camera phone and get the picture, it lifted into what looked like either a very, very low cloud or a type of haze or dry ice looking puff.  There wasn’t any sound coming from this object at all, it was like dead silence. We could see the light within this cloud formation sort of glowing, but we kept on driving because he knew that I was scared and I think he was too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept trying to look back at the location as we hit the main highway and headed home driving south on Mehaffey Bridge Road, but I couldn’t see anything from that point on, not even the glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (We both agreed that we would take a lie detector test if nobody believed us.  It was very bizarre.)<n>

These two were followed shortly by a third.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;chasing&#34; objects slowly pulsed with a very bright light, taking maybe 5 seconds to cycle from dim to bright to dim again.

Was it really a moving star? Does a moving star exist or it’s just my perception that there is a moving star and I perceived it as a moving star. That is how I was taught in my school days. Was it a satellite? This question seems more of logical to me. What do you say?   I was looking at the sky. Then suddenly a star (my perception) come to the partition of the sky I was looking at and then it was moving horizontally, parallel to the ground. It looked bright somewhat like an extra star with a bit more of brightness. It moved straight, parallel and horizontal if the partition is considered as a view plane. I even prayed what I wanted my life to be, looking at it because in Nepal we have a belief if you see a shooting star and wish for something then it gets fulfilled though it was not a falling star. I have seen falling star seven times in duration of 10 minutes approx. I think 3-4 months before and approximately the same time as today. About the shape, I think practically it didn’t had a shape but if I have to be specific then I would choose to say it was like star, a big point in the graph. I could have easily slept rather to research on internet to share what I saw today. But I choose to wake up still and its 4:45 am now. I would like to know if any expert has some points to explain me what was that because I’m very much interested in space and its infinite property.<n>

I decided to look at the stars for a while, it was a clear night. Suddenly one of the stars began to move at a very very high altitude. It moved at a constant pace and it began to shut off and then blink, move a bit more at the same speed and then blink on again. One of the blinks was significantly brighter than the others. It mimicked a star. While staring I got a feeling of wellbeing all around me and I got goose bumps. I kept my eye on it and tried to follow as far as I could have when a low flying plane came by and distracted me. I could not find it again but I knew what I saw didn’t blink like a plane because the lights on a plane do not go off for 5 seconds at a time, they are constantly blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw something in the sky that looked like a spider with a light on its belly.  At first I thought it was a balloon but in the light breeze yesterday it was not moving. Also It was as high as a helicopter so the visual was not that ba to see and the sky was dead clear and even though it was day the sun was not quite all the way shining but against the sky it was clear. It had long stringy arms or tentacles which were blue and white not really straight but slightly curly. I went in the house after watching it for 15 min hoping to see a plane or something else and when to call 2 tv statins channel 8 and 9 which I called channel 9 today to see if they when to se Washington dc to see if they saw what I saw and the said they went there and saw nothing. I returned outside aroung 7:17 am and the arms were shorter and more curly and tha sky was getting sunny. I went back to bed. I awakened at 1 pm and nothing was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(I&#39;m from the west coast and live near the ocean, so the heat and humidity was hard to take.) I believe I was facing south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just over the trees I spotted a group of bright lights blinking on and off. One would stay on for about 5 seconds then go out, then another would light, etc. They never came on all at the same time. They were stationary and in no particular pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I figured there was a group of cell phone towers or something on a mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got up in the morning, I looked the area over through binoculars and there were no towers at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I humorously noted the event in my blog and didn&#39;t think much about it until I ran across this video on youtube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlwnfU3fUbU  I don&#39;t know if the video is a hoax but those lights looked and behaved like the ones I saw that night in Arkansas.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As if the &#34;ufo&#34; was being chased by the &#34;jet&#34;. I could hear the sound of a jet long after i couldn&#39;t see them any more.

It is a clear night, there is some residual sunlight from the sunset and plenty of light pollution.  After a 20 minute walk, it&#39;s a little after 9 when I point out a bright light in the sky.  I was pretty sure it was Venus, astronomy is a hobby of mine and I can recognize alot of objects in the sky.  I said to my brother, I don&#39;t think Venus is out after sunset in the summer, what do you think?  He says he doesn&#39;t believe it would be out either.  We stare at it for a couple minutes more when all of a sudden, as if it were shrinking, it disappears.  We both looked at eachother in disbelief, &#34;did that just happen&#34;?  The manner in which this light disappeared was too weird, it couldn&#39;t have been a flare, it was in the sky for too long, and the light&#39;s intensity remained constant.  It was straight out of a UFO tv show, this thing went from being the brightest object in the sky, to completely gone in about 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for details about how the UFO looked, all I can say is that it looked like Venus, it didn&#39;t twinkle however, and it never moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I at first thought it was the space station so emaied NASA but got no response.  The jet had contrails but the cigar had none.  The plane reflected the sun set and was pinkish but the cigar was not.  It went out of sight  in a blink, not fading from sight but bam, just gone and the plane was still there.  I couldn&#39;t get the time in the slot, but it was about 20:00 to 23:00 (8PM)traveling south to north<n>

It appeared to either be a silver object very far away relecting the sunlight, or perhaps a plane with its landing light strongly shining in my direction.  The object appeared from my perspective to be stationary in the sky at about 20 degrees above the horizon.  I assumed is was a plan eith traveling toward me (explaining the landing/running lights shining brightly) or it was traveling away from me.  Either way, it appeared to be still in the sky from my vantage.  I watched it between races at the meet for 3 - 4 minutes, just thinking about what it could be.  (Some track meets are boring.)  When the next 100 meter ruace began, I watched the race, then looked back at the spot in the sky where I had seen the reflection just 30 seconds before.  Nothing was there.  No relection, no lights, nothing.  I continued to search above the spot, below, right and left.  Nothing.  No trees were obstructing my view; I was looking across the spur of the track marking the spot of the object above some natural landmarks on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It would have been near Toledo, Ohio or Findlay, Ohio possibly.  If anyone else saw something, I did too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was in a shape of an X. So i just looking away and looking at the ufo seeing if its there. But then i loose sight of it so i look around for a min and i see it but this is closer to the moon. So i get all wierded out and im sill looking at it. But then i see 5 of the X shaped ufos lined up in a strait line. Then i get up right away get my hamster bring here to here cage and get my dad.

5/28/08 16:50|Lisle|IL|Circle|10 minutes|Afternoon sighting of 15+ ufo's that changed colors and were the size of stars in the night sky.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63584.html|49|ndxe200805| Afternoon sighting of 15+ ufo&#39;s that changed colors and were the size of stars in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 4:50 pm CST on May 28, 2008 in Lisle, IL.  I was standing facing east (sun was behind me) walking home from a park with my baby and 3 neighborhood kids (range in age from 8 to 5).  The sky was perfectly blue- not a single cloud.  I looked at the sky and pointed and asked the kids “What’s that?”  One of the girls said it looks like the “Big Dipper” (only it had more “stars” in it).  I realized then that even though it looked like stars in the night sky they started shifting and moving around slightly, while still staying in the same area.  I knew that it wasn’t stars – they were UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a main ship (white) that never really moved- it was the largest (comparable to seeing a planet in the night sky – maybe a little bigger).  There were multiple ships with this main one- they would disappear/vanish and then reappear.  They would change color- from white to red to green.  Mostly, the small ships looked like white dots – there were many of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, I counted 8 – but, there were as many as 15+.   Airplanes passed the area (flying below the UFO’s) several times.  I KNOW these objects were not planes.  About 10 minutes went by and they were still in view; I took 4 pictures with my Blackberry camera but nothing really turned out because they were so small.  As we began walking home, we looked up at the sky again- maybe a minute or two went by – and all the UFO’s were gone.  I checked several more times on our walk home and even later this evening and saw nothing.<n>

5/27/08 23:30|Harrington|WA|Light|10-15 seconds|Peculiar reflection albedo from International Space Station|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63569.html|53|ndxe200805| Peculiar reflection albedo from International Space Station<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was viewing the night sky, looking to the north, and noticed a quite bright light, which was moving across the sky, from my left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought the light was the flare from an Iridium flare, many of which I have seen before tonight.  That was my first impression, given that the illumination from the object appeared to flare up, and then begin to subside, much the way an Iridium satellite is seen to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, however, perhaps 2-3 seconds after the flare subsided, the reflection flared up a second time, such that the second flare was brighter than the first.  This surprised me, since I had never seen an Iridium satellite flare more than once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not knowing what the object was, I recorded the time, and then immediately checked the www.Heavens-Above.com website for Iridium flares, and discovered that it had, indeed, been the International Space Station that I had observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps there are more items attached to the ISS framework that create a “double flare” effect, but in the dozens, or hundreds, of times that I have witnessed an overflight of the ISS, I have never observed that effect.  In fact, I have never witnessed the reflection albedo from the ISS to fluctuate, at all, until it has flown into the Earth’s shadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was crystal clear, at the time of the sighting, so variable light overcast probably was not the cause of the variation in illumination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will observe the ISS on subsequent nights, in order to determine whether this is a normal phenomenon.<n>

I was looking out the window of my apartment which faces a huge parking lot in a shopping center.  A large bright red rectangular object suddenly appeared over the parking lot and hovered a few seconds and then took off flying over our apartment building going east at an incredible (what seemed like super sonic) speed and quickly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very close and appeared to be about 150&#39; long and maybe 50&#39; in width and 50&#39; in height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very shaken by this experience and I feel sure that at 7am in the morning there must have been other people who saw this object.<n>

Curious I drove out to his location and he then pointed out what he was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object in the sky was bright and blinking many different colors. When it was not blinking it blended into the sky like a star. After about 3 min. of watching this object it now had started moving up, down, right, left and diagonal. He had told me it was moving earlier also. After looking at it for 10 min. I stoped looking at it so my eyes would adjust and I would know it was not just an optical elusion. We then looked around in the sky to see if there was others. There was 3 total. They would light up very bright then get dim. They would move in all sorts of directions. They also had something in common with each other, they all blinked many different colors, they moved in weird ways and 2 of them stayed inbetween 2 stars. The other was the most active and got very bright then dim. The object also moved in every direction and fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object started out about 50 degrees up from the ground. It would then drop to about 25-30 degrees then back up. That&#39;s not it. After awhile I had though my eyes were playing tricks on me until a plane that was flying at the same altitude and directly towards the object came about. It seemed to effect the object. The plane stayed at the same speed and altitude. As the plane got closer the object started lighting up like a strobe light of colors and shot straight at the plane. It then bobbed up and down. After the plane passed it then moved up to about 60 degrees in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects went on lighting up for about 2 and a half hours till&#39; we needed to go home. I have never seen anything like this in my life. I know what a plane looks like in the sky and also a satilite. This was not either one. There was 8 people total that seen this in our town. 6 that were with us. My boyfriend, boyfriend&#39;s mother, his 2 of his best friends, my brother and me. The other two were passing us in the road and stopped to see what we were doing. One was the ensurance agent for our town and his son. It almost made me sick when I seen these objects. Tomorow we are going out to see if they are there again. I will write again if they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD))<n>

Ursa Major was clearly visible without the aid of the binoculars, but some other constellations were not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 22:55, three teardrop shaped objects, each appearing about three times the size of Mizar &amp; Alcor through the binoculars flew from West to East through my field of view.  They were in a triangle pattern, very similar to a flock of birds.  I lowered the binoculars to view with my naked eye, but the objects were not visible at that point.  I viewed again through the binoculars, and was able to re-find the objects, still moving along the same trajectory, and with the same velocity, this time just further East of Ursa Major.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to observing stars of Ursa Major, and approximately one minute later saw a single teardrop shaped object, exactly like the previous three, traveling in the same West to East trajectory as the ones described previously, only this one seemed to be traveling at about three times the speed of the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I went in to explain to my wife, and then came back out for another five minutes or so, but saw no more objects of that nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near a private air field, and I am very aware of how a small plane appears in the night sky.  These objects were just solid white, with no blinking whatsoever, and appeared to be traveling much faster than any plane I have ever witnessed, including jets.  There was also no sound associated with the objects.  I cannot explain why Ursa Major was clearly visible with the naked eye, and these objects were not, considering they appeared larger than the stars through the lenses of the binoculars.<n>

At around 10pm, one of our friends noticed a bright light moving rapidly from southeast to northwest.  There was no sound at all.  The light was not blinking and there was only one light.  It was about 3 – 4mm at arms length with a slight yellowish ness to it.  I thought it looked a little oval in shape.  It was much too big to be a satellite (I don’t think they have lights anyway - ?).  Its path was straight as an arrow and its speed was constant.  My 16 year old son thought he could see it wavering very slightly.  If it was an airplane or a helicopter there would be definite sound and blinking lights.  As it reached the horizon there were some clouds silhouetted in the sky, I could see the light go through or above them, it was hard to tell.  Either way, there were clouds between us and the light.  So I estimated its altitude as being quite high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 10:20pm, one of our party noticed a bright flash to the south, about the size of three or four average size stars combined.  No one else saw it at that time.  We don’t know if the lights had anything to do with each other or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 10:30pm, we saw another light exactly like the first.  Size, brightness, speed, direction, apparent altitude, everything was just like the first, except this one was a little more to the South.  This light also disappeared over the horizon to the Northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some time after, about 11:15 or so, we were all glancing up at the stars.  I then saw a flash as well, which was about the size of three or four stars combined.  It looked almost like a camera flash.  It came from the same Southerly direction as the first flash at about 30 degrees in the sky.  Once again we don’t know if the two incidents are connected in any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a footnote, two of our car batteries died and had to get jump started.  One died just as it arrived at the campsite and one the morning after we arrived.  Both had died before we saw the lights.<n>

Its shape was unknown to me and my mother. It was traveling northwest, originally coming from over the Atlantic Ocean. No lights whatsoever were visible on the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It basically resembled a huge flat fish (ray); it had large and flat wings (one on each side) with very round and basic edges. As intriguing this object was, it still very much looked like an aircraft with two side wings, a distinctive front end and a back end including a wing. Certainly this object was large, but not incredibly massive – probably a bit larger than a commercial, transatlantic plane. The wings were distinctive from the body which looked like a cylinder. Also the wings were attached about halfway on the body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest part was the motion of this object. It moved upward by rotating on itself at a fairly slow and steady speed (about 5 sec. to rotate on itself). The object never appeared to fly downward and moved up at a slow rate (similar to a small commercial plane) - I and my mother were able to see it for many minutes from the front and back of our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A fairly quite noise was possibly heard early when we first witnessed the object at low altitude and a certain aura/haze was present at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, a large cluster of clouds made the object disappear from our vision, but it disappeared steadily and not abruptly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that a commercial plane was flying in the opposite direction (Southeast) during the last minute of the sight at a very similar altitude. It could not have been further than 3 miles from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Our home overlooks a large portion of the valley below and we have fewer glares than homes below us.  I think that really made the difference in this sighting.  I was helping my nine year old get ready for bed this evening, at approximately 8:50 p.m.  I went into our 2nd story loft to open a window, and due to the pretty view, I peeked out through one of the windows.  I noticed a strange flashing object hovering over what seemed to be roughly over the Promenade Mall in Temecula, or maybe south a mile or two, over the power lines off of Route 79 south.  The object was not moving, and I watched it for at least 10 minutes to see if would reveal itself to be a helicopter, or plane.  It just stayed in the area. It was barely moving around, except for the spinning motion, going clockwise.  It could easily see white spinning lights, turning blue, then back to white, and then red and then to white again.  It seemed to wobble a few times, but remained over the area without moving away.  I had to step away to tuck my daughter into bed, and when I got back it was still there.  I grabbed my telescope and ran downstairs, but when I went to the front door, the house across the street was blocking my view.  I ran to the garage and tried to find it, but the same house blocked the view.  I went back upstairs, frustrated, and found it in the sky, but it had moved about 2 inches to the right, from my viewpoint.  Then, it flashed like a camera flash, and then I saw a yellow streak fly across the sky, moving upwards at an angle of about 45 degrees.  I remember thinking it looked like a comet in reverse.  The streak was gone in an instant.  This whole process took 20 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Coming out of the front door of my unit at an apartment-converted-condominium building, the lawn was surrounded by the building in a box-like fashion, with an exception of the south side fully open where the parking lot was.  I walked toward the parking lot, into the opening, and to my right, I spotted a bright red light in the sky, above the trees.  I looked directly at it, and the red light softly throbbed, like a beacon light.  From my vantage point, to the left of the red light were three bright white lights flashing in a rapid succession.  The red light would lit up and fade, then three rapid white flashes from right to left, then back to the red light lighting up.  It’d repeat the process.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could tell that they were lights on an object, but I could not see the shape of the object.  At first, I thought it must be an airplane or a helicopter, so I waited for it to come closer in hope of a better inspection of what it was. Then I realized that it wasn’t either flying towards me or going the opposite direction.  It just remained stationary with the lights throbbing and flashing.  I also realized that the lights were unusually bright: the red light was just too noticeable and the white flashes were sparkling bright – similar to a camera flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it was moving, it was done at a barely noticeable pace.  So slow that I was unsure if it was moving or remaining stationary.  For the most part, it remained stationary.  It remained virtually motionless for 10 good long minutes.  Finally, it moved further from me until I could no longer see it due to the trees being in the way.  The way it moved, it moved very smoothly; in a gliding motion.  There was no sign of the object turning as it moved away; the lights remaining in their same positions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this before.  I would like to find whether that was an UFO or something else that can be explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was light rain, no moon; it was a dark night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed just west and south of me, at what appeared to be at high altitude, a string of about 30 amber lights in a perfect straight line.  I temporarily lost sight of these as I negotiated the winding road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I next saw them they now appeared to be decending at a steep angle and had now broken the formation.It now looked like a comet with a tail which was both curved and V shaped.  It was still composed of individual amber lights. It looked as if it would crash.  Again I lost sight of it for a moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When next I saw it, it had again changed shape.It now looked like a double V one behind the other.  I must emphasize that I accually did not see motion.  These were, so to speak, snapshots as my attention had to be redirected to driving on this wet mountain road.  But the position of these objects was changing as was my own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I last observed these objects, they were now still south of me but behind me.  Their shape now appeared to be a single V, only now one arm of the V was longer than the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time elapsed 2-3 minutes.<n>

We were heading west towards the park entrance, my friend was ahead of me.  We were going back to where he thought he dropped his cell phone earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking, I was looking up at the sky noticing how nice the stars looked, trying to pick out constellations.  After about a minute of star gazing I observed to what at first to be a bright, yellow in color, meteor streaming across the sky.  But while looking at the object I noticed there was no trail behind, I also saw that within the yellow glow that there was a very distinct disk shaped craft with a darker center (very solid looking).  I only observed it for about one to one and a half seconds max.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to stop, or rapidly slow down, at one point in midflight, (for a mille second) and continue its flight at the same rate of speed, maybe around 100,000mph.  I observed it flying at an altitude of 400-500 ft., moving silently, no noise at all , traveling in a straight path from the SSE towards the NNW.  I estimated its size to be about 250ft across. In the time I saw the object it appeared to clear about 30-50 miles (within 1-1.5 sec.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately neither my friend, who was searching for his phone, nor the bum in the park could confirm my sighting, to my knowledge I am the only person who had seen the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a custodian with the Pittsburgh Public Schools, a very &#34;normal&#34; person.  What I saw that night left me frozen in shock, I couldn’t move or speak, I even cried a bit (could have been due to my eyes being wide open from the experience). What I saw was real, I don’t know what it was but it was there.<n>

It was the same hue of orange as the sodium vapor street lights used in Honolulu, but larger, and much brighter. I thought maybe it was a reflection of the street lights, but after changing my viewing angle in the car several times I confirmed it was not a reflection. It was much higher than the ridge, so it was not a street light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend was in the passenger seat, and asked what I was looking at. I said, &#34;that orange light in the sky.&#34; And she replied, &#34;oh the one that just split into two?&#34;  Indeed, it had split into two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed to be hovering. I couldn&#39;t judge the size of the lights, since I couldn&#39;t determine how close or far they were. They then merged back into one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light blinked on and off several times, then disappeared altogether. There were no clouds in the sky at the time, and winds were calm.<n>

The seen 2 fast moving lights move from above my head to the north then disappear out of sight. They had a slight orange glow to them. They were fairly small in size though. stayed close together but near the end separated in almost unity at the same speed then from what my friend and I remember moved back together then vanished. The lights took about 8 seconds to go from straight above our heads till out of site in the far distance. Way too fast for birds and too consistent to be birds also. Very spooky though. Seen similar traveling lights same time exactly one year ago just a park over so very interesting it happened again. This time they were more orange then a dim glowing white color. also last year the lights went on for about 20 minutes in different formations (some in 2&#39;s, some in V&#39;s).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a bolt of lighting come across the sky from west to east.  In its path the lighting hit an unidentified object that had no lights or markers on it.  The lighting did not continue across the sky, it went straight down after hitting this object.  the object looked to be a circular long object.  The object was a mile or two away at the point of impact.  It moved across the sky faster than a plane and as light as a feather.  It looked as though this object was slowly declining out of the sky.  It was a neon yellow glowing haze/aura/light after the lighting hit it.  It was just at the lower level of the cloud line(Few thousand feet).  As it passed directly over my head it made no sound at all.  At this point there was no thunder or rain to dampen the sound of a plane.  Several minutes after the object had passed a plane had flown by at a similar level and not directly over my head, and it made normal airplane noise.  The plane had several lights on it(like the F.A.A. requires), as the U.F.O. only had one light that glowed on and almost off but still bright enough to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible overflight of the ISS.

It started from the northwest and it traveled to the southeast. It was going pretty fast so i didn&#39;t have a lot of time to look at it but I looked at the lights and I could see three yellow on the bottom and three on each corner of the triange. That made it stand out that it looked like a triangle. We live right next to the airport so i thought it was a plane but it was going way too fast and it made no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness Two:  I saw the same thing only I ddin&#39;t see the shape, I just saw red and yellow lights and it was going too fast to be a plane and too quiet to be a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness Three: I saw red and yellow lights on a triangle shaped thing.

It moved steadily west and then suddenly stopped, then it continued west before zig zagging violently and disappearing. I live near Selfridge ANG Base and have never seen a plane manuever like that, furthermore the light had a strange glow to it and seemed to be hovering, i.e. changing elevation. If I had to estimate I would say the light was a few miles south of my location, which was at the intersection of M-53 and M-59.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/25/08 21:00|Newtown Square|PA|Other|8 seconds (roughly)|May 25, 2008 (9:30 pm) translucent football cuts through cloud layer, no lights.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63534.html|73|ndxe200805| May 25, 2008 (9:30 pm) translucent football cuts through cloud layer, no lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this for my girlfriend. This is the second sighting she has witnessed in the Newtown Square area. She is an excellent observer. I was on the phone with her during the time it happened. It was around 9:30 pm to be exact. Looking due south she observed the thin cloud layer being parted at a high rate of speed. She tells me that the object itself looks football shaped from her vantage point and it was translucent like a frosted glass. She could make out the dark sky through it but could see enough of the object to see it was there. It was moving twice the speed of a commercial jet liner. It was cutting the clouds until she could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, her first sighting was much more dramatic than this one. I was at work and she called me very scared from inside our parked car behind the apartment complex (same area from which she saw this recent one). She told me she just saw a UFO. The object was literally in town. Newtown Square is about a 40 minute drive from Philly&#39;s edge. Pike&#39;s (or major streets) run away from the metropolitan area in a grid (somewhat). West Chester Pike links outside Philly to West Chester, PA. So it&#39;s a pretty well travelled road even early in the morning. This is why it&#39;s a wonder that this craft would make itself so apparent. The obect was seen (my guess) about a football field away from where she was. Nothing blocked her sight of it. It was about 3 am and she was watching the dog in the back yard. The back yard consists of a parking lot for tenants and a grass area that runs up to a fence. Standing on the egde of the grass looking towards the south the lights of the object caught her eye. She said it may have come from overhead, it was travelling east and slowed down over the town and descended perhaps half of a football field and hovered over the top of a bank that sits on an intersection in town. The underside of the object was lit up from the sulphur street lights but since cloud coverage was so low, the street light bounced back down and slightly lit the top of the craft up as well. It was egg shaped and possibly a white to off-white color because of the way the light lit it up. There were two sets of rotating lights that were possibly around the entire vehicle. One set(row) was on the bottom and one(row) was towards the top. She says that from what she could see of the craft there were four lights visible in each row, whether the lights went all the way around the craft, she didn&#39;t know. The lights looked as if they were pulsing in patterns counterclockwise around the object? That&#39;s assuming the lights went all the way around it. She says the object hovered there for 15 to 20 seconds then moved behind ! some tre es. At that point she jumped into our car with the dog and locked the doors until she could calm down (which took some time) and then fled back into the apartment. That&#39;s when she called me to report her sighting. This happened last February &#39;07.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we looked forward into the sky, one of us noticed a white, cigar or tampon shaped object sitting in the sky, no wings, obviously not a plane or helicopter, and there was no smoke or jetstream coming from the object.  It was probably about 500 yards or so away in the sky.  We sat stunned, asking each other, &#34; what could that possibly be, besides a UFO.&#34; No one wanted to tee off, because we wanted to wait to see what happened with the foreign craft.  After about 2 minutes, the craft gradually got smaller for about 10 seconds, and then completely disapppeared like it went into stealth mode, again, no smoke or anything, it just vanished. Within minutes of seeing the craft, a small army type plane was flying in the same general area where we had seen the craft.  We kept looking for the next two hours of golf, but no reappearance occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

A black/dark grey round something appeared above the cemetery fairly high in the sky, changing it&#39;s axis and then steadied itself parallel to the ground and moved at a constant rate (fairly fast) and in a straight line north until it was out of sight.  We thought it was a bird but there was no flapping and it was faster than a bird, and a round, disc.  We don&#39;t know what it was, it wasn&#39;t a balloon because it didn&#39;t continue to go higher, and it didn&#39;t adjust it&#39;s speed to the wind, fast then slow or vary in direction like a balloon or kite.  I would say it was about 2500-3000 feet in altitude; I don&#39;t know what it was, just what it wasn&#39;t.  It was not silver, had no lights, no &#34;crest&#34; or hump shape in the center that we could see, but then we were not looking at it horizontally, but at an upward diagonal direction.  I would be interested if anyone else saw it.  One airplane jet passed shortly after, &lt;3 minutes later, not in pursuit though, but across it&#39;s flight path, after it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They looked like balloons, but they did not move across the sky*. I observed the two balloons together again......They stayed in awkward rotation movement, but did not move in any direction. Then suddenly they detached from each other slowly and seemingly with purpose. They moved away from each other, Both rotated awkwardly in unison shortly...then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> * During this observation, it was noticeably windy.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My backyard has a big hill and I was laying on my back admiring the blue sky, may I remind you there was NOT a cloud in sight.  I closed my eyes for a few moments, and when I opened them, there was a black disk hovering (I estimate) 1500 meters above my house. I remember just sitting there and thinking &amp;quot;what the heck is that?!&amp;quot;  The most confusing thing was I hadn&#39;t seen ANYTHING in the sky prior to that. It didn&#39;t make a noise as I continued gazing at it in awe.  Now, I have always been interested in aliens and outerspace since I was about 5, so I ran inside my house (which was about 10 meters away) grabbed my camcorder, and sprinted back outside.  To my amazment, the mysterious disk was gone,  NO WHERE in sight.  I ran to the front yard and looked around the clear blue sky, not a thing in sight. No noises, either.  That was the day I became a true believer of UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The rest of the craft was a silvery metalic color. There were no wings or anything on it. it was going very slow moving,just hovering over the trees. we only saw it for about 20 seconds,then it disapeared into the trees. the craft did not have a sond or anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

There was no sound and the object was traveling at a very high speed. It appeared to be only a couple of thousand feet above us. It quickly flew east towards the city of Victoria BC and then we lost sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Easter Standard Time on May 24th I looked out my window and saw a strange light flashing in the sky. I went outside to get a better view and what I saw was a bright flashing light that was not moving but hovering quietly. It began flashing blue lights and it flashed them in sequences. It would flash a light every second for three seconds and at the third second count it would hold for a longer period of time become very bright and then dim away for a few seconds before starting again. It then seemed to turn and move up and to the left. It stayed in that place and continued blinking and then it would seem to go far away and then appear again. I ruled out any chance of it being a star or an aircraft and after doing this and moving quickly to different positions it stopped completely and went out of sight. My neighbor looked at it and also saw it. A few minutes after it went away it seemed to appear one more time and as it blinked it’s lights you could see the outline of a dark circular shape around it in which the lights were reflecting off of it. It was truly mind-boggling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/24/08 21:40|Ventura|CA|Chevron|15 minutes|four illuminated chevrons that appeared to be made up of several pieces - similar to birds flying together. Ventura, CA|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63521.html|86|ndxe200805| four illuminated chevrons that appeared to be made up of several pieces - similar to birds flying together. Ventura, CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> First witness statement This began at approximately 9:40 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting with my husband in our hot tub and happened to glance to the sky.  I did not look directly up, but just raised my eyes slightly and looked toward the Northeast.  I noticed a chevron-shape flying across the sky.  I thought it was birds because of the formation, and because it looked like there were independent objects creating the formation.  But it was dark outside…and unless they were iridescent birds that happened to be getting a reflection from the moon, I don’t know how they would be lit up.  I said to my husband, “What is that?  Birds, or a UFO?”  I said it very casually, because I really didn’t know WHAT I was seeing.  He said, “Maybe it’s a B2 bomber running a test,” (as we have military bases around and sometimes do see this type of thing.  But we didn’t really see lights, just simply illumination.  Then, he said that it was moving much too quickly to be an aircraft.  A few seconds later, while we were still wondering what we saw, there was another one.  This was appeared to fly in the same flight path of the first, but its shape was slightly different.  It was more of a flattened chevron, while the first was a very triangular shape.  These both flew in the direction from the West to the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within what seemed like a minute, but I don’t know for sure as there is not a lighted clock outside, a helicopter flew by.  The helicopter also looked like it was flying in the same flight path, although it may have been lower.  It was definitely slower and noisy, whereas the first two objects were silent.  About eight minutes later, we saw another one.  This one looked farther away to me, and it flew from the Northeast toward the Southwest.  This one seemed more like the first in its shape.  We saw this one for what seemed like a longer time – maybe a total of 15-20 seconds.  Approximately five minutes after that, we saw another one.  This one also flew from the West to the East and we were able to see it for about 12-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were staring at the sky trying to figure out what we saw, or see more, or who knows what, we saw several regular aircraft.  They all moved a lot slower than what we saw.  We also saw some satellites that appeared to be moving fairly quickly.  However, because of their blinking, it is hard to determine how fast they were moving compared to blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second witness statement: On the night of May 24, 2008 at approximately 9:40 pm, my wife and I were relaxing in our hot tub, looking up at the sky in Ventura, CA.  Suddenly, my wife said, &#34;What is that?&#34; and I looked up and saw a chevron shaped &#39;thing&#39; flying through the sky. We live near the coast in Southern California, so the &#39;thing&#39; was coming from the ocean, moving west to east. It was moving very quickly, faster than conventional aircraft that we see regularly in our area. The &#39;thing&#39; was in the shape of a &#39;V&#39;, or a chevron and was made up of single lights or dots, probably 8 in total.  About a minute after seeing the object, another identical object moved across the sky in the same direction, following the direction of the first object.  It looked identical and was moving along the same direction. We heard no sound and saw no conventional contrails from aircraft which appear to be at a similar altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 5 minutes later, we both saw another identical object moving across the sky from the North to the South.  It appeared to be the same shape and moving the same speed as the previous &#39;things.&#39;    We sat and pondered what the objects were for approximately 10 minutes when another &#39;thing&#39; flew through the sky along the same path and at the same rate as the first and second &#39;things.  We continued to look into the sky for an additional 15 minutes or so and did not see anything else that resembled the first sighting.  The objects appeared to be moving at a higher rate of speed than conventional aircraft, and were completely silent in their movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Before the stars started to come out, I was laying on the ground watching the sky when a saw a bright spot.  I assumed it was a planet, so I spun my telescope over to spot what it was.  It seemed to bright and too early.  At first I wasn’t even sure it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the eyepiece I saw a sphere, fairly bright, and neutral colored glow.  I though something was wrong with the lens because there was something that looked like a long string extending from it, with a glowing reddish light on the end, it looked like there may have been a light where it connected also.  The string seemed to swing back and forth on the bottom of the sphere as I watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object moved across the sky for about 10 minutes from about the South and West a bit, heading north.  I estimate it only crossed about 15-20 degrees of sky before it vanished.  It’s path wasn’t consistent with a pass over of the International Space Station that same night, so I’m unsure if this was some other sort of object, maybe a satellite or weather device.  I doubt the object is of any importance; I just have not been able to find any other astronomical reports fitting the description of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were moving Westerly and totally silent.  They then shifted to the North, and each V formation seem to dim out one by one, then the last trailing light followed and eventually went out also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were about 30 Germans, who all saw the same thing as I, and none of them believe it was anything but Balloons.  I do not believe you can put balloons in the night sky like that and they stay in perfect formation as they float away.  I am convinced, they were not balloons.

5/24/08 11:20|Longmont|CO|Other|30 seconds|Daylight sighting of two small objects at altitude moving against the wind.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63555.html|89|ndxe200805| Daylight sighting of two small objects at altitude moving against the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday morning, May 24th, 2008 I was attending the Silver Creek High School graduation ceremony in Longmont, Colorado.  It was being held outdoors on the football field with the audience facing west, toward the Front Range of the Rockies.  The morning was sunny with a very clear blue sky and a few scattered clouds, surprising since just two days earlier an unusual mile-wide tornado hit in nearby Windsor, CO and Friday had heavy thunderstorms throughout the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the speeches portion of the ceremony  I watched a Twin Otter skydiver jump plane climb out of Longmont Airport about a mile and a half north of the graduation location.  Within less than 10 minutes the aircraft climbed to over 12,000 ft. and I observed seven jumpers as tiny dots freefall from the aircraft and open their chutes about 2,000 feet above the airfield.  I watched as they manuvered their very colorful chutes as they descended until they drifted out of sight below buildings in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The recitation of the name of graduates and the handing out of diplomas took quite some time as there were over 200 graduates.  During the hour long process the Twin Otter returned to Longmont Muni and picked up another load and climbed out again for another jump run.  At about 11:20 am as it made its high altitude pass over the airport I watched for the jumpers.  I saw one small dot exit the airplane and looked for more jumpers since they are hard to see initially at such altitude.  As I scanned the sky I spotted two more dots lower than the first one I saw.  I assumed they were also jumpers and I watched them for the deployment of the their chutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the two dots, which looked identical to each other with white and dark markings, I realized they were not dropping but moving sideways at 3 to 4 thousand feet above the ground.  My thought was they were gliding in freefall, but as I continued to watch them they were moving further west, away from the airport drop zone.  Maybe they were birds I thought as they moved in relationship to one another, but no wings or flapping were evident.  I pointed them out to my 21 year old son seated next to me and asked what he thought they were.  As we continued to watch, it was clear they were not descending but moving further and further to the west, directly into the very brisk wind that morning.  At one point they maneuvered very close to each other, then apart again.  These two dots continue west toward the mountains and twice near the end, before they were lost to our vision due to distance, they turned and we each saw a glint of sunlight off of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we don&#39;t know what they were.  Obviously not jumpers, unless they had some special flying suit, but they moved several miles west and we never saw any chutes, plus they were in the air too long to be in any kind of free fall.  They could not have been birds due to the speed they were moving which appeared to be greater than 60 mph horizontally, and the metallic glint of sunlight from both of them in the distance does not occur with birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a pilot of both fixed wing and helicopters with 40 years of experience, I did not recognize them as any conventional aircraft.  There was no real discernible shape other than just a dot, as a jumper would appear in free fall, yet they moved independent of one another but continuously in the same direction, never more than about 500 feet apart, but sometimes closer. We watched for about 20 or 30 seconds until they disappeared in the distance.  I know these were not birds or waterfowl, due to the speed and lack of any wings.  Additionally ducks or geese will fly in tight formation to conserve energy and these were moving all about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without any logical explanation of what these two items were, I can only call them a pair of true un-indentified flying objects.<n>

The light in front was bright and the other a little dimmer. The size of the lights were alittle larger than the brightest star. The lights were very sharp and clear. They were whitish in color. The dimmer light appeared to follow the brighter one. The distance between the lights would be about an inch if i held my hand out and covered the lights with my fingers.

I am writing to ask, did anyone report or comment on, seeing anything unusual, in the sky, Friday night (5/23), around 11:00pm?  My husband and I witnessed a bright orange circular object, at first hovering then traveling toward us, from the south skies over Simi. While watching we both noticed the object released a smaller light (maybe ambers) that dropped toward the earth, into the hills to the South of Simi. Of course it could have been further away. Then the object came toward us, closer, becoming larger the closer it got. When it seemed to be over LA Ave, it suddenly turned West and picked up speed. It did not pulse, it did not change color but it did become what looked like two round lights. I thought it might be a fireball, or comet but my husband said it looked like two perfectly round lights, like headlights of a car, only in the sky and orange.  We have a pair of very strong binoculars and could see this object close up. All we could see were the lights.  Two of them staying proportionally together during the entire event. My question is, did anyone else, that you know of, report seeing this?  This event lasted 10-15 minutes.  Surely someone else had to of seen this!<n>

I did not have a camera on me and didn&#39;t run to go get one. Looked to be heading towards Saint Linus Church and have to of gone over it and it was close to cicero but was atleast a block and a half away from cicero. The object made no sound. If a Chupacabra travels I think this is the way they do travel in a very small black egg size craft. Unless it was really a balloon. It look to be atleast 400 feet High in the air. I see alot of things and report alot and say what I think. Why, I say this is I saw a something that could of have been a Chupacabra.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We were facing due south and the sky was clear and the Moon and Mars were brightly visible. Suddenly a bright light appeared in the sky, about a palms width east of the Moon and Mars. It was traveling slowly in a easterly direction. I could barely make out a saucer shape on the rt. side of the light. The light was about one and a half times the brightness of the moon. Suddenly the object took off so fast that it appeared to wink out. It was a very quiet night and there was no sound of any aircraft at the time. My wife is a RN and I am a retired Police Officer. I am 65 and this is not the first time we have witnessed a unexplained sighting. This one was not very dramatic compared to what I&#39;ve seen before. Just curious if anyone else might have reported something that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/23/08 02:00|Chelsea|MI|Formation|5 minutes|Four lights in a row, evenly distanced apart – maybe a foot or less, in a straight line (relative to each other), that was on a slight|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65244.html|103|ndxe200805| A thunderstorm approaching in the middle of the night/early morning woke me up, and I got out of bed, went to the window and looked out.  I live in a two-storey house, my bedroom is on the second floor.  The window from which I looked out is on the east side of the house.  I live on a tree-lined street (maples, sycamores).  There’s one street light on the corner west of my house, and another street light further up the street going toward Main Street (which runs north/south), which is not visible from my house.  When I looked out the window I could see the silhouette of the maple tree next door, and saw that the wind had picked up.  I heard thunder in the distance, but there was no rain.  I stood there at the window for at least 2 or 3 minutes watching for lightning, and after not seeing any I thought I should get back into bed and try to go back to sleep.  But immediately after thinking that, and before I left the window, a bright white, round light caught my eye.  At first I thought it was a firefly, but the light was too large, bright and distinct.  It was just slightly above my eye level, and being that I was on the second floor the light was up near the top of the maple tree that grows in front of the house next door to me (on the east side).  I would say it was approximately 20 feet away from my window.  It was perfectly round, about the size of a tennis ball.  Another one slowly appeared next to the first, and then another, and another – until there were four lights in a row, evenly distanced apart – maybe a foot or less, in a straight line (relative to each other), that was on a slight 20 degree angle – the most distant light slightly higher than the first in the row.  There was no sound, except for a light wind.  These lights hovered near the top of the tree and maintained this linear formation for at least 30 seconds. I don&#39;t know if they were individual lights, joining each other; or perhaps they were attached to something else that had slowly moved from behind the tree.  Then! they we re suddenly gone, almost like I blinked and they were gone.  I don’t know what they were, but I do know they weren’t fire flies or street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The exact size of the object was indeterminate, but it seemed visible through light cloud cover and light pollution over old rt. 66, specifically 7th street Wal-mart. It faded from view before it fell much further, it may have also been moving westward at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After it&#39;s descent, it took approx. 20 seconds for the 2nd light to disappear, and when it did, it did not appear to change in size, it just disappeared. The 2nd light remained, but it was now 2 smaller amber lights, instead of 1 large light. This light remained still, for 2 minutes before heading north, and ultimately out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had only driven a few hundred yards when I noticed a very bright white light off in the horizon, north east of my car.  At first I didn&#39;t think anything of it, assuming it was  some kind of airplane tower or something of that sort. After a few moments I started to notice that whatever this thing was had not one bright light but three lights and was starting to move in my direction. It took a second for me to realize that it wasn&#39;t anything I had ever seen before! The only thing that I could think of was to get some kind of footage of this object. I pulled my car to the shoulder of the road and as I did so I noticed two other cars  on the opposite side of the highway do the same thing. One of the persons got out of their car while the other remained inside theirs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat in complete astonishment that this was actually happening as the object glided toward the ground at my car. It traveled the distance from the horizon to above my car so fast I didn&#39;t even have time to blink! I watched as this now quite visible equilateral triangle (with a semi-circle cut out in the back) flew a matter of 10 to 15 feet above my car.  The object must have been about twice as long and twice as wide as my car and emitted no sound but had three lights on the bottom,  one in each corner of the triangle. The lights seemed to be streaming down like strobe lights until it banked onto its side. When it did this, I got a clear view of the bottom and noticed that the lights were about the size of a dinner plate. That&#39;s when I got out of my car and grabbed my cell phone to try to shoot some footage of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as I found the video recorder on my phone and started recording, the object moved  over the trees and shot out of view in a south western direction. By  the time I gave up filming and looked around, one of the cars had already gone and the other was in the process of leaving. I have never experienced something like this in person before it was for a lack of a better term... bewildering!! I just wish I could have captured an image of it in time or been able to talk to the other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was amazed!!  The only thing visible was this round ball of light!  IF you held a penny at arms length above your head,...that was the size of this object!  It made no noise etc.  Just a solid white light.  IT wasn&#39;t the kind of light that flowed out on anything.  The only thing lit was the object. a solid pure white, very bright!  I watched this fly from overtop my head all the way until it passed over the mountain tops north-east from my house.  This object was i&#39;d say halfway between the ground and the height a airliner would fly.  I don&#39;t know the footage that would be, sorry.  It wasn&#39;t moving very fast, just a smooth staight path.  It wasn&#39;t as fast as a jet nor was it slow as a hot air balloon. what ever it was, it had to have some sort of propulsion system.  After it wasn&#39;t visible any longer a airliner flew over head in the south east direction and it looked like a ant compared to a mouse!! this thing had to be huge!!!   As i watched this, I felt at peace and amazed as if i was seeing history in the making!  Ever since this sighting i have been obsessed in ufology. and have seen a few more things around where i live but nothing quite the size of this!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You for your time.<n>

It was bright and stayed bright until the trees by my house blocked my view. There were no flashing lights like an airplane or helicopter. It just was bright. It traveled at a steady speed about that of a helicopter. There was no sound. At first I thought it might be a helicopter going to the hospital but it didn’t turn. It just went in a straight line. I didn’t have time to get my camcorder because I was trying to figure out just what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I ran inside to get my father or a camera or something but when I went back outside I saw it for a split second and it turned even brighter red and disappeared into the trees.

We were about 3 to 4 miles North of Highway 85 when my husband said, &#34;what the heck is that?&#34;  I looked to my left and noticed a bright, flashing light.  I was stunned by the light and initially thought it was some type of a light from the field we were driving by, but then it started moving and it was apparent it was no stationary light.  It was pretty low to the ground, only a bit above the tall trees in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flying, flashing light passed us on the left, I watched it fly out of sight which only took about 5 seconds.  It was moving at a really fast speed.  As I was watching the first flashing light move out of sight, I noticed a  second one passing us as well.  I watched it until it disappeared out of sight in about the same amount of time.  Both flying, flashing lights headed South in the direction of Highway 85.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I could see was the flashing light, that looked like a ball shape to me.  It is hard to put a size to them, but compared to the moon, they were a lot smaller and were both the same size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no sound from them, we however were driving in the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it and my husband and I were stunned after they flew by wondering what the heck these things could have been.<n>

My husband pointed out a satellite in the sky and just then I said oh my gosh look right above your head, when we looked up we saw a ball of bright light, lighter than anything we have ever seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the camera outside since my last sighting and I took pictures as it moved away from us to the east. It was probably around 2 miles up and it moved very slow and silent. I snapped 6 or 7 pictures which I am sending as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not turn out clear and look like lines in the sky. We used 800 speed film, no flash, on a Canon Rebel SLR 35 MM Camera. In picture one, if you blow it up you can actually see two separate lights and almost a shape, on picture two you can see a dark triangle shape. The light was very bright but did not give out light. It is very strange to explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are both believe in life on other planets as we have had sightings in the past. I believe we know the difference between satellites, stars, planes, helicopters, and unknown objects. We work full time, have no kids, and lead a very normal life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported a different sighting on April 16th so this is not my first time reporting.

I don&#39;t know of any plane that has a bright light shining down at all times, but maybe I&#39;m wrong.  It was a very bright light, and almost looked like a shooting star, but was much brighter and it kept going through the sky until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore. It was very clear last night, and you could see no trail whatsoever, and it was silent.  It almost had the characteristics of a comet, but the light was more of a bluish white. I really can&#39;t know for sure what it was, but I have watched the stars avidly since I was a child and I have never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

And happened to look up in the sky, almost directly above me a brilliant, bright, white light was moving across the sky from S.W to N.E.  Moving at a constant speed and direction.  I&#39;d estimate at an elevation of 30 to 35 thousand feet.  And I&#39;d estimate the speed to be around 200-300 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airplane had past North of the object heading West.  I could hear the engines fading away as I noticed the light moving basically in the opposite direction.  I kept my attention on the light, noting there was absolutely no sound coming from the object. This was definitely not a shooting star, there was no trail what-so-ever, and moving much too slow.  And I&#39;d rule out a satellite, this was closer, more like commercial airlines fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was clear directly over Mammoth Lakes tonight. The moon has already set, or hasn&#39;t risen yet.  I lost sight of the light approximately two minutes after noticing it, disappearing behind distant clouds N.E. of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Nothing out of the ordinary but then I noticed a white object zig zagging back and forth behind the jet, moving in and out of the contrail. If I had to guess at the distance behind the jet, it would have been about a few thousand feet to as little as a few hundred. The object would suddenly increase in speed and catch up to the jet almost then back off, all the while zig zagging. It would move as far away as several thousand feet out of the contrail on either side of it as well. Then the object appeared to enter the contrail and move straight toward the jet. You could see the clouds/contrail actually be distorted by the object. This went on until I could no longer see the jet or the object and could only barely make out the contrail. It&#39;s  a bright sunny day (not a single cloud in the sky) so it made it hard to see as it got further away. I was to the point of being concerned that the object was going to catch and run into the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m in a location that sees countless jets fly over during the day as they move out from atlanta to the northeast. I frequently can look up in the sky and see 8 or 10 of them at any given time but I have never seen anything like this.

It appeared to be white or silver or to be illuminating very bright light from within (very bright, not the way any secret object would appear).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped, I took off my sunglasses and shielded my eyes from the sun with my hand. (The object was sitting stationary for the first four to five minutes we watched) At that time a jet with an exhaust trail crossed between us and the object. The object for a moment disappeared on the other side of the jet&#39;s trail of smoky exhaust. After the exhaust trail drifted away, we saw that the round and bright stationary object was still there and remained still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat down on the trail at that point to watch closely, to take in every detail. I looked around at the many people playing at the park just ahead of us up the trail to see if they were looking at it, but none were. I stopped a joger who passed us at that time. He didn&#39;t even look up, but dismissivly said planes can look all kinds of ways in the sky, and kept on jogging.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, (and this is about four or five minutes after the initial sighting) the object started moving toward the east. I lost sight of it as it crossed nearly directly between the the sun and us. As it got further east we once again could see it. I called someone on my cell phone in an attempt to document the sighting. The person I called lives near by and could have video tapped it, but they were not home. It continued moving eastward and growing smaller in size as it was leaving. At that time another joger past whom I stopped and asked if he wanted to see something weird in the sky. He said he did so I pointed it out to him. He did see it before it disappeared, but it was much smaller by then, but still very bright. I told him it was almost gone. He commented that he could see it and that it was weird because it was so small and far away but was still bright, he thought it was unusual. But he didn&#39;t even see the the weird stuff I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It left our sight about six to eight minutes after the first view of it. I looked down at the little unusually intelligent three and half year old child who watched it with me and asked what he thought it was. He answered, &#34;Well, maybe a big magic white bowling ball?&#34; I do not know what it was and make no claims as to what it might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I&#39;m one to gaze at the stars and simply enjoy the night sky.  I sat looking at the stars and then it seemed as though one was moving kind of slowly across the sky.  This did not look like a plane because it almost looked like a &#34;bright star&#34; was moving slowly across the sky.  Then all of a sudden it seemed to &#34;turn&#34; torward me, and the only reason I say this &#39;light&#39; &#39;turned&#39; is because the light became a lot brighter and it looked almost like a huge spotlight was being turned rather quickly to an observer(me)...but the light not not shine far out.  It was just a very bright light that &#39;turned&#39; in a sense and sat for about 5 seconds and suddenly the object began to appear dimmer and dimmer.  It seemed like although the object was &#34;flying into space&#34; at a very rapid speed.  It simmed very quickly and soon the object was not visible, AT ALL.  The was no doubt a UFO front my perspective.  I watched it fly into space and away from the earth!  I could not believe this.  I would like to gain more information on what I saw and if there were any other witnesses in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a very clear night and we could see alot of stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then this object which was diamond shaped flew slowly directly over us.  It made no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took about 20 seconds to go from one tree horizon to the next.  We all agreed that it must have been atleast as big as a football field.

Out of the corner of my eye I noticed what appeared to be a bright off white light moving from south north east at a very slow rate of speed. I had to lean my head back for a moment as the object appeared nearly right over the top of my head. It made no noise, and travelled very slowly and silently for about a minute and a half, and suddenly, rapidly accelerated at speeds I could not identify with any other aircraft I have ever seen manuver before, due east directly above the tree line. At that point, startled, I ran into the house and woke my mother from a dead sleep to validate the peculiar object. We both proceeded outside to which we witnessed it move back and forth, up and down, changing in brightness, and at times what appeared even to be in shape for several minutes. There was extensive cloud cover on the horizon above the tree line, and enough overcast to create a haze over the ret of the objects in the sky, however this peticular object remained extremely vibrant. I then proceeded to go to my computer and check my online star charts on Worldwide Telescope for the current time and date while my mother stayed outside and observed its odd behavior. Nothing celestial even matched the intensity or positioning of this object. Note: I am an avid astronomer of over 8 years, fluent with many of the night sky&#39;s celestial content. Towards the end of the sighting I called the mufon hotline and reported the object as both my mother and I observed it... it later faded out, either disappearing, or moving behind cloud cover... and seemed to independently illuminate the clouds as it left from view. More importantly, this is the second time I viewed this object, and woke my mom to validate the first sighting I witnessed, but did not report nearly a week ago...<n>

It moved very slow from west to east and made no noise.  It was flying very close to the ground and we could determine this because it moved behind the trees nearby. It was too dark to make out what shape it was but we will never forget it.

I like to observe the occasional passing of satellites,  shooting stars and  night sky.  I live about 7 miles south east of Seguin, Texas a little out in the country in a small subdivision.  I saw at least two different satellites overhead going in different directions and one brief shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was facing South east towards Gonzales, Texas when I noticed low in the horizon barely over the tops of several mesquite trees in my front yard, SE corner, a shooting tail of light and then suddenly whatever was causing the light trail, tilted on its side and I could plainly make the object out that was making the light trail.  When it tilted there was no more trailing light from the object,  Upon tilting the object was a large glowing disc shaped object.  To be that large, it was probably a beam ship or mother ship (factoring the distance which could only be guessed at and the size of the disc).  Immediately after tilting on its side, it dematerialized or went to faster than the eye could see or something because after tilting and being clearly visiable as a disc on its side (glowing top or bottom towards me), it disappeared.  Again when it disappeared there was no light trail either.<n>

IT WAS A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT NOT PULSING OR BLINKING, JUST A BRIGHT LIGHT. IT MOVED RATHER SWIFTLY BUT NOT AS TO THINK IT WAS OTHER THAN A PLANE.  IT FLEW DIRECTLY OVER OUR HOME FROM THE SOUTHWEST HEADED IN AN NORTHEASTERN DIRECTION.  LIKE I SAID AT THE TIME WE THOUGHT IT TO BE A SMALL AIRCRAFT BUT WHEN IT FLEW OVER OUR HOME WE HEARD NO SOUND.  AT THE TIME THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY SO I DIDN&#39;T THINK THERE SHOULD BE ANY BUFFER TO THE NOISE THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MAKING.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE SECOND TIME WAS ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY MAY THE 24TH.  THIS TIME THE LIGHT, SAME COLOR AND AROUND THE SAME DISTANCE IN THE SKY  CAME FROM THE EAST. MY SON AND I WERE DRIVING HOME FROM THE GROCERY STORE AND WE SEEN IT FROM OUR VEHICLE.  WE WERE ONLY A 1/4 OF A MILE IF THAT FROM OUR HOME SO WE CALLED MY HUSBAND AND TOLD HIM TO GO OUT AND LOOK TO SEE IF HE COULD CATCH A GLIMPSE OF IT ALSO. AT THIS TIME WE HAD THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WITNESSED IT INITIALLY PLUS MY SON WHO IS 8. BY THE TIME WE GOT CLOSER TO OUR HOME THE LIGHT CHANGED DIRECTION AND STARTED TOWARD THE NORTH. ( I ALSO NEED TO INTERJECT THAT ON THIS NIGHT WE HAD THUNDERHEADS OVER US AND IT WAS REALLY LIGHTING. BUT THE LIGHT WAS BELOW THE CLOUDS AND ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE GROUND AS THE NIGHT BEFORE.) MY SON AND I LOST SIGHT OF THE LIGHT AS WE GOT CLOSER TO OUR HOME BUT MY HUSBAND AND FRIEND OF THE FAMILY SAID THEY COULD SEE IT FROM OUT BACK PORCH ONCE AGAIN, RIGHT OVER HEAD.  AT THIS TIME I CALLED MY HUSBAND BACK AND WHILE HE WAS ANSWERING HIS PHONE OUR FRIEND USED THE BINOCULARS TO GET A CLOSER LOOK.  HE SAID WHEN HE GOT THEM TO FOCUS ON THE LIGHT AND LOOKED THE LIGHT FLASHED GREEN AND SHOT OFF TO THE NORTH AT A FASTER SPEED, AND DISAPPEARED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ON OUR THIRD AND FINAL SIGHTING THE LIGHT CAME FROM THE WEST AND WAS HEADED IN AN EASTWARD DIRECTION, AGAIN MOVING ABOUT THE SAME SPEED AND THE SAME DISTANCE UP.   IT NEVER CHANGED COLOR, MOVED ANY FASTER OR HAD ANY SOUND BUT WAS SEEN BY TWO OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES THE ORIGINAL THREE OF US.

It was flying in a straight forward manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had no blinking lights it was just a contstant white  bright light.  As it got further away from us it seemed to dim down almost to nothing where you could barely see it anymore, but it still was not so  far away where you could not totally tell where it was.  We tracked the object for about 5 minutes before it dimmed down.  There were other vehicles were on the road at this time, but none of them stopped to watch.

We were driveing all day and thought it was time to camp out. As the night went on, and my grandparents went to bed me and my brother decided that we needed more wood for the fire because we were gettin cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we walked down the dirt road till we came to a highway.  Out of no where I look up and just hoovering over the tree tops is this Bright Red Orb, at frist i thought it was a fire work, but i noticed it didnt pop and it was to late for fireworks at a campsite, but when I seen it I paused and told my brother to look at it, we followed it with our eyes and it slowly hooverd over the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that very momment we both felt like time it self froze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it hoover up a little bit higher over the tree and for some strange way it look like it blasted off.  This might sound weird but it really looked like it hit hiper speed, like you see in movies.  But it really did,! and with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after we both seen it, we looked at each other and both were shocked and then cars started driveing down the high way, and even a guy on his bike rode past us.

We were playing basketball in the driveway of their house for about an hour, and people began to leave. We were about to go inside when I noticed an object moving through the sky. It looked like a large satellite, and it was moving at a constant speed. Being a pretty big ufo enthusiast myself, I pointed it out and we all started watching it. It soon started to make wobbles and turns that no satellite or aircraft could have made (it was way too high up to be a plane). I was wondering if it was my eyes playing tricks on me when it completely stopped in the middle of the sky. It hovered in one spot for about 40 seconds, and in that time it grew extremely bright. At that point we all knew it was no satellite we were looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object started moving again and flew into the distance. There were 5 of us watching it by now, and we called another person who lived down the block to come outside and see what was going on. We soon saw another object in the sky, and very faint, smaller dots appeared around it. The dots shot off in different directions, some moving extremely fast and some slower. One big dot stayed stationary. As we watched these dots (especially the big one) they began to change colors and it almost looked like they would split into 2 dots and then reassemble. One of the people I was with saw a red object leave the biggest dot and shoot towards the ground. All of us saw very faint shooting star-like objects flying by the area of the biggest dot. A HUGE orange object soon flew through a small area of the sky in a very shooting star-like motion, and we all saw it. At this point there were six of us and we decided to get in the car and drive about a half mile away to a place where there was less light and more open space to watch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We relocated to a parking lot with a field next to it, and we watched the objects that were still in the air. We saw some movement but not as much as before. We noticed that in the far corners of the sky there were flashing dots. Pretty much every direction you turned you were able to see something in the sky. Then, the big one. My friend went around to the other side of the building we were parked by to pee. He saw something in the sky and called all of us over. It was an object hovering in the air with extremely unusual lights. This one was much, much closer than any of the other things we had seen, and was actually only about a hundred feet from the ground from what it looked like. We ran over and watched it as it started moving one way, completely changed directions, and then completely turned around again. It flashed extremely brightly at least 3 times and then began to display very different patterns of lights. It almost could have been mistaken for a plane&#39;s lights at one point, but the lights kept changing and the object was moving very strangely. It disappeared over the treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this object we saw 3-4 plane-like objects move overhead, about 5 minutes apart from each other. They all came from the same direction, all were silent, and all of them headed in the same direction towards the first object we saw. They had blinking white and red lights on them but the amount of lights and the speed they were traveling was unusual. Me and a friend saw one final object, WITH blinking red and white lights, fly in the same direction. We thought it could be a plane but I watched it carefully just in case. When it passed where we were standing it began to move up and down as it was flying, making weird movements that planes do not make. Overall the entire experience lasted about 2-2 1/2 hours. These were definite UFOs, we all saw them. It was like absolutely nothing I have ever seen before, and the same goes for the 5 credible witnesses I was with. I&#39;m sure other people saw these also, as some of these objects were not subtle at all. Again, these objects moved in ways planes cannot, in erratic, jerky movements. However, they were definitely under some kind of intelligent control, as some seemed to interact with each other. Each of the 5 people I was with will tell the exact same story if asked, and we all saw what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/19/08 21:30|Irvine|CA|Circle|10 mins|Blue/White Circular UFO near UC Irvine's Mesa Court at 9:30 p.m. on 5/19/08|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63318.html|138|ndxe200805| Blue/White Circular UFO near UC Irvine&#39;s Mesa Court at 9:30 p.m. on 5/19/08<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a student at UC Irvine living in the Mesa Court Undergraduate Housing near the intersection of Campus and University Ave. I reported about a similar, if not the same UFO that I had witnessed 11 days ago flying in the exact same place as tonight. I was in my dorm room on the third floor which faces Parking Lot 5, when I heard the same sound that I had heard a week and a half prior coming from the UFO. Again it sounded similar to that of a toy plane, but I think it’s buzz is a little bit higher pitched than a toy plane. I looked out of my window and there it was, the UFO outlined with blue lights, flying closer to my housing community. I ran outside, this time determined to get a video of it, but when I went outside, I realized that I wasn’t wearing my glasses so it just looked like a small thin line of blurry blue lights. So I ran back up to my room, grabbed my glasses, and ran back outside. I could see it clearly now, flying overhead like last time, in what seemed like the direction of the 405 freeway. I ran towards the parking lot so that I could get a better video of it, but unfortunately, all that my video camera was able to pick up was a spot of blue light. There were other students in the parking lot also. There were a couple of guys by their car, one of them I heard saying to his friend, “It’s a UFO, it has to be.” After all, it was in plain sight, flying fairly low to the ground, probably no higher than one of those privately owned propeller planes that I see a lot of flying around Irvine. I’ve read other UFO reports from people who have seen them near the UC Irvine campus and it seems like there are two common sightings: one has blue lights and the other has white lights. From my dorm room, as well as when I saw it without my glasses, it looked like it had blue lights. But when I got a closer look in the parking lot, it seemed to have white lights. Maybe the lights look different depending on how close you are. But the lights themselves looked slightly different this time; t! hey didn ’t necessarily look like clean rectangles that outlined the sides like last time, instead they seemed to have an edge, sort of like a cross between circles and triangles, that outlined the edge. And there seemed to be some sort of a flickering light underneath, within its circular shape that flickered every now and then. It stayed flying in the same place for about ten minutes, flying at different angles as well as hovering in place for a few seconds at one point. I also saw a helicopter that seemed to be flying towards its direction. After a few minutes, I ran to another spot near the parking lot to hopefully get a better quality video of it but a few seconds after I got there, it slowly started flying away behind the trees and apartments and disappeared from my sight. There were another couple of guys in the parking lot who obviously saw it. One of them was waiting in the parking lot while his friend ran across the street when there were no cars coming and tried to run up the hill where the apartments are located to see where it was going. I doubt he was able to locate where it had gone because he came back a couple minutes later looking a little disappointed; so was I that I couldn’t get a better video of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After reaching the highest part of the road before 165 (a bit before Jelly Belly factory) I saw a silver or very shiny object in the sky directly over the road.  It appeared to be maybe 1-3 miles away and maybe 1000 feet in the sky.  The object was sort of egg shaped as it wasn’t quite round.  It sat stationary in the sky.  At first I thought it must be a plane or something else and that it didn’t appear to be moving because I was in motion.  I watched it stay in the same spot up to when I reached 165 and turned west.  I slowed down to a complete stop at the yield and observed the object continue to sit stationary over the road.  I looked back at the road and switched lanes, to the left lane, before the south entrance to Jelly Belly and looked south again and it was still there.  I began to ascend the hill the overpasses the railroad tracks before 80th Ave and looked back again and it was still there.  I then focused on reaching the apex of the hill hoping for a very clear view and when I turned to look it was gone.  I thought maybe it had moved so I kept looking in every direction and could not see it.  I turned south on 80th Ave hoping to catch another glimpse of it but it was gone.  I then continued on my way to work like any other day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I fly gliders in Surry and surrounding counties and am familiar with aircraft in the area.  The Coast Guard (not Ft Eustis - Army) provide security with helicopters for the nuclear plant.  Just after 9/11 they would land at night, with permission, at our glider field that is only a few miles from the plant.  They could respond within moments of any threat to the plant yet not be detected before hand.  One of our glider club members is one of their pilots.  There is also a blimp factory on the Virginia / North Carolina border that often fly blimps in the area. (The Blackwater private mercenary intelligence company along with many other military black ops are in this region too) The blimps prefer calmer days and usually stay further south, but it isn&#39;t a requirement and could account for the hovering effect by flying into the wind to get back to their field upwind.  They normally don&#39;t fly that close to the eastern part of the area, along the James River, because it is a longer flight back. A strong s/w wind could blow them over there and their small engines would work hard to get them back to N. Carolina.  If they were there they may have been sightseeing over the James River.  Jamestown, Colonial Williamsburg, and the small Williamsburg airport are on the east side of James River and the airport could be used for an emergency landing if the blimp were in trouble.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the Jamestown, James City County side of the river where the witness was standing also is home to a very highly restricted military inteligence community / base, where they are known to test experimental spy craft.  Local pilots have witnessed small unmanned recon aircraft being flown over the base.  Pilot in the air away from the restricted airspace but close enough to see it.  I strongly suspect the witness saw one of the above explanations.  It could have been a very planned flight by the plant security, but I suspect it was a blimp, helicopter, possibly an off course military item, or maybe even a small airplane waiting to come in at the Williamsburg field.  There are very strict rules against flying near the nuclear plants.  Pilots are not supposed to &#34;loiter&#34; over them in an airplane.  Whatever that means.  If a blimp were blown over the plant by the wind it would be an embarrassment to the plant to admit nothing was done.  There is also some ultra light activity in the area.  It may have been unidentifiable to a distant viewer but to someone near it may have not been an unusual object to be seen in those skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and telephone number deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS WHO SUBMITTED ORIGINAL REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Response To So-Called Explanations Of Previous Sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am responding to Mr. ((name deleted)) &#34;explanation&#34; of what I saw on the 19th of May 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His statement that there is a blimp factory on the NC/VA border is patently false.

(This is a little more than hour from the time of this writing, so the memory is still fresh and vivid).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my bicycle riding east on the Colonial Parkway (James City County) when I spotted an object over the James River, moving from east to west at a very slow speed. At first I thought it may have been a kite because it was a very windy day (the winds were gusting out of the SW at 20-30mph) and people do come out and fly their kites from the beaches when the winds are good. But when I came to an open spot in the road unobstructed by trees I stopped to get a better look and decided it was much too large to be a kite. It is a about a mile across the channel to the Surry Station and what I saw appeared to be very near the station’s twin domes and it must have been at least as large as they are, and perhaps larger. Besides that the object was moving very slowly against the wind, left to right from my vantage point, and its upper surface caught the sunlight and reflected like a sheet of aluminum foil. Its underside was dark. Then I thought that it might be an advertising balloon or dirigible, but the shape did not seem right. This was definitely a flattened disk. And, because it was so windy it did not seem like a good day to take a blimp up. (And, with security so high these days it does not seem logical that anyone would be permitted to get that close to power station. I have seen military helicopters on training missions over the river, but even they keep a wide berth from the power plant.)  I have eliminated the possibility of helicopters and small aircraft because, as I say, this object was hovering/drifting and appeared to be making a very leisurely circuit of the power plant. I walked down to water’s edge to see if I could get a better look, but without binoculars I couldn’t make out any other useful details. I watched it like this for a good 15-20 minutes. In that time it completely circled the station, moving against the wind. It appeared to correct its angle at times, very slowly rocking up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then decided to hurry home, grab my binoculars and camera and see if I might get a better look. It took me about ten minutes to bike home from there and another fifteen to get back on the Parkway by car. But, by the time I returned to my original position the object was gone. I drove a few miles down the Parkway hoping that it might have drifted elsewhere, but the sky was empty except for a few white clouds. Now, I wish I had stayed until it left. It would have been interesting to see which way it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF THIS REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Response To So-Called Explanations Of Previous Sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am responding to Mr. ((name deleted)) &#34;explanation&#34; of what I saw on the 19th of May 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His statement that there is a blimp factory on the NC/VA border is patently false.

It now seems rather absurd to assume that what I saw had an extraterrestrial explanation. I am sure that I was mistaken. And, as so many helpful people have contacted me over the last 6 months telling me what it was that I saw, I am now inclined to believe that they are right and I am wrong. I can now see that the notion of alien visitation is laughable. It is clear to me that people three thousand miles from the scene of the sighting are more knowledgeable than I am. And, then there is Mr. Davenport, with his light touch and keen wit, who never met a man he couldn&#39;t browbeat or make to feel like a worthless toad. Such a breath of fresh air! A real credit to Ufology. After all, who am I to make such a preposterous claim? Six years in the Navy, a BS in environmental science, a Masters in climatology, wh, I hardly know how to tie my shoes! I am now convinced that what I saw was an advertising airship that had been blown off course, and just happened to find itself stuck in the vicinity of the nuke plant.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The park was an open field with many trees lining the border. The sky was still dark with a clear view of the stars. While viewing the stars, we noticed a very large bright light, slightly larger then a satellite, and its altitude was much higher then that of a plane. This &#34;light&#34; began to move from its position in the sky downwards, at about a 45 degree angle, with a significant speed. This object made abrupt quick movements as though it was shaking.   It would occasionally speed up, then slow down. It continued this pattern until it was almost directly above us, and we noted that it was not a plane. It was silent, and every so often a very small tail (ray, or spark) would be visible upon it. The &#34;light&#34; seemed to have a reddish glow emitting off of it every so often. After passing over us, it switched direction and began to hover downwards, slower than before. After watching it for a while longer, it then vanished. Certainly, it was not anything I had ever witnessed before, not a comet nor a satellite. Definitely not an airplane or alike craft.  My friend and I are both 22 year old females. We were both 100% sober during this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a full moon outside and I decided to take pictures of the moon. I didn&#39;t see anything initially when I was taking the pictures, but after reviewing the pictures there is a saucer like object in the sky. The shape was not in all the photos so I don&#39;t believe it was a camera malfunction. The saucer had a blue color to it on the dome part of it and the rest of the saucer was gray in color. Other than that I can&#39;t really say what it was or how long it was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Though the address listed in the report was correct, meaning it belonged to the phone number listed in the reported sighting, and there was someone there by the name of the witness, he denied ever seeing this object and then stated he never filed a report to NUFORC. I did read the report to him verbatim to see if it would help his memory, but he still denied that he made the report. I assured him several times that I was with MUFON and that we were not affiliated with the government in any way and promised absolute confidentiality.  I am not sure if the witness has changed his mind about his reporting of this event, or it was a hoax of some sort.

It was blueish white and radiated from a single point. Cloud coverage was low so we didnt see any distinctive vehicle. 2 or 3 seconds later we heard a distant deep clap of thunder, and it was structured like a sonic boom, but much deeper. there was increased flight traffic in the area for the next 2.5 hours.Also i heard my first &#34;jets&#34;about 2 or 3 minutes after the flash. they were there pretty quick, but DAFB is at least a 8-10min scramble to get that far south, leading me to believe our planes were already aware of the situation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m south of Lake Monona and it was in the north-east sky. It&#39;s cloudy tonite so the light was kinda blurred. It was a roundish light that was going in a horizontal circle/loop. The speed was fairly fast but wasn&#39;t consistent.. the loop it did was also not a perfect circle. The light was not being beamed from the ground but could see a light beam at the same level as the object. Not sure how high up it was... about the same level as a plane when it flies this way coming into the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It came from the west then headed in a northeast direction. When it was overhead of us it just stopped and stayed in that position for about three minutes. At this time we grabbed a pair of binoculars but it still looked just like a very bright blue spot. Also, it wasn&#39;t always a constant light. It would pulsate, sometimes very brightly. When it started moving again, it was moving fast and due south until we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No red or green lights were associated with the object. The object was black against the deep blue sky: the sun had already set, but the western sky was still a little bit light, making the outline of the delta shaped object fairly distinct. The object was travelling parallel to I-19, north to south, perhaps 1000 or 2000 feet in altitude above the Santa Cruz River. A single stream of blackish jet exhaust seemed to appear from the rear of the craft as it travelled southward, relatively slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was my guess that is was around 150 feet in length and was about 150 yards away and maybe couple hundred feet in the sky. It was dark gray with various light gray shadow patterns. (Like the pattern leaves make on a side walk with the sun shining through.) At first i thought it was a plane and my eyes were not focusing right but there were planes around in the sky that day miles away and that i could see clearly. I made a right turn and the an immediate u-turn took no more than 3 to 5 seconds to complete. While doing the turns i kept my eye on the location as much. My view was blocked for a second because they way a two story house is positioned. When i got back into view the craft was no where to be seen, in any direction. then i freaked out a little<n>

The connection I have made was in fact a sense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To begin my story I must start back on the day of May 18th, 2008. It was around 8:30 A.M. on a Sunday and I was suddenly awakened which was unusual because I usually sleep in until noon. Upon waking up, I can’t describe what happened, but I felt something out of place in my house, I got up, and found that my dog who normally slept in a separate room, had been outside my room scratching at the door. This troubled me, so I went back into my room, grab what I determined to be the heaviest, blunt object in my room, (which at the time happened to be my Guitar Hero Gibson) and proceeded down my stairs leading my dog by the collar. I decided to look outside of my house and with dog and guitar in hand, walked outside. When I got outside, my dog immediately took off running, and did not come back for six days.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out side, I found nothing, and proceeded back into my house, feeling hungry and not in the mood to make myself food; I decided to go to McDonalds and to look for my dog on the way. I did not feel normal until I had left about 20 yards from my house, where I did indeed see my dog, but he would not come when I called him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this, albeit out of the ordinary, was nothing to what I would discover in the weeks to come. When I had gone to McDonalds, eaten my food, and come home, I found throughout the day that I was no longer hungry. I had also discovered that my athletic ability, which was already significant, had dramatically increased; my times in the mile dropped from 5.03 to 4.27, and continue to go down, despite my being in the off season for track, and no longer practicing as hard. In the past week alone, I have grown 1/16th of an inch, and in total over the month that followed this event, have grown about an Inch and ½. I only now need to eat one meal a day, and my Vocabulary, Math skills, and Memory have vastly improved, and I dare say they maybe on par with others who have achieved doctorate degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have noticed similar changes with my dog, which is 16 years old, and has the agility of a puppy. I searched my property and found nothing; similar occurrences have happened with my neighbors, only effects are less impressive than my own. All doctor check outs have found nothing unusual. I will continue to monitor my process as time continues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Outside there were three bright orange lights to the west and seemed to all be travelling southwest at a constant speed. I spent about 3 minutes getting my video camera, then got a single lens binocular. Not much detail could be seen except the color, and they appeared to be moving southwest but also at an up angle as they were getting dimmer. There was another bright star near them so it seemed possible that this was already something very far away. The three lights dimmed out of view at different times, the topmost light dimming last.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One second they were there, then nothing. We asked ourselves what we thought it was because it was over the water at some distance, yet very obvious. Today I spoke to a friend who said that there have been reports of possible ufo&#39;s in the past month, but we both laughed. I looked it up on my computer just now and read that what I saw was also reported 2 weeks ago. maybe there is somthing to it so I am writing you today. I am curious if anyone else saw anything as well last night. Who should I contact without sounding like I am crazy?<n>

It never moved, itjust hovered about 5 miles away but we easily seen that it had pale gold and pale red lights that went across the front horizonally, which blinked and not a real fast blink. Then it was gone, no take off, nothing that you could see it leaving it just vanished into thin air. We never took our eyes off it and the most amazing part of it was the way it was there then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/17/08 17:30|Pleasant Shade|TN|Sphere||Solid blue orb hovering in bushes & trees observing.Saw it after viewing photo of General Lee car the next day|2/6/15|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/117/S117077.html|165|ndxe200805| Solid blue orb hovering in bushes &amp; trees observing.Saw it after viewing photo of General Lee car the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a interesting story to share.  It was May 17 in 2008 &amp; it was a beautiful spring day with mostly clear blue skies.  My band was set to perform at an star studded private music event for charity.  Members from Lynyrd Skynrd &amp; Marshall Tucker were the most famous of performers.  The event was hosted at the home of the musician who put this whole thing together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the evening, every band that performed had a electrical problem with their sound &amp; a few times the power completely shut off leaving the sound engineers puzzled.  I was so afraid that when it was our time to perform that we too would have the same power problems.  We performed around 4:00 p.m. &amp;, surprisingly, throughout the entire hour we performed, we didn&#39;t have any electrical problems.  We were so relieved &amp; felt lucky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After getting off stage &amp; mingling with other guest,I decided I would take some photos of my own.  It was now around 5:30 p.m. &amp; the sun was closer to setting to the west.  We had the &#34;General Lee&#34; car from the Dukes of Hazzard there &amp; I took a few photos of different guests at the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within the next 5 minutes, I remember thinking that a photo of the mountain side with the visible moon would be a good photo.  The landscape of the property was beautiful.  I took my photos with a Aiptek brand HD camera with a 6 mega pixel photo resolution.  For 2008, this was decent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, I start to view all the photos I had taken.  2 photos struck me to be odd.  The first photo was a photo of some guest standing by the General Lee car.  I noticed in the distance, a solid blue orb in the bushes.  You can zoom in &amp; see it better.  I&#39;d say it was at least 100 ft away from us hovering there observing.  There were no balloons.  At that time I google searched blue orb &amp; had only found 1 other &amp; was not satisfied.  Now there is more photos showing blue orbs &amp; mostly from ufo reports.  The photos before &amp; after the blue orb showed nothing.  The third photo after the blue orb, I see a black saucer looking craft right above the trees on the mountain top.  You can zoom in &amp; it doesn&#39;t look like a bird or hawk.  It seems to have an antenna on top of it that is slightly tilted.  But it&#39;s just not clear enough when zooming in for me to tell.  I always hoped that someone with pro photo software could zoom in without distorting it to get a detailed view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve loaded these photos up at mufon also to share with others &amp; to compare since more folks are getting similar photos.  This site should let others see the photos submitted.  This has intrigued me every since that day.  I immediately connected this as to a ufo or paranormal experience.  A lot of times people will say that around an ufo or ghostly paranormal event that they&#39;ll have electrical problems or an power outage &amp; this came to my mind.  I also see the light orbs that others report.  Whatever these things are, they are spying on us.  I feel no need in being contacted by Nuforc because the owner doesn&#39;t live at the property anymore.   What you see in the photos is what you get.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for reading my story.<n>

After exiting a store in the Tualatin area, I was walking to my car in the parking lot and a very bright light in the northern sky caught my eye.  It was a warm sunny day with only a few vapor trails in the sky – no real clouds.  I then noticed two bright star-like lights in the sky, to the north of the parking lot area.  They appeared to be high in the sky, but slightly lower than jets would normally fly.  They were moving very strangely at right angles and seemingly together.  The lights were bright white and very bright.  I observed their movements for what seemed like 5 minutes or so and I then noticed an older couple leaning over their SUV and the man was looking through binoculars in the direction of the UFO’s.  I went over to the couple and we watched the lights for about 10 minutes or so more.  He said he could see fluorescent green lights on the lower half of the oval object.  He stated that it appeared to have a metal appearance.  He said “those are NOT airplanes!”  Then one of the lights went behind the large vapor trail and we lost sight of it, while one of the lights proceeded to move to the right side of the vapor trail.  Then we lost sight of that one too.  We then noticed about 5 jets heading from different directions all going in the same direction/location and at about the same height in the sky of where we saw the lighted objects. Strange….<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had no wings and was about 50 yards away following north also.  There was a plane between my car and the object and I noticed the plane was gaining on me slowly.  I kept glancing up and the object was going very fast.  It was a clear, sunny day and it was out of site in maybe 10 seconds.  My nine year old granddaughter asked me what that was and I asked her what just to see what she would say and she said,&#34;Not the plane, that other thing.&#34;  I told her I did not know and she asked me if it was a UFO and I just repeated that I did not know.  I didn&#39;t want to scare her.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was on duty standing behind one of our stations talking to three other firefighters. It was just before lunch time on May 17th 08. I was looking up and to the north,north west. I spotted a silver/white craft flying from the north going due south. After watching it for a couple of seconds, I yelled out LOOK. The other firefighters glanced up but did not see anything then looked back at me. I again yelled LOOK. They all glanced up again but did not see anything then looking back at me. A third time yelled LOOK and one of the firefighters saw the craft as it flew out of sight. He said that he saw it as it flew away but thought it looked like a feather. He could not explain how it was flying in a straight line. The craft was hard to see against the clear blue sky and flying at a high rate of speed. There was no sound or was there any cloud that followed the craft. It is my estimation that the craft flew about 20 miles in 15 seconds. It also looked to be about the size of a large airliner when they are flying at cruising speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could not estimate the distance.  After a few minutes they floated straight up and  stretched out into a straight line ( from north to south)  2 red now appearing to be bright stars facing south , and 2 white facing north  disappearing westward.  There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best description  of these objects is parachuters, but this doesn’t seem probable since they were not decending.

I dont think any man made flying object can turn like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About a minute later we saw an orange glowing light moving extremely fast in the sky coming from the opposite direction of the plane.  The color was kind of a dull orange, almost like a fireball.  After a minute or so of moving fast, it started to slow down and then it came to a complete stop.  A minute after that, it disappeared.  I rolled my window down and heard no noise whatsoever coming from the object.  It was a very dark and clear night.  This is probably one of the weirdest things I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63228.html|178|ndxe200805| Bright flickering object seen in Western/Northwestern sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this with Mufon. I will use the exact content as in that report:  Long Description of Sighting Report My husband and I noticed an extremely bright flickering object in the western sky last night. We have seen this on occasion, and assumed at the time it was a star. Last night I looked out the window to see if the sky was still clear (we have been pounded by rain in the Midwest lately). I noticed two flickering objects in the western sky, and I grabbed the binoculars to see if they were planes. They did not move like the planes we see over our home, which have a different light pattern, and typically move quicker, either heading to or from the airport. By the time we grabbed the binoculars, we were only observing one object. The other object had moved out of our sight. It looked fairly stationary, so that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t think it was a plane to begin with, but line of sight maybe created an illusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my Sony 20x Optical/800x digital zoom 8MM video camera. I had to put it on a tripod to keep it steady as you will get extremely jerky movement trying to zoom in on distant objects with digital zoom. (very sensitive to the slightest camera movement.) I used the Night Shot Plus option (infrared) on the camera to record. I taped about 40 minutes. During this time I had to readjust the camera several times as the object would move out of frame once I had a steady focus on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I captured the video this morning an up loadable digital file. I edited out most of the jerky movements caused by me trying to refocus and reposition the object in the camera frame. (There still are some on the video and they are obvious quick up and down movements.) I do have some steady video clips of the object in frame and you can see the object moving left to right out of frame on its own. I put the clips together in one file.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess this could be an extremely bright star but I do not know enough about celestial objects and how quickly they should move out of frame based on our planet&#39;s rotation. The object also gives off a rotation of colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Video clip is loaded up in the Mufon database if you want to see it.<n>

It stopped then started the fall again, slowly.  Then it suddenly broke into 6 pieces, which were more round than teardrop.  These pieces moved in a slow arc around the sky - this was all taking place just over the football scoreboard in the endzone, so it would have been looking toward the southwest - over the Arkanas River or in that area.  This happened several times, each time, the main light broke into pieces.  These hovered, some we could see, some went behind the scoreboard and were lost to our view in the trees.  Numerous people sitting near us were watching as well - some were even taping it on their camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was going very,very fast.  Then, all of the sudden, it stopped in mid-air and hovered there.  It zipped to the right at an extremely fast speed, which i&#39;ve never seen any other flying object do!.  It hovered again to my right.  Then, it just went blank.  The light literally just went invisible or teleported.  There was nothing there.  It vanished in the sky.  It didn&#39;t fly somewhere, but just went blank.  As soon as i saw it, four car alarms next to me went off!  There were no people so i found it strange that it did that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then it started to move north slowly (maybe 2 or 3 minute duration).  I think it blinked a few times before fading completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed another traveling a lot faster from west to east but was only able to watch it for several seconds before that one dimmed and faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked hard to see if this was a refection from the sun off of a couple of planes, but I could see nothing at all in the exact area after they faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did notice after the second light faded, further east, my eyes caught a black/dark object in the sky with no lights on and it was cigar shaped.  Could have been a plane but I didn&#39;t hear any noise from it or see lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All these objects seemed to be very high up but I am not a good judge of distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think much of it with all the hoaxes around but it certainly was entertaining for the time being.

Looking for shapes and I pointed out Orion to the kids.  By vision maybe 3 inches above the screen, (facing NE) there was a triangle of what appeared to be just stars, but between two of the stars was another that was fading in and out.  Thought it was cool and pointed it out to the girls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About that time the previews started and we quit paying attention to anything else.  The previews run about 15 minutes and the screen goes dark again before the feature starts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked up to see if the one fading in and out was still there, and the triangle of stars I was using to coordinate the position were gone as well.  This time of year the stars rise in the sky, i looked above and to both sides, they were simply gone.  I dont know the exact date, about 2 weeks after the news in phoenix went nuts about the return of the phoenix lights. (I dont care what the news says they were not flares, flares do not reconfigure their positions and flares sent up attached to regular(kind you buy in the store) balloons from and individuals backyard(as they claimed even less so)can not be seen from other cities, would not last that long, nor could a reg balloon hold its position with out moving before deciding to reconfigure its position then holding again.  Getting off topic sorry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know much that much about space other than i love to watch the night sky.  I know what different satellites look like passing in the sky. These too are not found to simply be sitting still fading in and out, they travel in the sky.  I have no idea what i saw.  Like i said it was just interesting due to short time following the &#34;Deer Valley Lights&#34; &#34;Return of the Phoenix lights&#34; or whatever they are calling it now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This type of thing fascinates me, I have always held an interest in this field, though  never really have done anything about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have heard many stories from family that are absolutely out of this world &#34;no pun intended&#34; things that i was not a witness too, but know the witnesses to be honest, most of them anyway.  Things that my family has seen that cant be explained away.  But the reason i have been looking at these sights the last few weeks was to see if anyone else had seen what i saw, or espescially if they had seen what happened to it, where did it go, how did it vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing reports from phoenix near the same timeline, i decided to go ahead and report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Email given is my work email, and phone is home # Basically evenings or weekends<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The object was not twinkling which made me believe it was perhaps a planet, the object was extremely bright for an astronomical object and the light was of a white/blue color. While I looked at the object, trying to discern what it could be, the light was extinguished, It seemed to me as if some kind of object had come in front of the light, obscuring it. Though it occurred quickly, it seemed as if a dark circular  object roughly the same size as the light moved over it, causing the light to be unseen. The night was very clear and cloudless, I looked in the location the light had been and nothing in the air was present that could have blocked it out. Over the next half hour,  looked in the same location hoping that it was merely a cloud that passed by abd that the object would return  to being visible. The object did not return, there was nothing in the air that could have obscured any astronomical  object. I believe there was something flying within our atmosphere that deliberately extinguished this light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was as if someone was shining them to look inside my window. They were around the top part of my window near the roof. There are no traffic lights in my residential neighborhood. The lights wobbled as if someone was walking with a flashlight.  Outside my bedroom window is my deck which is on the second floor and no one can access without a ladder. The lights wobbled and then went away. I thought it was just a reflection of something inside the house. Then it happened again and I awoke my dog to go out onto the deck with me to see if anyone was there. Nobody was. So I came back inside and went into my bedroom and it happened again. About 5 seconds each time. My dog saw it too and his ears went up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live overlooking Puget Sound and off in the distance I saw an aircraft flying south. I called 911 to report and they said they didn&#39;t have any other calls and they confirmed that we have no flights leaving our airport at that time. But it could have been a medivac helicopter at the local hospital so maybe that is not even related to my experience. Anyway, that&#39;s it. It was really eerie and there was no sound accompanied with the lights and nobody on the street or anywhere around my house when I went out to the deck to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was driving and figured it out after driving 2 hours the wrong direction. after turning around about 1/2 hour later noticed that there was what appeared to be lighting near a mountain. it was a large amount of it and after about 10 minutes after getting closer i said outloud that is not lighting, it was not moving like a storm would, what is that.  after coming around a curve about 10 minutes later there was a huge white light on us. I have helecopters fly in my neighborhood and live near an airport but this was like nothing i have ever seen.  it was huge atleast the size of a car.  since i was driving i was stunded but also i was thinking of stopping.  my 84 yr old mother in law and husband said to keep driving.  my husband saw the craft move over the car and just disappeared. i wanted to turn around but they would not let me.  there were no sounds in the air either so i know it was not any type of aircraft<n>

I leaned my head against the window and caught site of one small red light hovering over a distant mountain. The red light blinked four times and then a diagonal bar consisting of four other red lights would light up too. This only happened on every fourth blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This pattern continued several more times but I didn’t alert my boyfriend because I was unsure about what it was. As we drove around the mountain, I finally decided to alert him to what was there but because of his position in the driver’s seat, he was unable to see it. I strained to see the lights but could only do so for another minute or so. Even though I knew I was looking at the same point in the sky, the lights stopped blinking entirely and soon, it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was in a familiar area that I’ve taken often so I am sure this was no type of tower and it didn’t resemble any type of jet or other aircraft that I’ve ever seen. It may have been moving but due to our changing position and the winding road I was unable to tell for sure. I haven’t seen the lights since but I am sure I saw it this night because it lasted several minutes and was very distinct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

Lake Ontario is about 8 miles north of where i was sitting. I looked out toward a blinking red light toward the lake I know to be a metal tower light. As i gazed at it, 2 bright orange lights suddenly appeared. They did not move at all and were positioned right next to each other. As i watched,I began to realize this was something unusual.then a third light appeared and all three repositioned in a split second to what may have been a mile apart from each other.Then they were gone in a blink of an eye. I ran into the house about 200 feet from my barn where i was sitting. I grabbed my video recorder and came back. The following I recorded at separate intervals as they vanished and reappeared several times.  After about 3 more minutes, they reappeared. Now they were moving slowly side by side and then one over the other when they split apart and separated in what was only a fraction of a second and again were now a mile apart from each other.they sat there perfectly still,almost erie still with no motion at all. Then, one of them began to alter its round shape into what appeared to be 3 triangles with light shooting out from between them.the amber color remained steady throughout.The triangles appeared dimmer than the center light source.After about 45 minutes to 1 hour, they were gone.Again, I have the footage on my JVC video recorder. the Recorder is only 2 months old and is in perfect working condition.I have seen two other UFO crafts in my life.One over my home as a young boy,and the other over my workplace in buffalo NY on august 2 12:20 am 2000.The latter was a 1,000 foot craft with red and white lights. It had a black rail structure and was shaped like a giant eye.This craft was enormous and moved without sound.Vanished one light at a time.<n>

To start my report, I would like to say, that I do not believe in UFOS (I mean the extra-terrestial ones that is).  I believe that what is up in the sky, and I can’t identify, I call it a UFO.  And that is what happened about 10 months ago (It could be a year ago) .  Why report it now?  Well, I was just watching a program on TV tonight about UFOS and it brought to mind the day, about 10 months to a year ago that I saw one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It so happens that it was about 6:20 to 6:40 p.m. and I was in my back yard cleaning my lawn equipment.  When I finished cleaning, I raised my arms to stretch and between two trees that are  about 25 feet tall and spaced from one another about 15 feet, in that small space (I was about 20 feet away from the trees),  and for about 5 second or less, I saw what appeared to be an extra-large black Jet Engine moving (by itself) from Canovanas to Rio Grande to Luquillo.  I know what a Jet Engine looks like because I worked in the Airport and that is what it looked like.  It was flying alone!  The &#34;extra-large black Jet Engine&#34; that I saw was about 500 to 800 feet up in the air and about 800 feet (could be a little bit more) away from where I was standing.   I saw it so clearly, that I could see orange, light yellow and blue streaks of a thin flame streaming from the front to the back of the engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the distance that I was standing I would say that it was probably moving at about 100 or more miles per hour.  If I were to figure out it’s size from the distance and height that I saw it, I would say that it was probably about 8 to 10 feet high and 10 to 12 feet long.  I may be wrong, not sure.  I did not hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I proceeded to tell my wife about it and I called my daughter, who lived in Luquillo to her cell phone, but she told me she was in San Juan, but that she had not seen anything strange and told me to call the radio stations to verify if some else had seen anything.  I did not call the radio stations.  My wife, daughter and son believe in extra-terrestial beings and were delighted with my &#34;sighting.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later I turned on the radio to check if someone had seen anything, but no one talked about any sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Thought I should tell my story to verify if anyone else had told a similar story in that time frame for the Puerto Rico area.  The sighting date would be either May or March of 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,   Rio Grande, Puerto Rico 00745<n>

We were traveling south on 27 highway.  We were just before TO. were there was open fields, we were not yet were the tall buildinds start to apear.  I was sitting in the back seat when I looked out the passenger rear window   I saw a very large craft, 5 or 10 miles across, hovering over Missasaga.  I said whats that, to the 2 people who did not beleive in ufos. They laughed at me when I told them about them, so I had my revenge.  They both looked at the same time and saw a frisbe type craft .  You could see sky below and sky above. Greyest black. I could see windows there.  Both people saw and did not reply to me.  They were stunned.  Now at this time I would like to say, that, I am realy sure that they have a , for the lack of a better term a beam . It is not a beam it is more like a lightbulb.  It shines everywere.  This beam will make you want to forget that you saw somthing and you will want to go back to doing whatever you! were doing before you had the incounter.  They can very the strength of it.  You can overcome its efects by consentrating hard.  If you donot know about the beam you will put this exent in the depest part of your mind and never access it again.  I also beleive that we have this in our own satalights.  We were being beamed , heavely.  I said to the driver pull over.  No reply.  Because we were moving we went behind some tall buildings and when we came out the outher side it was gone.  I think there cloak failed and they turned on the beem, till the cloak ingaged.  It was clear this was a craft hovering over my city.  This is a true storie I swear !<n>

I took a couple pictures from the south end and ended with 4 more from the north end. Not knowing until a friend and I looked at one of the pictures, that there was an Unidentified Flying Object in one of my shots. It happened to be my last shot before coming back in to the building. The picture turned out to be just like all the other U.F.O. pictures out there. The way the UFO is sighted in the picture, it appears to be flying by. The top of the object is bright and the bottom appears to have a dark shadow. This disk type or saucer flying by was one of my most unbelievable moments. Please take the picture and clarify what it is exactly. I think it clearly shows there is something out there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I always look up at the stars ect when im out smoking in the am, Theres alot of shooting stars ect... I was looking up to the sky, when a boomerang object flew right over the top of me. I have no idea what it was, but it was clear as day. It made no sound at all, It had no Lights that i could see on the bottom side of it. It almost looked kind of transperent, to a mirror chrome like object. It looked like it could have been man made, but it would be very hard,, the edges were so clean. Also the there was no sound and it moved so effortlessly. Im not a liar and i have no reason to lie. I saw what I saw, and yes it was a litgtle strange. I still think about it everyday. If i seen it again or a picture of it, I could easily identify it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You, ((nme deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I looked to my right, out the window, and thought it was my imagination at first, or a reflection on the window, but then I realized that there were these three blueish-white lights moving pretty slowly across the sky. From what I know about the orientation of my house, they were moving southwest to northeast. They were way lower in the sky than a normal plane would have been, and weren&#39;t blinking or anything. At frist I thought that they were three separate lights, but then I saw the silhouette-like triangular form, and it seemed like they had to be all part of one object. There&#39;s a lot of cloud cover tonight, so they must have been flying below the clouds. I didn&#39;t hear any noise or anything. I could easily have missed them/ it if I hadn&#39;t caught it out of the corner of my eye. I&#39;m pretty creeped out by this. I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know if I feel comfortable giving my whole name in that contact section. Maybe that erodes at the credibility of all this, but this is really weird.

5/15/08 01:05|Tokyo (Japan)||Egg|20 minutes|Planet-size sighting in Tokyo, Japan|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63144.html|203|ndxe200805| Planet-size sighting in Tokyo, Japan<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke at 1:05 a.m. on Thursday, May 15th. in Tokyo, Japan.  I immediately noticed a large planet-sized object directly behind the flight line, appearing to the West.  I live on an air force base, right in front of the runway on the 8th floor.  My apartment has large windows in each room that face the runway and the mountains beyond it.   I viewed the object for about 20 minutes.  By 1:25 a.m., it had faded out of sight.  I used a Runton Trail Buster compass to determine its Western location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object resembled the moon, but it was about two and one-half times larger than the moon.  It had the luminescence of the moon and did not move about quickly or erratically.  It hovered  behind the flight line, changing from a dull beige glow to a reddish glow, almost like the glow you would see during an eclipse, when the moon passes in front of another planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were large markings on the face of this large planet-size object.  Although I could make these markings out through binoculars, the definition of the picture was unclear when I zoomed in with my Panasonic DMZ LZ3 camera.  However, I took several pictures of it – several still photos and one moving picture, using the flight line lights and a red tower light as a frame of reference. I steadied my arm on the window sill to keep the object from moving; however, it was difficult to keep my arm completely still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to break away from my line of vision with the object to write out a diagram of the large markings I saw on the face of this planet.  I could only see these markings through the binoculars.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FACE OF THE PLANET:  The markings looked like the outline of a scroll-like antennae on either side of a head with an arched body.  Two lines projected out from both sides of the body, ending in two circles (like hands).  At the bottom of this body, a small projecting line ended in another very large circle (like feet).  When I kept going back to view the object with my binoculars, I noticed the picture on its face had now tilted, and the patina of the object took on a reddish glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tilt:   The scroll-like head changed from a 12:00 position to a 9:00 position while the large circled (feet) changed from 6:00 position to 4:00 position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went back to my paper to continue filling out the drawing, and then returned to the window, the object was no longer there.  I did not actually see it vanish or blink out.  I only noticed that the last time I went back to view it with the binoculars, the patina had appeared to change color, its face had shifted position to a tilt, and it wasn’t glowing as brightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding the actual shape of the object, it was almost like looking at three-fourths of the moon.  It wasn’t a complete circle.  It was as if the northwest portion of the circle had been blotted out by the darkness.  The edges delineating the object were fuzzy looking, where it melded into the surrounding darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this object twice before.  The first time I saw it, it was at 11:00 p.m., in a more northwesterly direction.  It was more prominent then.  It also glowed a little brighter and appeared to be a little larger than it was tonight.  Then it appeared to be three times the size of the moon instead of two and a half times the size of the moon and much lower in the sky.  I viewed it for about 15 minutes.  At that time, it had actually sunk down behind the mountain range, northwest of the base.  However, I thought it might be some kind of lunar eclipse until I noticed the moon’s position the following night and how different it looked from what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second time I saw the planet-size object, it was at 4:30 a.m.  It was located in the same location, northwest, directly over the mountain range.   It slowly sank behind the same mountain range it had sunk behind before, during the previous 11:00 to 11:30 p.m. sighting.  This time I woke my husband up (who completely denies the existence of UFO’s).  He thought it was the moon, but the moon appears higher up in the sky in a more southerly direction and glows differently than this object glowed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Due to the consistency of the location of these sightings, I believe there may be some sort of alien base within the mountain range to the northwest of the flight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was no noise that I could hear.  Estimated altitude, about 5,000 feet.  I know this because I live near Philadelphia Airport.  It usually takes an aircraft about a full minute to travel from horizon to horizon, and they only go east-west out of PHL.

I asked him where it was as I could not see anything moving directly above me.  To which he stated that it was not above us but just above the horizon.  Upon looking at the object it moved across the sky to the left, then suddenly to the right again and then upwards.  Then stopped and just hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought this might be a helicopter, but there was no sound.  Secondly the speed the object was moving at was far to fast for a helicopter in the night to move and change directions as this object did.  The object was triangular in shape and seemed to have red, green and yellow lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We kept looking at the object for a good 30 minutes.  Then just a short distance from the object there was a flash of light every 30 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the whole time we were looking at the object it would proceed moving in all different directions and sometimes hovering for a few seconds.  During all this time we heard no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually we retired to the restaurant at the lodge we were staying at.  Upon our return to the house, a good 2 hours later, the object was gone.<n>

There was absolutly no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke, at 03:53 on 5/14/08, to an amazingly bright blue light shining directly through my black mini blinds into my face. I quickly opened the window to see a large electron blue star slowly moving across the sky. This star suddenly became very large and seemed like it exploded, yet there was absolutly no sound. Out of this star came an oddly shaped aircraft that looked similar to a space shuttle, yet instead of having wings on the sides, it had two cylinders that thrust came out of. The ship took off like a bat out of hell, faster than any airplane i have ever seen. The odd thing was that the star it came out of was traveling east, while the ufo shot south. The small glimpse that I got of this craft showed two very bright red lights on the bottom, a green light on the nose, and the rest of the craft glowed orange. After the craft disappeared (which only took a second) i saw three other glowing stars, same as the first. Within half of a minute, they faded awy. During the whole expeience, there was never any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First there were several bright flashes of light that completely lit up the night sky. It was almost like that from a lightning storm on a clear night. It reminded me of a bright camera flash. Then a huge ball of light sped behind some trees and disappeared. There was no noticeable noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly a very bright orange, round object appeared in the northwest sky moving due east. It was moving slower than a meteor but faster than an  aircraft. It left no train at all behind it as meteors do. This object was extremely bright , and there was no sound at all. As it moved due east, it remained bright until the last 5 seconds when it slowly faded out  then disappeared  unlike any meteor I’ve ever seen. It looked as if someone/something slowly turned down the brightness until it became invisible. It was visible for about 20 seconds approximately. A very interesting object indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve viewed many meteor showers since 1983 and always attempt to view every meteor shower each year. I follow them very closely, and this was no meteor at all. This I’m sure of. The sheer brightness of it coupled with the speed and  lack of a train convinced me of this. After observing hundreds and hundreds of meteors through the years, it’s easy to tell the difference between a meteor and an unknown object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the first time ever, I reported my sighting to our local PD, and the officer I spoke with seemed to believe I’d only observed a meteor. I know better and tried to explain to him why. I’m unsure if there were any other reports  of this, but I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The time was about 0030 hours. I was at work. I was parked at the intersection of The Plaza and Eastway Drive(Charlotte,NC). I was facing towards uptown Charlotte. I observed a very bright glowing green object(almost neon green) descending from the sky towards the ground. It was very fast. It disappeared behind the tree line in front of me. I observed it for only about 3-4 seconds. The object appeared to be a cylinder shape (in a upright position).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My window was down and I did not hear any sound. A friend of mine was parked next to me but facing the opposite direction. It happened so fast that by the time I could get any words out of my mouth, when he turned around it was over. It was without a doubt nothing from this planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

She said she had seen a strange, seemingly near stationary strobing light outside our west window of our second story bedroom window-probably about 15 degrees off the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the bed, I looked out the window but did not see the lights.  My wife got up and opened the blinds covering a south-facing window.  I then saw a very bright light – bronze in color.  It was flashing regularly and was very crisp and clear at the source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our home is located in the flight pattern of an international airport and also a local community airport, so aircraft are regularly flying over our home.  I have lived in this area for over 10 years and have seen many planes both during the day and at night.  Nothing about the light I observed resembled an airplane.  I don’t know exactly how to describe the light but it was just so different than any light I had seen in the sky before.  The size made it look distant but without knowing the size, determining the distance was impossible.  What was unique about that light was that it was so crisp, and on a hazy night, one would expect an aircraft landing light to be fuzzy at a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched as the light traveled a little above the treeline defining the horizon heading approximately south.  The light alone was strange, but after watching it for a few seconds, it made a smooth but tight turn upwards and changed direction to the north or northwest.  After the turn, the light increased in speed suddenly, and then flew out of my view.  My wife ran to the other end of the house in time to catch another glimpse of the light before it disappeared completely from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is hard to judge size, distance, and speed without known references, but the object was either very small, close, and slower  or large, distant, and extremely fast.  There was no sound, so a small/close object is not likely.but the light was so crisp that it didn’t appear to have been a known object at a distance.  if the object were distant, then the speed as it climbed up was incredible.<n>

I happened to wake up shortly after midnight and observed through a west-facing window, a very odd single bright rapidly-flashing white light in the distance above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the light appeared stationary, almost like a firework then it moved to the southeast.  The flashing was noticeably quick and in a pattern, not like a typical plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up my husband who also saw the light through a south-facing window.  The color of the light changed from white to a brunt reddish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was moving at an unremarkable speed when it changed directions and accelerated upward to the northwest out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The window was open but there was no sound associated with the activity. The acceleration of the light was uncharacteristic of any aircraft we have ever witnessed.<n>

I own a commercial cleaning business this is my usual routine route every night. I saw an object which at first glance I thought this was a low flying plane but the object was moving at a very low rate of speed. With my head hanging out of my window now I gazed at the object for over a couple of minutes as I proceeded slowly down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was triangular and resembled a Stealth Fighter. My employee riding in the front seat saw the same thing I did. The employee in the back seat had limited view of the object. The object was traveling adjacent to my truck at a crawl speed and then to a hover. It appeared dark-toned and had lights at each tip of its triangular shape. I was near 1604 East Main when I turned in the parking lot of the bank to further look at the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I entered the parking area the object ascended slowly to a higher altitude and slowly gained speed moving in the opposite direction I saw it first traveling in. The object was silent no engine noise or jet sounds. The flight pattern made me conclude this is not an airplane, jet, helicopter or anything of that nature. The object left my sight as it moved across the sky opposite from the parking lot.<n>

I waited for the Impact sound but there was none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It actually was big enough to cause a little fear because , if it was far away it may have been quite large. Since there was no sound it may have all burned up or landed so far away that I couldn&#39;t hear the impact sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ERROR ON PREVIOUS FILING -SAME INCIDENT This is an EDIT to previous report because of an error I made in the direction that  I was traveling. I said I was going East which was incorrect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I actually was TRAVELING WEST on University Blvd. in Wheaton Md  towards Bethesda Md. so the Meteor or whatever it was , was probably traveling in an arc between ENE and ESE and NOT Northwest as I previously stated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw it, the initial point of the FIREBALL was at 75 degrees up from the horizon and arcing downward with a long tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I spoke with this witness, and he sounded to be quite serious-minded.

It was not very thick maybe 10 or 15 feet. Ieasily make out the plastic housing for each light as well as the gray superstructure of the craft; it was dusk with just enough light to make out detail.

It looked to be falling somewhere over the haymarket, possibly a bit north west from that area. The angle in which it was falling I would have to say was between a 20-30degree decline. I would have to guess the actual light appeared very low in the atmosphere and seemed to definitely falling within this imediate area. It was a greenish yellow maybe a little red or blue around the outside. The movement wasnt seen for 5-10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Suddenly The object went upward very fast and disappeared.  I looked around the sky and in the Northwest sky I saw another one, exactly the same (it may have been the same one) - but then I saw another one further to the north.  I know for sure there were two in the sky at the same time.  They were bright orange and silver - glowing, flourescent like - then my view became blocked by some trees and I lost signt of them completely.

I was observing the stars as I usually do and noticed a moving object. It was like a star but moving at a fast pace. I watched and waited in shock. Then it stopped, and started doing circles. As soon as it stopped I grabbed my friend by the arm and told him to look. It took him a few seconds to see what I was seeing but when he did we were both in awe. It was a star shaped circular object. There was no colour or sound, just a white light. We observed this object for 3-4 minutes before an airplane made it’s  way into the area. As soon as the airplane came into view the object took off and that was all we seen of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a believer in ET life forms, but I was still in shock. I have been trying to get my friend to listen to some of the stories told about UFO’s for the longest time , so it was kind of funny that we both got to see this together. I am an assistant Produce manager at a major grocery chain in my area, he is a FT night-shift clerk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This took place over or around the  Limeridge Mall area where my friend and I both work in Hamilton Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was slowly moving upwards and then very quickly disappeared. There was no noise. This was not an aeroplane as there was no other lights on it and no sound, plus it was not on the usual flight path that the planes in this area take.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I steped outside I was stunned. I saw a triangle shaped craft with three lights(two red one blue). It made no sound, except for a humming. And it was going so slow that I waited for it to fall out of the sky. Nothing I had ever seen before could stay in the air going so slow, except for a air balloon. And I know for a fact that this was not an air balloon. It slowly moved over the trees and when I came to my head again I tried to chase it but it was no where to be found.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost one month later we saw the same thing at the same time as before. I am not sure what is going on but it has us freaked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this is not connected to the story above but it happened and I swear on my life that it is true!  When  I was around 12 years old myself and some friends were on a camping trip with our boyscout troop. Late  that night after every one went to bed four of the other guys came and woke me and my tent mate up. They were going crazy and yelling saying that we needed to hurry up and get out there. When we got out of our tentthere was a wall of light, bright light. The next thing I remember it was morning and none of the other guys would talk about it. To this day if I bring it up they walk away. Something happened and it has been almost 12 years and they still will not talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was about 15 I saw the same thing that I saw here recently. It was a trianlge shaped craft moving very slowly over the road that me and two friends of mine were going down. We stoped the car and watched as the craft went over the trees. We sat there for a few minuets and then we saw five jets going the same path that the craft had taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that I am starting to sound crazy by putting all this up at once, but this is the first time I have gottn up the courage to tell anyone else. Around five years ago I was asleep with my wife and for some reasone I woke up.

I would guess that it was moving to the northwest from a great distance away but I can&#39;t be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was BRIGHT and made a swooshing sound.........like something out of a movie. As quickly as it burned out, it still lit up the yard and the bedroom like daylight. It appeared white with a slight yellow tinge to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not change directions from what I could tell so I am sure it was just space junk or a slow meteor.

It was traveling at and incredible rate of speed and the only reason I didn’t think it was an asteroid or something like it, was it had one green and one white light on it. I did not see a tail of burning dust like a falling star usually has. My wife corrects me and tells me that there was a red burning tail to it. It hit the ground approximately one mile North of State highway 287 and about 4 miles East of Interstate 45. I did not hear a crash, but I did see the sky light up momentarily. It didn’t last but about 2 to 5 seconds. I didn’t see any emergency vehicles anywhere. I didn’t read about it in the papers or the Internet. I was wondering if anyone else saw this and what it was.

Also, the size of that flame was like propably the size of a car (kinda estimating cause of the height it was I cannot be sure), and it was pretty fast (at least like 4 times faster than a car at 60mph). It wasn&#39;t fireworks or any of that sort, it was something weird. Maybe it wasn&#39;t an UFO and it was a meteor or something but it seemed to weird so I thought that maybe I should report it.

It’s hard to stress in words how distinctly different from an airplane this was, and when I saw it my mouth dropped and I immediately pulled over to the side of the road. I live at the base of a mountain (the outskirts of the city) and was heading north-east when I saw it. After I pulled over to the side of the road and I pointed out what I saw to my girlfriend and she became as awed as I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now that I had stopped moving I was able to properly asses what I was looking at. It was a ball of light about four times as big as a star but smaller than an airplane light that was blinking/flashing multiple colors (I’m talking almost every color imaginable) about 10 times per every 1 time that an airplanes light blinks. Basically, if an airplane blinks 2 times a second, this object was blinking about 20-30 times a second in alternating colors like red, blue, green, purple…etc in a hard to catch order (if any). However, that wasn’t the half of it… Its one thing to see colorful flashing (strobe-light like) light, but it’s another to see this object’s crazy movement in the sky. It came from the north-east heading north-west in an irregular, non-linear path that consisted of circles and zigzags with behaviors similar to that of a firefly. It was moving nothing like an airplane/satellite/whatever, and occasionally consisted of dives that dropped the object hundreds of feet in order to regain its altitude only seconds later. At this point I was freaked out enough and decided to call the police for help… I called 911, who forwarded me to the Local Police department where they took my information and told me to keep my eye on the object. I continued to watch the object in its irregular path towards the west when it suddenly seemed to stop in one location for about 10 minutes! It seemed to stay in the same vicinity but make loops, dives and etc, all covering great distances in very short periods of time. Wanting to contact a UFO hotline, I got into my car and drove the remainder of the distance home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home I did a quick search to get to www.nuforc.org and call the hotline support. I talked to someone for a good 5-10 mins about the object I could now barely see in the distance. He told me to call up friends closer to the object (that was now far west) to see if they could spot the object as well. As he was telling me this I noticed a helicopter flying over my neighborhood (with a spotlight) at the intersection I had told the police that I had witnessed the object (I don’t know if that was a coincidence or what).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later drove back to the original place I had seem the object, where I called my friends on the other side of town. They all couldn’t see the object because they lived more into the city and had a harder time seeing stars (because of the many lights) let alone a weird blinking thing. I eventually drove home and filled out this report as the man on the hotline had told me to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I initially thought it was just a star but then I noticed a red light flash underneath the &#34;double star&#34; which caught my attention. After observing the object for a few minutes it appeared to be slightly moving around but hovering in the same general vicinity. I also witnessed it flash a green light underneath the &#34;double star&#34; as well. I witnessed the flashing lights at least 6-7 times but there was no pattern or rythm to it. The flashing light was very much like a light you would see on a plane fying by. I went inside but returned after about 15 minutes. The sun was coming up on the horizon and all the other stars had mostly faded away. This object was still in the same spot and still shining with the same intesity. It was definitely the brightest object in the sky compared to all the other stars. I finally went to bed around 5:00 am. Could this object have been the space station?<n>

It didn&#39;t have a tail or anything like meteorite would, it was just this blue orb, going really fast, then it faded off.  I&#39;m surprised I even noticed it because it was traveling so fast, it was just the light that got my attention, I think it was coming up from behind me, and traveling South.  The only thing I could think of was meteorite, but I&#39;ve never seen a light blue colored meteorite with no tail before.  What is strange is that I saw a blue ball of light earlier that week traveling really fast, low on the horizon, in a linear direction like a jet, but faster.  I thought it was strange, but didn&#39;t think anything of it until I saw the same thing again, only alot closer.  There was a van on the road with me that night, and right after the sighting, I saw them turning around, so I&#39;m not sure if they saw it too or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I turned the corner a couple of blocks away I had glanced at the clock on my radio and it read 12:14, when i arrived home and sat on the couch it was closer to 12:34 or 44 I can&#39;t remember but it seemed very odd to me.<n>

I hate that way, especially coming back from Georgia, because the last leg is a highway that is very dark. Somewhere around Scottsboro along highway 72 (West) we noticed this very bright, very annoying flashing light just ahead of us. It was just behind the treeline across the highway on out left. We first thought it was far ahead of us and we would soon pass it, but after miles, and miles, it was still just ahead of us. We started wondering what it was, because it was so bright and distracting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The more we paid attention, the more we thought it was moving, just in front of us. I kept looking behind us thinking maybe it was a series of lights, but no, there was nothing behind us. I thought it might be some elaborate storm warning system, because we were headed into bad weather, though it was on the other side of the state at the time. A couple of times the treeline vanished, and I saw at least one row of horizontal lights, maybe two. At one point I thought maybe it was part of a prison tower, because it seemed to be attached to something that looked like the top of a prison tower. But if it was, it was a moving prison. I also briefly thought maybe it was reflector lights on a wire running across the road, but I&#39;d never seen them before and why were they visable from behind a tree line if that is what they were?  Finally we paid very close attention to it, and as I looked and the treeline cleared for a moment what I saw was a row of very bright lights on the bottom of what looked like an observation deck. On top of that was a very, very large, very flat platform, which seemed to be oval shaped. I said to my boyfriend &#34;I may be crazy, but that looks like a giant UFO.&#34; He kept glancing but he was driving, so he couldn&#39;t see as much as I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I realized it might be something worth taking a picture of, it had finally started to slow down and inch behind us (mind you, we were driving about 60-70 miles and hour this whole time). I took a couple of pictures, which were mostly black, and I took a bit of video, but by then it was way behind us and seemed to be fading. After that we drove into a storm with real lightning and we didn&#39;t see any more strange lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was, but if what I saw was what it was, then it was a gigantic UFO. We were on Sand Mountain, which they say is where most UFO sightings in north Alabama are concentrated. It was really cool, and I wouldn&#39;t swear it was a UFO as in an &#34;alien&#34; ship, but it was something unusual. I was glad we saw it together, because no one would have ever believed me if I had been alone.<n>

I was amazed at the shape of the craft, other weird stuuf about it was that it was moving sideways at a really fast speed towards the N.Windham area, at the end of each side of the V shaped object was 2 balls of light, the one on the right was flicking the other was constant, I lost the object in the tree lines my friend said he didnt see anything just a V object, he is really skeptic of these stuff  I really think he saw what I saw. Another weird thing I notice was that its that this object was emiting light when the sun was still up! Ive seen planes fly in this area and about the same time of day and i dont see any lights from them. I posted this same bulletin a couple weeks ago but it never was posted. I also want to add that Ive seen weird things most people I know dont, Ive seen a Disk shaped Ufo up front in Buffalo , NY in the summer of 1997 , and since Ive moved here , IVe seen a couple of triangle shaped ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

May 10 - 11 2008.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard the jets getting close to here, where they make there turn and return back to the base. When I first looked out the window in the door, I was looking up trying to see the jets and when I didn’t see the jets then I glanced down and I seen the &gt;   V formation.  It is hard to explain but it just did not fit, it was like a insert, it looked identical to cd discs except no center hole  but the reflection was identical and a perfect V formation. I have heard that there are more sightings when there is a war, now there was no war here but there was unusual air activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I seen it over McMichell Rd. I think it was stationary for a while then it started moving slowly to the right and I seen it go behind the trees at my neighbors house across the street, I thought I would continue seeing them but it never came out from behind the trees. It was energy of some kind. I did not take my eyes off of it. It never entered my brain to get a camera, I was just locked on to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If someone would have put 7 cd discs in a v formation on a long sheet of Plexiglas and was moving it to the right out side my door that is what it looked like. It stood out, it was on top of the view I was seeing but it went behind my neighbors trees across the street. It just did not belong there, do you know what I mean. it was memorizing, I could feel it, or I was like connected to it in a way. I did not count the discs but when I drew them on the computer 7 discs looker closer to what I seen compared to five discs.  One thing for sure it was a perfect even V, but in this direction &gt;  .  It was so different from photos  and videos of UFO&#39;s I have seen. I don’t think it carried passengers. It just looked like energy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I always wondered why people took a sighting so serious and went to gatherings. I am hooked now. I will always be searching for what I seen. It only lasted maybe a minute.  There is no way it was of this earth. The object I seen makes all the others I have seen photos of look primitive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 7 Discs in a V formation, like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Things like this don’t fly. But these discs did. I was not looking up. I was looking out, like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I had seen something, about 40 years ago I was in WV, south of Moundsville late at night  and we were up on a detour above closed RT 2, and it was dark no houses around and my friend and myself seen light, that is it, just light, but I know I was going across the top on the detour when we seen the light, but I remember being back down on RT 2 and one of us said to one another, did you see that and the other said yes and we never talked about it after that.  I did not see anything, I just remember light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later he moved away and we never keep in touch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Arrangement of discs did not survive the transfer to our database.

As I stopped at a red light at 53rd street, I stuck my head to look at it. It was white with a black glass top. I was looking at it during the red light when suddenly it started acending upward and made a curve shape turn and didn&#39;t see it anymore. That&#39;s what I saw.

The object was bright and then would fade and then brighten again.    The light was bright white. It hovered and changed brightness for approximately 15 minutes.  By this time 5 other people had seen the object.  The event took place during soccer games at a place called Nike Park.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object started to move South at 10:25 at a slow speed and then started to move faster.  Before it began to move at a faster speed the object had paused and then hovered for a short period of time. At this time the object would still brighten and fade and brighten again.  The object headed South east and then vanished.  The object was visible for approximately 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time air traffic around the area had stopped.  The object during this time had no observable wings, tail fins or sound.  As it moved through the atmosphere it did not leave any contrails.

I looked up and there in the sky was this shiny metal object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects colour was that of aluminium foil. I thought at first maybe it was a plane that had the sun reflecting of it but it moved to the left (west) and that when you could see it was a silver colour. The shape was very hard to make out. Perhaps a cigar shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to the kids - &#34; Do you all see that up in the sky that silver thing&#34;  They all replied &#34; yeh up there&#34;  As I was watching it I saw this lights come on, it reminded me of when someone turns on a set of spot lights in the daytime and they are driving towards you. The lights had to have some power behind it for me to see this from where it was hovering.  As I was  still watching it, it suddenly disappeared - it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned back to the kids and said &#34; Did you all see that - can anyone see where its gone to - its vanished - its disappeared&#34;  Each of the children said they all saw it and watched it vanish into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was not a plane and I dont think it was a weather balloon unless they now come equiped with really high powered lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We decide the spot we picked wasnt breaking that well, so we moved on to where it was thought to be better. We moved allong the sand dune as we watched the clouds roll by. Just as we watched, we saw a black ball aroung 1 km away from us. As it flew, it curved and flew against the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It gradually came closer and as it did, didnt didnt appear to be growing in size. When it was directly aboves up approximatly 50m high, i went to grab my mobile to take a picture. As soon as i took my phone out of my pocket, the black ball slowed dramatically, i put my fone back into my pocket as the thought of abduction passed my mind. when the phone slipped back into my pocket, the ball sped back up and flew out alond the horizon towards the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was black and in a perfect ball sha. It appeared to be tennis ball sized from where we saw but actual size was probably a bowling ball, to a gymball&#39;s size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it fully resisted the wind and showed no signs of drag. it made absolutely no noise and didnt appear to have any windows or abstract objects, it was just a ball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after this event occured, a severe thunder and hail storm cam in for about 1 hour, then the storm ceased into a beutiful warm calm day. because we were walking across the dune as a shortcut, no one else appeared to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While in bed we noticed outside our bedroom window a very bright light in the clear night sky.  At first we thought this was a beautiful bright star, really nice and bright in the sky. As we continue to look at it from the bed we both noticed that the bright light was beginning to move across the sky.  At first we didn&#39;t say anything to eachother but then I asked my partner, &#34;Baby, is it moving?&#34;.  My partner looked at me and said, &#34;OMG are you serious right now?&#34;  The light began to zig zag across the sky from left to right really fast and then suspend itself in the sky and moved directly up and down in a north to south direction. We got up from the bed and moved to the window and stared at this light and watched this occur for about 45 minutes or so.  The light continued to move down and toward the area of the house and we saw different color lights flash brightly.  At this point our hearts were beating really fast, we were all paranoid and scared because this is something we always read, hear and see things about but never thought it would be happening for real. We eventually got back in the bed and went to sleep but had to turn in the other direction away from the window in order to try to get to sleep for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Initially, they appeared to be at 1,000 feet. They were moving about 200 mph, with one object trailing the other. Then the two bright objects began taking their own path, seeming to moving in a wave like motion, I yelled to my partner to look at them, then they moved into the light fog, which made them more noticeable due to the shimmer of round bright light reflecting in the fog. Then, they began to pick up speed, each taking two different paths, the front object rose in altitude rapidly and shot out toward Golden Gate Bridge and disappeared. The second object remained visible for about 3 additional seconds as it appeared to fly away at a lower altitude in more west then the prior. The weird thing was that the round pulsing light object seemed to get brighter in size as it speed off and dissipated into the fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were no traditional aircraft. Secondly, they were not spot lights from the surface to the sky, they were fast moving, silent and erratic flying craft. They did not make normal flight patterns or aerial movements.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Facing east, almost due east at about a thirty to fourty degree angle a brilliant flash of light occurred. I am not stating this was a craft, but it was certainly unlike any meteor i have witnessed for several reasons: (one) it had no trail, but appeared as a brilliant flash (2)that faded. No colors really...No smoke, no noise, no residuals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> slighty, into nothing.

He asked me(16yrs old) and my sister(14yrs old) if we saw them. we looked out side the window and when we saw them we were like &#34;whoa&#34;, so me and my sister  kept a close eye on them while our dad drove. Then our dad pulled off the freeway on the side of the road and we watched for a while. slowly one by one the three white lights disapered. and then one by one they came back on. im not sure if they were on top of a close mountain or if they were in the dark sky. the lights were very bright, they had a white tint, they were round(spherical) shaped, and it made no sound what so ever. so  then my dad started to drive back on the freeway  and came to a freeway exit, and wanted to get closer to the lights. but we told him not to. so when we came to the stop sign, me and my sister were the only ones to notice a bright white light flash behind our car. we thought there was another car pulling up behind us , but when we turned back to look there was nothing there. so after that we got back on the ramp to the freeway and headed home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Partially through the movie, at about 22:30, I saw a flash in the corner of my eye, out of the open window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dismissed it, until it happened several times. I figured it was a manipulation of a flashing, from a window, in the flats across the street. I grew intrigued and stared at the sky. There was absolutely no sound made by the flashes, no definitive lightning form or such - and the weather was definetly not the sort for such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a flash in the clouds, silhouetting a black, stretched sphere. At arm&#39;s length, my fist would be the same size as the area of the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> at 23:15, I began to type down what time I saw the flashes. I recognised a pattern forming, the flashes every 5 minutes - 23:13, 23:18. The time was nearing 23:23, so I pulled out my webcam, turned on Windows Movie Maker, set the cam up, hit record...then my PC turned off. It powered back up straight away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No more flashes have occured after this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came to my attention later on in the report, that there were no clouds in the sky upon closer inspection, (earlier my eyes were watching a movie on a 22&#34; monitor, blanking out the details of a black night sky), yet I had clearly seen clouds, reflecting the light of the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish my previous report had been saved, for I have a lack of memory for accute detail in wordings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any questions, I would be happy to help.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It did not move but was not in a location for any star and was much brighter.  We were north bound at about 20 mph.  It was slightly to left of overhead.  The object was in the same position as we drove on a straight street.  After driving 0.3 miles there is a slight left curve in the street which caused us to drive directly under it.  There were two intense lights (about 60 degrees apart) that illuminated the details of the object.  Opposite from the lights on the other side was a bright blue pulsating flame like my propane torch. We could see circular metallic bands on the bottom.  Our best description would be a two cup-type saucers, the top being upside down on the bottom one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After traveling a total of 0.5 miles, we made a right turn to a street to take us home.

So we are driving towards the craft.  The craft came right over the car and about tree top hight form the car.  I got the best view when it was right above us but more to the drivers side of the car.  Thats when I noticed the craft was square in shape and had four lights one on each conner of the craft.  It was really close to us and it had no sound it kept moving past us.  I was with my girlfriend and I was very curious but she was very scared thats how close it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

NOT a red/green flasher that might be expected on a local/small aircraft.  And while the second COULD be a plane far off banking or something like that...the first craft was VERY bright and we are not in the proximity for landing lights...and heard no aircraft noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first, I thought it was just a plane.  It was much to bright and was stationary to be a plane.  My friend who was driving noticed it to and decided to get closer to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is where it gets wierder.  We got very close to it.  My friend drove his car down into a dead-end drive and the object came straight at us.  He then turned off his headlights and got out of the car coaxing me to go with to get a better view. As soon at the lights went off, you could see a beam of light heading for my friend who was already 10 feet in front of the car. He dodged the beam as I ran out of the car. We proceeded down the drive about 20 feet, noticing that the object took a sharp right turn. We ran back to the car trying to chase it further, but to our amazement there was no sign of the rather large craft. It dissappeared within seconds of us getting back in my friends turbo-charged car(so it only took about 10 seconds to get back on the road and head after the thing in the sky). The object made no sound and had no propeller on top so this was not a helicopter. This was not a plane and its landing gear. I cannot explain what this was, only that I have spent the better part of my young life studying this phenomena and I have never witnessed something like that in real life. I was terrified and I felt very strange afterward. A feeling I cannot describe. This is the Hudson Valley though and I have been told this sort of stuff has been going on for years.<n>

So maby 10=11pm. I was in back yard smoking and looking into the south west sky. I didnt see it forum I dont think but i saw what i can only explaine as a white ball of light. It wasnt a plane or a star... It looked more like if you took a dozen stars and put them all together. Thats about the brightness and the size that it was. It moved slowly west about the same speed you would think a airplane to move. Then after about 12-15seconds of moveing it just started to fade away. The fadeing only took about 2-3seconds then it was gone. It didnt fade because it was getting farther away. It went from being the full brightness that i saw from the first second to just fadeing in about 2-3seconds. Then it was gone and nothing happened after. I am in a city whee i can look into the spy for 10mins and watch 15 airplanes fly by. I know what they look like how they sounds. Flashing lights etc. THIS was not a aircraft. This was a light just like a star but many times brighter...That moved west to east about 12-15seconds then just fadeds(not dsapear) it faded from bright to nothing within 2-3seconds. No idea what it was but its like nothing i ever seen befor.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They seemed to come back in about 5 to 10 minute intervals and sometimes groups of threes, twos, eights, fours, twos again and also sometimes at a lower altitude...they almost had a diamond or circle with wings look and glowed orange. This is the first time ive ever saw n e thing like this and im glad i was with my buddies or id of thought i was crazy, and i had to go home and go to bed cuz of work early in the morning, but if they are still flying by at the same intervals, then there would be some going by right now as i write this.<n>

I was talking on the phone and was looking up into the night sky. I was describing the weather to a friend of mine when I noticed a triangular shaped object moving silently in the sky above me but not directly above me. It was fairly high up and was completely dark. The only way I was able to see it was because the city lights were reflecting off of it. If I hadn&#39;t looked up I never would have seen it. It was very dark in color like a slate gray except for circles at the tips of the triangles and perhaps circles in between and in the center. It happened so fast and I was so stunned by what I was seeing that I can&#39;t be sure of the number of circles. The circles looked to be a light gray. I had the impression that the circles were like bumps. It moved fairly slowly toward the East. Because it was so dark, I was unable to see it for very long and it soon disappeared into the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/8/08 12:36|Las Vegas|NV|Sphere|10-12 minutes|Witnessed a small object that actually stopped moving alltogether twice and lasted about 15 minutes before it disappeared out of site.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63068.html|275|ndxe200805| Witnessed a small object that actually stopped moving alltogether twice and lasted about 15 minutes before it disappeared out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is a beautiful sunny day with no clouds in the sky. I was on my lunch break from a class talking to my wife on the phone in my car when I spotted out of the corner of my eye what at first I thought was a skydiver as it looked to have a falling motion. I worked at an airport where they have skydiving and have witnessed jumps from the ground view several times. This was a little different as it looked way to high and was moving to slow. At first I was thinking maybe it was a military drop of some kind. I was on the phone so I did not give it to much thought but then it stopped moving all together. I asked my wife to go outside and see if she could see the object as well but she was several miles away and I could not point it out to her in the sky. As I was trying to tell her which way is North it started to move again. This time instead of the falling movement it began to climb and move to the East. At this point I asked my wife to go inside and do a google search for someone to call about something like this which she did and is how I was able to call you immediately after the sighting. As she was giving me your number the object once again stopped. After about a minute in which I was trying to tell my wife once again where it was with no avail it began to move again. This time it moved to the North West and at a very fast speed. It quickly disappeared out of sight. I got off the phone with my wife to call you but noticed two of my class mates looking up in the same direction. They where returning from lunch and saw me looking up in the sky. They spotted the object as well and witnessed it from the first time it stopped to when it disappeared. They both have agreed to give their names if needed. My phonecall with my wife lasted 20m 43s so the entire sighting lasted for a good 12 to 15 minutes. Like I said I worked at an airport and witnessed planes, helicopters, weather balloons and skydivers and this was definitely not any of those things. I am not sure what it was. I am not saying i! t was fr om outer space or aliens or anything like that. All I know is that it was very high and actually stopped moving all together and changed directions like nothing I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/8/08 10:15|Irvine|CA|Circle|10 mins|Circluar shaped object outlined with blue lights flying over Irvine, CA|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63094.html|276|ndxe200805| Circluar shaped object outlined with blue lights flying over Irvine, CA<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know John Wayne Airport is really close by but it has a curfew, and it&#39;s not that close enough to make the planes look that big when they take off. This thing was a perfect disc shape. It was a saucer, it had very bright blue lights that outlined the sides, it varied in speed from practically hovering to way too fast for any helicopter to ever catch up, and it even flew on it&#39;s side and while changing it&#39;s angles. And it was either really big, or really really close. And it just stayed flying around in the same general area for a long time, five or ten minutes. I know helicopters don&#39;t do that and if they did, they would have a searchlight looking for something. This thing looked like it was just having fun flying around as if it was joyriding. And if it were a helicopter it would make that continuous droning helicopter sound. I think this thing was actually really close because I did hear it make some noise every now and then, depending on if it was flying towards me or away or if it was flying flat or on its side. And it definitely did not sound like a helicopter. It made this sort of high pitched buzzing sound. Sort of like those toy planes, but a little different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, I was actually walking back to my dorm hall on the UC Irvine campus. Judging by the area where it stayed flying for the ten minutes or so that I saw it, I know I couldn’t have been the only one to have seen it. It was only around 10 o’clock at night and I would guess that it was flying somewhere in the direction of the 405 Freeway or the Irvine Spectrum Mall; somewhere anyone could get a good, unobstructed view of it. But I went up to my room, and the window of my room faces the same area where it had been flying when I had initially seen it outside, and it was still flying around for another few minutes. And when it went away, it didn&#39;t fly off into space, it looked like it was flying downwards to earth and it disappeared from my view behind the other dorm halls and trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved overhead very slowly at first, didnt make a sound and then it stopped. Hovered in one spot for a few seconds, darted to the left very quickly and stopped again. It started to move left slowly and it hovered again for a few seconds over the neighbouring town Lingan, as far as I can tell. The light got dimmer and I couldnt see it any longer. I cant say I&#39;ve ever seen a plane that could move like that. Maybe a satellite? I dont know much about them, but i doubt it. If anyone else saw this, please post.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went into my girls room to check on them and when I did, I saw out the back window a bright light hovering over the trees in the back yard.  The trees are approximatly 50 yards from the back of the house.  I then went outside and observed the light moving slowly back and forth across the tree line.  I&#39;m not sure how long it remained there because after watching it for 15 minutes I realized I needed to get back to bed.  I don&#39;t believe it was a helicopter because I could not hear roters at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Contact on this or the previous report I submitted is okay, through email.

When we first noticed the light from our workshop at Hunter&#39;s Point Shipyard it was stationary over the SF Bay between SF and Oakland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very bright red light that didn&#39;t blink on and off.  It stayed the same intensity of red the entire sighting until a jet plane flew near it at which point it blinked completely out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second later it reappeared but at a much less intensity of brightness.  It blinked completely out again then reappeared a second time even less intensely for an instant then blinked out again and never reappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time we watched the light we could not hear any sound coming from the light.  It was moving much too slowly to be a plane or meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you want to view the video feel free to contact us.<n>

I saw two yellow lights moving very fast north.  I said to my husband &#34;Look at that what is it?&#34;.  My husband looked up and saw the two lights, they moved apart, then moved closer, became one light, and then vanished.  The whole incident lasted for no more than 5 seconds, and there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I remember sitting on another one of my horses when I looked up into the sky and saw an approaching light. There were no flashing lights and the light was pure white. It was moving as if it was a helicopter, but as it got closer, I saw that it wasnt. As it got above my pasture I freaked out and jumped off my horse and got into my truck, because it wasnt slowing down and kept getting lower. I took off and drove back to my house which is about a quarter mile away from my pasture, and when I turned around as I was driving through the gate, the light was about 20 feet above ground and I could clearly tell it was ONLY a floating light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I drove back to my house I told my parents what had happened. They went back to check out what happened (I did not go because I was too freaked out), and my mother reported seeing the light but it was hovering over my sick horse, and then just floated away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew it was something that must have come from somewhere else...that was definately not some airplane or anything like that. I am a no nonsense kind of person, so this is not something I just made up for fun. This is real and the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was looking out the window a little to the right of us where there was a large field and some woods. I saw this BRIGHT blue object zoom across the sky, it disappeared right before it hit the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I wasn&#39;t sure what to think of it, like maybe I was just seeing things. Then my friend said that she saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discussed other possibilities of what it could be, such as a shooting star.  It was far too big, low, and blue to be a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There wasn&#39;t any sort of sound or explosion when the object suddenly vanished into thin air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still so shocked by this event, I want to know if anyone else saw it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.

It was obout 300 ft. above the ground. At first I thought someone was flying something from the ground. The craft moved closer to where I was parked. All at once it turned and headed straight west picking up speed rapidly, and then it turned and went up northward real fast at an angle of about 45 degree and disappeared. The craft was disc shaped with A dome on the top. The color of the craft was silver grey.  I heard no noise as I was in the car.  I started to get out of the car and tell other people to look, but they would think I was crazy.  I had no camera with me to get A picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was Sunday. Later that night, a fireworks show was presented. About a minute after the finale we saw a couple of fireballs. We thought they were part of the fireworks, but they lasted for about four minutes. Other witnesses jokingly exclaimed that they were UFO&#39;s, but no one really cared. I only noticed one but three more appeared, one after another. They were orange colored and it seemed to &#34;twinkle&#34; as well. Their shapes were simple ovals. They seemed to move slowly towards us, but they didn&#39;t get any bigger. Near the fourth minute, they turned to the left (west) until they faded. I only noticed 4 of the ovals, but there could have been more due to trees in the way. My guess on their location when they first appeared would be about five miles east from dunlap and disappeared in the Dunlap area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw a boomerang shaped object than just hung in the sky very far away.  Did not seem to make any strong movements at first.  Hung there for about 5 minutes (or 5 minutes from the time I first spotted it). Then it started to either shift its shape or turn and appear as a string-like object.  It continued to do this for a few minutes against a blue sky.  It would get smaller and start to fade away as if moving far away or becoming invisible.  There were planes flying and it appeared to be a lot higher up than them (from my perspective). It looked similar to if you were to take a piece of string and put underwater- just floating there slowly shifting (I assume it was very large even though it was far away.  It faded away, then moments later a ball appeared, &#39;flew&#39; around for several seconds (going one direction stopping abruptly then shooting off in another) then faded into a blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Half an hour later I saw a helicopter coming from that direction with lights on in the middle of the day.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got into the yard and my dog started going to the bathroom.  I saw some thing high in the sky. It was hard to see how high it was but it was about level with the clouds.  It looked triangular with very bright lights at each point.  It was much larger than a plane or helicopter.  There was no sound apearing to be coming from the object.It stayed in the sky for about 30 seconds before quikly turning into a haze and disapering into the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I don’t know if the whole thing was a dream or if it was real but I can assure you that they communicated to me mentally and not verbally, as we do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first encounter with the aliens took placed several years ago.  They took me to their galaxy that had 5 suns and several planets, which I was able to see from their spaceship.  Since our galaxy only has one sun, I was astonished to see so many suns in just one galaxy.  I don’t recall ever getting out of the spaceship; the whole trip was just like a “tour” through the universe.  They were green aliens, very short, not with the usual configuration depicted in Roswell, NM.  Their heads were wide, mostly by the cheeks area and they were very nice to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My most recent encounter was with just one alien.  This one had pink skin and came-up in a small gray color spaceship.  His head had a light bulb shape and he was skinny.  He told me via mind communication that it was time for me to go with them for good.  Some sort of force started taking me towards his spaceship (I started floating in the air) but then, suddenly, I decided I did not want to go yet, and saw myself back into my home.  The next day, May 7, 2008, I received a call from one of my doctor’s office, in which I was told they found pre-cancerous cells in a yearly routine exam I recently had.  Every year this exam comes-out normal and, all the sudden, right after the encounter I had with the alien, it happened to come-up abnormal.  Now I am going to have to get a biopsy done on June 2nd to check on the stage level of the cancer findings.<n>

I watched with confusion and speculated as to what we were viewing.  Planes frequently travel over my homestead on route to the Louisville Airport at seemingly faster speeds at much higher altitudes than what this mysterious light was.  I proceeded to view the orb&#39;s somewhat jerky scale of the sky until it was directly above my backyard.  The small light then emitted a radiant blue flash and continued across the scerney in a much more rapid manor.  I never took our sights of the propelling enigma and it never really diminished as does a meteroid.

It was within view between two trees, then it disappeared. This is about when I got a bit startled. A few seconds passed when it reappeared, it looked like a twinkling star this time, except it was changing colors rapidly, and it looked like it was completely at random. By this point I was thoroughly freaked out, so I sat back down on the couch to watch TV. After 30 or so minutes I got up and looked out the window again, the twinkling light was gone. I would also like to note that I have been seeing UFOs and such almost every day here in the Marietta/Roswell GA Area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought it was Venus but it was brighter... My coworker must have looked up too, because after it disappeared he said, &#34;Whoa, was that some kind of spy-plane?&#34;. We both discussed it. Because it was not a plane nor a helicopter because there were no blinking beacon or wing tip lights. There was also no noise! The light simply was very bright and just disappeared!  The sky was clear with few clouds scattered about. We are both truck drivers that work swing. And he, as well as I, know the position of lights on airplanes. Red is port and green is Starbird. And every plane,as far as I know, has a blinking beacon on its belly. I myself, use to work on airplanes at Tramco, at Paine Field for six years......<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was an airplane, then I figured it must be a planet since it didn&#39;t move.  It seemed to hover for at least a minute, then dipped down below the tree line and wavered in a back and forth and up and down motion for a minute or so more.  I got off the phone so I could pay better attention to this thing, and as I watched it, it emerged from the trees, just below tree level, I would estimate about 300 yards away, and came across the field towards the window where I was standing and looking.  I was so startled that I yelled and shut the blinds immediately.  I went to the living room to tell my husband what I saw, so we both went outside to look, but by that time it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were no lights.  It was darker than the sky. It flew about 10 seconds and then veered west toward the town of Toccoa on highway 17.<n>

I looked up at the sky and noticed something moving across the sky.  At this time of year, it is still daylight and there were big, cumulus clouds in the sky.  I thought at first it was a plane, because in profile, it looked to have wings of some sort, but it looked almost like an old bi-plane.  But there was no noise, and the object appeared to be too high to be a plane like that.  As I watched for the next ten to fifteen minutes, this object kept moving further and further away and also appeared to be climbing.  The only frame of reference I had for altitude and distance was when it passed in front of a smaller cumulus cloud (or perhaps through it, because this was the first time I almost lost the object.)  As it moved further away, it seemed to be more spherical than I first perceived, and was a copper color, because it glinted a little in the sunlight.  When it passed through or in front of the cloud, it looked like a black speck, but when it emerged, I could see the copper coloration again.  The only other thing that bothered me was that this object appeared to be fast-moving, because in those ten minutes, it moved in a seemingly pointed direction, all while climbing higher.  The other thing I thought strange was that there was no stream after the object, like a jet leaves.  I estimate the distance traveled at about ten to twenty miles in a matter of eight minutes or so.  I have no idea what the object was, could not see it in the viewfinder of my phone’s camera and lost the object shortly after 7:15 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My job has me seeing a lot of planes coming and going but since I work the morning shift no planes leave until 6am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular morning while working my first flight. I just happened to look in the sky to my amazement I could see a bright object travelling east. Not to sure as to what I saw I rubbed my eyes and the object was moving quite quickly. I was scared and anxious to tell my peers but wasn’t able to grab my radio. The state of shock I was in, I was just baffled as too what I was seeing. The object appeared L shaped in pattern and just seemed to be whisking along.  As soon as some random garble came over my radio the object  then moved higher up and fire seemed to take ahold of the front of the object and disappeared completely.  It was as if the object cut a pocket into the sky  and left my sights completely. The whole duration lasted 2mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon my return to my ready room I mentioned this to my supervisor, and to my surprise nothing was said in return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I look up more in the sky at that time but to no objects’. I haven’t mentioned this too many people in fear that my peers will laugh or even worse.<n>

This light was not usual for the time of morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was the moon because of the purity of the light, but the moon is not in the west at 5 in the morning. I turned and saw what looked like an extremely bright star; however, this star was moving from the southwest at a steady pace no faster than a jet-plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object move overhead and checked for running lights, flashing lights, and sounds. There were no colored lights besides the white-blue light, and no sound at any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object passed over me it light seemed to rotate from front to back and spin. As it spun it became brighter and cleaner to me.  Following the moving light, the object changed course.  It also changed from the white color to an orangish-pink color.  I realized what the object was once it passed over head, having seen one many years ago.  The shape, however, was different. The tear-shape was not exaggerated.  There was only one (I searched for others).  As far as my background, I and my father have had previous contact with a craft like this.  My father (who died last winter) has notes on his experiences on the Ore. Calif. border in the seventies, and my own occured near the same region. The same kind of light moved very fast from Mt. Shasta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have also seen one being chased by Military aircraft while on a hunting trip.  Do people who see UFOs often have more than one experience?<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father claimed he had a stand off with the light and took it very serious that is why I&#39;m reporting this to you now.<n>

The movement of this vehicle and the color scheme of it&#39;s lights ruled out any possibility of man made classification unless top secret.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I was star gazing for a couple of hours prior to this experience. A friend of mine was   also looking at stars and planets; both of us were using telescopes. Around 4:00 or so, a bright round object north west of my location caught my attention. The area and placement of this immediately struck me as very unusual. I grabbed my binoculars and focused in on it. The craft seemed to be changing colors in sort of a loop fashion; repeating. At first, this color dancing thing led me to believe I was looking at a certain object that I&#39;ve seen many times prior with similar color change pattern. After just a few seconds I realized this object was not anything I&#39;d seen based on the intense colors being emitted in a pattern or loop and also how it was moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel the object was more round than anything else; the color behavior held my attention greatly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please let me know if anyone else reported a sighting on this date or any other over this area I will email a picture of my viewpoint and where the u.f.o. was exactly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S.

I watched as it slowly went overhead for about a minute. It never changed speed or made a sound.

Earlier in the week I was driving down a highway (FM 2004) near my home. To my left I noticed what appeared to be two bright objects much larger than any star. They appeared to be changing positions, almost making formations with each other. It was hard for me to look at them and pay attention to the road at the same time. My first instinct was that I was crazy, and that they had to be planes or helicopters. The next time I had a chance to look for the objects they had moved a large distance in the sky. The next time I looked for them I could not find them. I was very curious about what I had seen, but it did not phase me that much. As I was nearing home I can see what appears to be a military aircraft flying overhead at a low altitude. The plane was flying low enough to where I could clearly make out the body of the aircraft from the lights on the underside of the plane. It was sort of an F16 type shape. It was definitely not a common aircraft. I do not recall if it made any noise. I got home and told myself that all I had seen were some uncommon airplanes flying in the area (possibly military).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout all of the last week that night has replayed in my mind. The more I think about it the more odd it becomes. On May 4th, as I was sitting outside something caught my attention to my left. I don’t know why I chose to look that direction at that time, but I almost wish I didn’t. What I saw left me sitting in my chair unable to move for several minutes. An object moving at an extremely rapid speed bolted across the sky away from my position. It had four lights lined up horizontally. They were huge and bright. They were mostly white but appeared to have a mixture of green and blue. I sat motionless in shock trying to come up with words to describe the object I had seen. My first thought of how to describe it was that it might have been 4 single objects moving sort of like a wave in some sort of an aura. While I was looking at the sightings report form on your website, I saw the word gaseous in your checklist. The word gaseous perfectly describes the object that I saw. The four lights were very individual, but they were all encompassed in the gaseous aura. It was a hazy gray color which was very contrasting to the bright white/green/blue’ish lights. It appeared to be shaped sort of like a boomerang. It was either flying at a very low altitude or it was an enourmous object. It was simply the largest thing I had ever seen in the sky. The final detail is that it dead silent and it seemingly appeared out of nowhere only to disappear as it bolted across the sky. I would say it was only visible for a few seconds, but I was looking at it head on from start to finish. The sighting really shook me up. I can definitely say that it was unidentifiable. I became very emotional, sort of terrified. I shed a few tears and finished my cigarette. I couldn’t stop looking at the sky even though I desperately wanted to go inside where I feel safe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes later I’m still sitting outside and am now having another cigarette. I have settled down a little bit. My eyes are still fixated on the sky though. I see what I am almost certain is a helicopter. This is not unusual at all and I did not think anything of it. I could barely hear it; it was pretty far off in the distance. A few minutes later, I start to hear a dull rumble. I recognized the sound as a jet instantly. It wasn’t loud, but it was the loudest noise at the time (it was very quiet). When I see the jet it was very similar to the one I had seen earlier in the week. Although this time it was at a much higher altitude and much farther away. It was flying in the relative direction of the unknown object I had seen about 10-15 minutes earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m writing this right now and it’s only been about an hour since all of this took place. I wanted to get my thoughts while I could still remember all of the details. I don’t know if I am going to talk about this with any of my friends of family yet. I’m scared that they’ll think I’m crazy. This sighting is so haunting to me that I feel I have to report it. I believe that I saw something that is truly unexplainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Two smaller objects led a slightly larger object.  The speed of the front two, seemed to stay consistent, while the trailing one matched the speed of the front two for about half of the time that we viewed.  After that, it slowed while the others continued on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trailing object seemed to stop, just as it was going to fly out of our view which would have been blocked by a tree and buildings.  I ran through the house to get to a better vantage point, but by that time all three objects were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed - honestly appeared to be about the speed I have seen satellites cross the sky, however I do not believe these were satellites - I have never seen three fly together...nor had ever seen one &#34;stop&#34;.  The larger trailing object, was much bigger than a satellite through the naked eye --  and actually appeared to be round.  The front two, though smaller, appeared to be round also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They made no sound at all.<n>

Dozens of citizens called Channel 5 WMC-TV to report this light and on the 10 p.m. newscast, WMC also showed a video shot by a local viewer that shows an unidentified object flying across the night sky just prior to the flash of light. However, WMC has not opted to post this video on their website (indeed, they haven&#39;t even bothered to have their televised report listed), at least at this point in time. Viewers have written WMC to request a link be posted to the film. The light was seen at least as far away as Olive Branch, MS, and from that vantage point, appeared to be north of Memphis.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were a perfect shaped circle, they were a bright orange and pulsated.  They appeared to me to have small circles slightly less bright orange just inside the outer rim of the larger circle.  They moved very slowly, in a arc across the sky.  At first I thought they may have been meteors, except they moved very slowly.  They stayed the exact same distance apart for the entire experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first one just simply got smaller until it disappeared, and then the second one did the same thing in the exact same place.  Then they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were using night sight binoculars while looking at the sky because it allowed us to see ten times more stars than with the naked eye alone.  I am an attorney.  The other witnesses include the owner of a large telephone company and an oil and gas heir.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was watching as several satellites passed across the sky.  About the third satellite I watched made it half way across the sky, nearly directly overhead, and just stopped.  It stayed in place for five seconds and then started moving in a new direction, about 100 degrees from its original direction.  It made several more course changes while it began moving at what must have been thousands of miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I handed the binoculars to the other people there and they also watched the &#34;satellite&#34; complete incredible maneuvers in a lot of different directions.  After about ten minutes of impossibly fast and extremely angular turns and flight, it shot across the sky past the horizon. We did not see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, it was invisible without the night vision Navy issue binoculars and it moved faster than anything the public is aware of.<n>

About 10 15 min driving distance. It rose up from the ground straight up and while traveling upwards much like a rocket it level out once if got to what looked to the normal height of a small plane or helicopter But traveled at least twice as fast as both of these. On its way up it seemed to spiral and had a beam of light out in from of it. The UFO was bright gold, and had this gold aura all around it. It may sound strange but it seemed to have a similar shape to a plane, it had a pointed tip and two wings but the wings were pointed as well it almost looked like a star, I couldn&#39;t see the shape of the tail end it was just glowing gold, brighter than any aircraft i&#39;ve ever seen. I travel towards us a bit to our left and flew overhead as it passes us we didn&#39;t hear a sound, there was total silence. The object travel of passed for another few minutes and as it got further away we saw some ireggular movements, quick side to side movement and quick up and down movements, after a bit of that it flickered to nothing and thats all I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was with an owner of a major telephone company, as well as an heir to an oil and gas fortune.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were the only ones to see them.  There were other people near us but they did not see them.  We were visiting a retired navy ship captain at his home that was built on the top of a very tall hill south of the Fort Davis mountains in west Texas.  I, along with the two others with me, was at the property line ofthis home, away from the lights of the house.  We were playing with a very expensive pair of night vision binoculars the retired captain had.  We were using them to see the incredible number of stars that were overhead.  These stars were invisible to the naked eye and when we used the binoculars you could se tons of other stars and satelites.  Then I saw it.  One of the &#34;stars&#34; directly overhead began moving in random directions, back and forth.  It had been stationary the entire time we were looking up ad then it started moving tens of degrees across the sky in mere seconds.  It moved in a random mode for several minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I handed the night sight binoculars to the phone company owner and the oil and gas man.  We all saw it.  By the time we got everyone out of the house, it was gone.  I saw it take off in what would have been tens of thousands of miles per hour.  It could start and stop and maneuver in ways that no engines I have ever heard of could.  It was extremely high in orbit.  I thought it was another satellite until it began making its sharp turns and starts and stops.<n>

The object appeared to be moving at the same altitude for the duration of the sighting. The object was roughly 100 feet away and likely 3-5 feet long across the side facing my friend and me. It disappeared from sight after moving at a constant rate of speed for about 30-40 seconds. The object made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A group of skateboarders sitting about 25 feet away pointed out the object to my friend and me while we played catch as we did not notice it initially. Interestingly, one of the skateboarders made the comment, &#34;it&#39;s spying on you.&#34; My friend and I continued to play catch as the whole event felt somewhat surreal and there wasn&#39;t an instantaneous cohesive response by us. However, a few minutes later it grew too dark and we stopped playing catch. At that time we discussed the event and did not know what to make of it. As we walked down to the parking lot below the batting cages we hoped to see the skateboarders to ask them what they honestly thought it was but they were gone. After discussing the event, we postulated the only logical explanation was some sort of runaway kite but the seemingly constant altitude and velocity on a clear and breezeless night made that postulation unlikely to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

(Report written at 3:18 pm) The sighting lasted almost 5 minutes. The UFO was a solid BLACK Sphere about the size of a small car, flying about 40 feet above the tree and building line, heading northeast across the shopping areas, as if it travelled up Raleigh St.  I only noticed it because I was waiting for my husband to finish shopping at the car parts store. I was sitting in the van watching traffic go by and it appeared almost infront of me above the trees, I got a really good look at it. I watched it slowly go along, it avoided the cell phone tower by darting around it but then maintained its course and altitude. Once it was over the Hwy 421 it went straight up into a cloud at about a 90 degree angle. I watched it for a pretty long time. When it was infront of me it was OBVIOUSLY a sphere and radiated an outer circle of energy that was bright, and pulsing energy. Quite a distinct contrast of the black sphere against the bright white of a cloud as it passed by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ruled out birds, I ruled out a balloon (It avoided the cell tower and maintained an altitude) It was truly unusual<n>

5/3/08 01:40|Los Angeles (downtown)|CA|Oval|1.5-2 minutes|Oval-shaped, metallic object w/ 2 bright lights pointing down spotted over Downtown LA; disappeared in 1 second.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62967.html|330|ndxe200805| Oval-shaped, metallic object w/ 2 bright lights pointing down spotted over Downtown LA; disappeared in 1 second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the Golden State Freeway (I-5) in Los Angeles, CA heading northbound at approximately 1:40 a.m. on Saturday, 03 May 2008.  The temperature was 59 degrees Fahrenheit; clear skies; 58% humidity; visibility 10 miles (weather.com).  At the 101/I-5 junction in Downtown Los Angeles, I noticed a bright light near the Downtown LA skyline.  As I connected to the 101 freeway junction heading toward the light, I noticed that the light was in fact two (2) lights pointing down.  At first, I believed it to be a police helicopter; however, it appeared to be “locked” in the same spot, too steady to be hovering.  The almost-golden colored lights were large and close together; reminiscent of heating lights used to keep food warm at a buffet restaurant.  Noticing that there were no vehicles behind me nor ahead of me, I proceeded to slow down to 30 miles per hour (I was initially traveling at 65 mph); at which point I was observing the object above my vehicle slightly to the left, allowing me to see it without the roof of my vehicle obstructing my view.  The object appeared to be at about 700-800 feet in mid-air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the object as viewed from directly underneath resembled the shape of a human eye; almost that of a football.  The lights were pointing down and were definitely not police helicopter lights (of which there is only one per craft; usually unstable and blue-white/halogen type).  Combined, the two lights took up an estimated 70% of the shape in which they were contained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not produce any visual/audible means of propulsion.  Its surface did not display any flashing lights, such as those of a police helicopter (flashing blue and red strobes on the sides) or any conventional aircraft.  The surface was dark-metallic.  Thin, fine, vertical and horizontal could barely be seen across its dark surface.  The top or “side” of the object was not visible, since it was viewed from underneath.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area in which it was hovering in is assumed to be restricted airspace for airplanes; both private and commercial due to its proximity to the skyscrapers of the downtown district (less than a mile).  The nearest airport, Los Angeles International is approximately 15 miles southeast of Downtown LA.  Commercial and private airplane routes approaching the Los Angeles Metropolitan area head westbound almost directly above the 105 Freeway, which connects North Orange County/South Los Angeles County to LA International Airport.  This busy and well-known airplane route is approximately 10 miles south of Downtown LA.  It is also viewable 24 hours a day.  Goodyear blimps are known to fly in the area since Dodger Stadium is nearby; however, blimps are not known to display large, exceedingly bright lights.  The object observed was definitely not a blimp; it did not glide or appear to exhibit slight movement.  Dodger Stadium was not hosting any events that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reviewing a map of the area, I estimate the object’s position to have been directly above Santa Fe Avenue &amp; 7th Street (near the 7th Street bridge over the LA River) in Downtown LA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was observing the object from my vehicle (window down, traveling at 30 mph); I glanced ahead quickly to make sure my vehicle was on track before I glanced back to observe the object again.  This went on for about 45 seconds.  As I glanced at the road quickly (about 1 second), I looked back up and the object was gone.  The area of sight in which I had the object in was large enough for me to track a helicopter or an airplane even at high speeds.  As I circled the Downtown LA area via the 101 junction ramp (first northbound, then northwest bound); I scanned the area for the object; however, it was no longer present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background info:  I am a 23 year-old male.  I hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from a private, four-year university.  I work as a social worker in an adult healthcare center in Los Angeles.

I noticed a bright light in the SW sky. It continued to move toward the NE and get brighter as it came closer. The light then stopped in the sky for approximately 2 seconds. It then shifted directions to the NW and quickly faded out of sight. I could see the image for approximately 6 or 7 seconds as it faded. I really want to know if anyone else had seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were doing some routine work when I looked up towards the west and noticed a very bright white light moving very slowly from north to south. Normally I wouldn’t get excited about a &#34;light in the sky,&#34; but this particular light started out very dim, in fact the reason it caught my eye is because I thought it was a satellite, however that soon changed when it seemed to morph into a huge bright light about 10 times as bright and then back down to its original size. It did this several times before fading down to a pinpoint and then just like a light switch, poof it was gone!<n>

What really caught my eye was the speed of this craft....Ive never seen anything cross the sky so quickly. Perhaps something outta Groom Lake?  I am sorry, I cannot use my friends as witnesses because of privacy concerns, but my wife and I and our 10 year old son saw what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ive never seen anything move so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely  ((name and address deleted))  Magdalena Drive Valencia , California , 91011  661-((number deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I stared at it for about 15 seconds pondering if it were in-fact the north star, then realized it was more eastern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about that moment of realization, the frozen star-like light started slightly moving to west in a straight but slow motion. I started yelling at the other 3 people outside with me, and pointed out the moving (non-blinking) bright white sphere of light. We all had a sudden rush shoot through our body’s once we had all realized we’d never seen anything like this before. No one said a word, just mumbled slowly stuff like oohhhhhhhhh! or whattttttt! (I could tell that everyone was truly freaked out.) The light started speeding up gradually while swerving slight zigzags in the sky. About 2 minutes into  seeing this object pass across about 3/4s of the visible sky , it suddenly disappears.  We instantly ran across the house to front yard to see if we could still see anything from a different angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 45 seconds after seeing the light go out/disappear we all 4 see a super bright shooting star looking thing with a long bright tail zoom across the whole sky(diameter about- 8 gauge).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While these events were going on, flashing lights like lightning were striking about every 10-15 seconds and no one saw any actual lightning, nor heard any thunder, we just saw light flashes in the distance.  I’m not too sure if that has anything to do with the light object we saw, but it could perhaps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the 3rd time I have seen unexplained UFO objects with more than just myself viewing, but my 4th time to ever see these floating lights in Nacogdoches within a year and a half. Every time they have been about the same, my first 2 sightings the light was 100% bigger and seemed more of a blue-ish white light- and my latest 2 encounters I’ve been seeing a more white based light circle about the size of a lower-case o (size 12 font).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m just looking for a possible explanation for what I’ve been seeing, or if anyone else has seen the same things that 7 of my friends and I truthfully saw. Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

5/1/08 23:30|Daleville|VA|Light|10 minutes|Saw an orangish fireball moving in erratic patterns in the sky for approximately 10 minutes over Carvins Cove.|11/11/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/104/S104279.html|341|ndxe200805| Saw an orangish fireball moving in erratic patterns in the sky for approximately 10 minutes over Carvins Cove.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around the spring or summer of 2008.  I was working as closing manager at the BlockBuster in Daleville, Botetourt County, Virginia (now closed) and was working with two other people.  We closed the store at 11:00 and were ready to leave by about 11:15 or 11:20 or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we walked out into the parking lot (the Botetourt Commons parking lot where Kroger is), we stopped at my co-worker&#39;s truck to talk.  While we were standing there talking, one of us looked toward the West and saw the object and directed our attention toward it.  He said something like,  &#34;What is that?,&#34; and we watched it but could never figure it out.  It was the topic of our conversation for the next 5 to 10 minutes, and just about the time we were losing interest in it, we noticed that it had disappeared.  We had not actually seen it leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is my description of it.  It was an orange ball of light.  It did not appear to me to flicker like a fire, but just a steady orange glow, like a street lamp.  Sometimes it stood still, then would slowly move in one direction, start turning in an arc, stop, move in another direction, and just generally moved erratically at different speeds in a relatively small area of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very high up but I couldn&#39;t tell how high or estimate its size, but it was significantly bigger than a star or planet.  I have lived near airports and seen all sorts of aircraft, but this did not behave like any of them.  It didn&#39;t seem to have a specific destination but just circled around erratically in the sky, turning too abruptly and moving too rapidly at times to be a helicopter or plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also made no noise.  For a helicopter to be so far away as for me not to hear it (because they are very loud),  it would not be able to appear to make the kinds of movements that this object was! easily making.  The best way I can describe the pattern it made is like lazy figure 8&#39;s that abruptly stopped and started and reversed direction at times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked on Google maps later at the location in the sky where we saw the object, I realized that we were looking directly towards Carvin&#39;s Cove, where most people in the Roanoke area get their water.  It was directly on the other side of the mountain that the object appeared to be &#34;dancing&#34; over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of us three thought too much of it at the time except that if we told people that we had seen a UFO (since we literally couldn&#39;t identify it) they would just think we were joking or full of it.  I still don&#39;t know what it was,  I only know what it wasn&#39;t.<n>

It moved to another spot and blinked again a few seconds later, and kept doing that, jumping around in random spots within a small area and blinking every few seconds, then it stopped. I didn’t get to see it; by the time our friend came and told me, it had already disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I experienced was a very strange change in frequency as I was walking through my house, hearing a very high pitched squeal or whine that seemed to feel as if it were in my head as well. When I went back to the same spot where I felt and heard it, it was gone. This happened right before the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went into google but the only current photo was from May 2008.  At the top of the photo was a purple colored upside down saucer in the sky, enveloped by a light purple colored hue like some kind of cloaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back into google several more times &amp; the object was still there.  I still have the photo on my computer but I can&#39;t figure how to copy it.I only minimized the photo.  But if you put in my address below you should be able to see it too.  There were very few clouds in the sky in the photo.  I have never believed in aliens still don&#39;t.  I&#39;m just passing on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
5/1/08 04:30|Kansas City|MO|Changing|2 1/2 hours|MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP Report:  ..out of the white came a boomerang craft "straight forward" and "flipped" on its side …|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73241.html|344|ndxe200805| ...out of the white came a boomerang craft &#34;straight forward&#34; and &#34;flipped&#34; on its side ...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I go to bed very late do to insomnia.  It was 4:30am and I figured I&#39;d try to get some sleep; upon going to the bedroom I went to the bathroom first.  Something told me to look out that window.  My eyes looked directly under the tree across the street, which I might add, I live in a development.  There I saw hovering about 3-4 feet above the ground which looked to me like sparkly bright orange atoms trying to cling together, shaped in a circular formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I thought &#34;hmm&#34; must me a UFO. I hurried to my window behind my bed to see if I could see it from a different prospective.  After running around like a crazy woman, I decided to go to the front door. This was the morning before the storm and it was quite windy, but some how I missed it getting daylight.  Seems I had missing time; anyway, I looked around and didn&#39;t see it, then my eyes were drawn upward, above my neighbors house across the street only this time it was white, and it seemed to be dancing in mid air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It definately knew that I was watching it and I knew it was watching me.  It moved left to right and right to left, upward and inward, then came to a dead stop.  It was about 2-3 houses high and hovered just by the brim of the tree tops.  Then, suddenly, it started to back upward slowly real high like a dot in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I thought &#34;Oh, is a plane coming?&#34; yet there was no sound.  Then I heard a plane, and it passed over in front of it.  After it passed, guess what?  The ufo came slowly back down, right in the same exact spot in front of my house!   By this time it was a few minutes after 6am or 1800, as I ran to try to find my camera, I don&#39;t own a camcorder. Franticly, and unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t locate it.  (Later that day, I found it in the spot I was looking).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband was sleeping on the couch and I tried to wake him up twice, for some unknown reason I couldn&#39;t wake him.  Back down the stairs I go. It was glowing from behind it a bluish and amber color and there was a red dot to the right of it.  The neighbors were leaving for work and yet didn&#39;t see this!  Then I had the idea to see if I could play with it, because that’s how close it was and I felt a connection with it.  I started bending my body in different directions at the waist, and each time the ufo would move in that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The feeling that overwhelmed me was a feeling of love, understanding and peace and just an abundant amount of love to the point tears started rolling down my cheeks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I thought, &#34;Stop playing with my head and show me your craft.&#34;  I heard a hummmmm and then it stopped, and the white ufo came even down closer below the tree line and between the roofs of my neighbors two houses and poooff, out of the white came a boomerang craft &#34;straight forward&#34; and &#34;flipped&#34; on its side (as if you were making a peace sign with your fingers).  Let me tell you, I remember it happened so quickly, that I gasped!  Then I said &#34;Thank you, you have a very nice craft now don&#39;t hurt yourself.&#34; (lol). I know it sounds crazy, but it’s the gods honest truth. I used &#39;rule of thumb, to measure&#39; at arms width.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then after standing on its side and me eyeballing it for a good minute or so, like it was showing me its metallic etched craft it flipped back down and went backwards and into a white light again. AMAZING. It backed up, going higher and higher in the SAME spot as it did when the plane passed over, and out of sight. Since that sighting I have seen numerous crafts and strange sightings that would knock your socks off. I&#39;m so glad I finally found a website for Missouri sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional information: I forgot to mention something that may be of importance to document. After my sighting, my eyes were burning, inside and outside. I spoke of this to my family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night I took my glasses off and my daughter and law let out a yell, &#34;Oh my God, your eyes are all pink&#34; I looked in the mirror and low and behold ALL around my eye lids and corners of eyes looked as if they were sun burned. My girlfriend said that the red light I saw on the craft must have been some sort of laser, and that they gave me a lasor treatment; for the next week after that I was seeing &#34;Colors&#34; HUGE blots of burgandy and black while sitting on my patio, everywhere I looked. So, I went to the eye doctor, told him of the incident. He gave me every test available and said that it was unbelievable that there was no change in my right eye which I am legally blind in, usually it disintegrates at a rapid pace. To be honest it felt like I could see better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report received by Missouri Investigators Group - http://ufomig.bravehost.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP, and to its Director, BARBARA BECKER, for their having shared this report with our Center.

There is a big empty yard in our aparment complex and we heard some loud rustling noises back there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was approaching the empty lot an unindetifed object took off in a white flash into the dark nightfall.   It flew off too fast for me to identify what it was.  It&#39;s like it was attacking something back there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day during daylight I went back there to check for any evidence that might have been left behind.  I don&#39;t know what that could have been, but as far as I know it wasn&#39;t from earth.<n>
