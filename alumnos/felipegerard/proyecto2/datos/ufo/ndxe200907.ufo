7/31/09 23:45|Mississauga (Canada)|ON|Unknown|20-25 seconds|Approx 17 orange lights in triangular pattern|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71437.html|1|ndxe200907| Approx 17 orange lights in triangular pattern<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night my husband and I were out in our pool for a late night swim. It was a cloudless night and the stars were out. We had our lights all turned off to enjoy the night sky. We had come out around 11:35 pm and had been in the pool about five to ten minutes when I noticed lights in the sky coming over the house behind us.  At first I thought it was a plane, because our house is in a flight path. They were in a distinct triangular shape that in some ways mimicked that of a fighter jet&#39;s elongated triangle--  but the lights made a triangular shape that was bigger than a plane, you could see sky through and around them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were small orange points of light, and looked extraordinarily similar to the smallest stars we could see in the sky except of course that they were moving, and fast, flying in what appeared almost like a perfect flock of geese formation, except with two rows instead of one. I instantly pointed them out to my husband and we watched them as they passed almost directly overhead and past our house from Northwest to Southeast. There was no sound whatsoever either before, during or after they passed, other than that of the usual street traffic nearby, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we realized they were separate lights and not a single plane, I was honestly afraid they might  be missiles of some kind, because they were so small and high and going so fast,  their color was so uniform, and there was no sound.  Honestly, I have no idea whether missiles make noise or not, but it&#39;s all my mind could come up with at the time.   Also as they passed one of the tiny dots of light moved out of the V formation and away and then back into it.   They continued on in their straight path until they disappeared over the roof of our house. The whole thing only lasted 20-25 seconds or so traveling from the horizon of one rooftop to the horizon of the opposite rooftop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There seems to me to be absolutely no question that what we saw was not a natural event, but a group of-- I have no idea what. I am completely at a loss. But those orange lights were most definitely in a formation, and wherever they were going, they were going fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never reported anything like this before in my life until today. Would love to know what it was we saw.<n>

A few of us as we were looking to the west across the Bay. Happen to notice two differant lights in the distance criss crossing.  The South to North lights resembled the typical plane flashing in the area that we see nightly.  The second set of lights coming directly toward us from the west to the east looked odd.  The flashing appeared to bright of a red nature to be a planes marking lights.  All of us got out of our chairs,and stood near the edge of the dock to get a better veiw.  The object was approaching at a slow rate of speed, approximately around 2000 feet just above the two small clouds in the area.  The object was amber in color, with the front of it flashing more.  Almost like the flashs were like scanning side to side. As the object came over the bay.  It&#39;s speed slowed to a complete stop directly over us.  Then th! e amber color started to dim. As this occurred.  The object started upward turning more white in color.  This thing took off upwards faster than anything I have ever seen before.  Then just like snapping your finger, gone!  No smoke!  No outline shape.  No Pics or Vidio<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Not ISS.  PD))<n>

It had 1 yellow light on it. I watched it for several minutes. I then watched as it came closer and lowered altitude at the same speed. Looking as if it was hovering downward now. This object was several thousand feet up, but very visable. There were other objects in the sky at that time. But only 1 was strobing blue and white lights very fast. Back and forth, back and forth. And then they left after about 10 minutes or so. I had 1 more person witness exactly what I saw, and two others that saw the yellow light in the sky. Just a day before I witnessed a blinking red object that stopped on a dime and did a 180 turn. It was reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source of alleged sightings of UFO&#39;s.  Telephone number provided by source of report is bogus.  PD))<n>

I observed what appeared to be a trapazoidal object that was slowly moving from west to east.  It was the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length. It was colored grey and had an opaque quality to it as you could make out the clouds outlines behind the object.  It was about thirty five degrees above the horizon.  A forty second stop at a traffic light confirmed its slow movement.  Visual contact was lost after a curve brought a line of trees obscuring my vision and I could no longer located the object after the tree line ended.  Imagine one half of a  box kite floating in the air, that&#39;s what I compare to what I saw.<n>

As I was driving, I noticed what looked like a commuter jet flying at about 3000 feet.  As I kept driving, I noticed it wasn&#39;t moving very fast.  I continued driving east up the hill on King Sdrd. and noticed that it wasn&#39;t moving whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept driving for about a minute, stopped on the side of the road, got out of the car, grabbed a pair of binoculars I always keep in my car and started looking at it.  I estimated that it was traveling at about 50 miles/hr.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching it through my binoculars, it had no tail, just wings. Underneath, it had about 15 yellow and orange lights.  There was no sound, it was just quietly humming.  As it was going by, I got back in my car, turned it around and started driving west with it, thinking that I could maybe catch up to it.  However, by then, a few cars had gone by and were in front of me.  This made it difficult for me to catch up to it. I returned to Highway 27 and by then it was maybe a mile ahead of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate that in about 2 1/2 minutes, it had traveled maybe 4 miles.  I&#39;ve traveled on various planes - from a concorde to a jumbo jet and it certainly wasn&#39;t anything I have seen before.  The entire sighting lasted about 2 1/2 minutes, had that been any kind of airplane, it would&#39;ve have traveled at least 20-30 miIes.  I have no idea what it was, but I&#39;m certain it wasn&#39;t an airplane or a helicopter.<n>
7/31/09 01:00|Vassar|MI|Circle|3 minutes|orange ball seen hovering over trees along Sohn Road in Vassar Michigan|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71479.html|11|ndxe200907| orange ball seen hovering over trees along Sohn Road in Vassar Michigan<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello, I am a 31 year old male originally from the town of Vassar, Michigan.  Me and most of my friends have had UFO experiences either on or near Sohn Road in Vassar.  In fact, I use to live on Sohn Road until March of 2000.  I have seen some crazy stuff while living on that road!!  Mostly circle shaped lights at night/early morning.  Some orange, some white, and some that even changed colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had two experiences in the past month to month and a half while driving down Sohn Road in assar, Michigan. Both experiences were with an orange colored circle. The more recent experience happened on Friday, July 31 of 2009 at about 1:00 am in the morning as I was returning home from a friends house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading down Sohn Road (from Vassar heading towards Frankenmuth) when I approached the &#34;S&#34; curve.  Anyone who has ever driven down Sohn Road knows what curve I am talking about. The road curves to the left, dips down and then back up, and then curves to the right.  As I came from the &#34;dip&#34; and started to turn to the right again, I noticed an orange ball just above the tree line beyond the farm field to the left of the road.  I stopped my car in the middle of the road so I could get a better look.  It was not moving, or blinking, nor was it making any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought that it might have been a satellite or something similar to a satellite, so I started to take off down the road again. That is when things got really strange for me. The orange ball started to move too. As I am driving down the road, I noticed that the orange ball is moving with my car. I stopped my car in the road again, and the orange ball stopped too. I said to myself that I needed to get the f**k out of there, so I started to drive down the road quite fast. As I am speeding (literally) down Sohn Road, I can see (through the trees) this orange ball staying right with my car. My heart was pounding!! As I came to the next curve (there was/is a chiropractor&#39;s office on the left side of the road) and to an open area, there was no sign of the orange ball at all. I even stopped my car and looked all around. The orange ball disappeared!!<n>

As I looked across the horizon, I seen 2 light&#39;s in front of the clouds.  One was above and to the right of the moons light through the clouds.  One was to the lower left.   As i watched I realized they were two far off clusters of five or more.  I called my roommate, she came outside.  Then one turned bright red and shot straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that we continued watch several more break off one by one, and take off into random directions. And never in a straight line.  If i were to draw it would be A squiggle.  We seen a flash that came from behind the clouds, and directly behind the upper right cluster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 22:40 the lower left cluster ran out.  Then minutes later the upper right fallowed.  So we came in and i phoned my dad and brother.  I went out again at 23:00 and seen one formation.  It was higher in the sky and it stayed in that spot, as long as i was awake.  But before i did go to bed, i seen a object streak across the sky from east to west.  West being where all the formation&#39;s were from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could have been a meteor.  But given the surcomstances and the direction it was going, it could have been one of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I phoned my brother and he seen the last cluster, and described it as being a ring shape of lights.  He has less street lights, and is 3 kilometers south of me.  I Watched until I got tired and eventually went to bed.<n>

It didn&#39;t move very fast, but made no sound that we could hear, and the entire object was a bright orange light.  So bright, it reflected off the lake.  It continued straight North, then turned a bit westward, directly away from us, until it faded from view.  Total time around 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Was out there for about 30 minutes I&#39;d say.  Then saw a red light in the distance. Northeast of where I was standing. It was very low and relatively close to where I was.  At it&#39;s closest I&#39;d say it was probably about 1/2 mile to a mile away and maybe just 100 feet off the ground.  It was blinking red.  And they were kind of mediocre timed intervals, almost kind of reminded me of a persons breaklight if they were to delay each compression for a couple seconds.  It kind of went up and down a bit within very short distances which was different for my eyes to see. I watched it not gain very high altitude at all.  It stayed really low to the ground around the area. I got my mom to show her.  And she watched it with me, and I couldt tell she knew that it was different. It finally came to a holt for just a second or so.  I watched it as it had vertually sit still in the air.  This is when the object blinked 1 blue light w! ithin it&#39;s red light.  And then it turned around, 180 degrees on that dime. Which was pretty amazing really.  Uh, I was very excited to see this variance in whatever this thing was. I could not hear any sound, if it was a nearby local cessna I could of heard it&#39;s engine from it being so close.  I am correct with my time, so the airports the only one that could deny my sighting.  This was a really awesome sighting.  I haven&#39;t seen anything in the sky this intersting over the last 4-5 months that I would waste my time talking about.  As I am a consistent star/sky gazer. Really different type of lights on this thing.  The way it moved was pretty different.  I don&#39;t think this could be related to any type of other flying aircraft.  Here&#39;s another big thing as well.  For the distance it traveled and as close as it was, I&#39;d have to say this thing was moving at no more then 20-25 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source of alleged sightings of UFO&#39;s.

It travelled into some low clouds and disapeared from sight.  This object made no sound and travelled at a decent speed greater than that of the wind which to my estimation was blowing from the west to the east north east.  I cant gauge the size of the object as there was nothing in its flight path to lend some scale .<n>

There is a long straight-away following the hill leaving the store.  There were (2) disks(cigars, footballs...  whatever shape that is) could be seen directly through my front windshield.  They were stationary which is what caught my eye but in broad daylight?  There were fluffy white clouds and I watched as the clouds moved by these stationary disks.  The clouds covered them once and they re-appeared as the clouds moved past them.  I signaled to make my turn to go into Cross Plains, Texas, and lost there location due to my own change in direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was like a falling star, but it was moving fairly slow. Then it just stopped, and in no more than 30 seconds it was right above the car. It was definitely no airplane. It had 3 lights, and you could plainly see that it was triangle shape. It seemed to have a blinking red light either in the middle, or on the back of it? It was just unlike anything I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am in the DFW area, and the object was centered due North of my position, at approx 50-55 degree inclination, just North of the Little Dipper.  It appears as though the distance would be a spaced based object.  It was not the space station or the shuttle. I know what they look like when they pass over. I am 2 miles from an airport so I know what airplanes look like.  It definately glowed brightly for 3-4 seconds, then disappeared.  It actually moved, to what seemed like a Northern trajectory from it&#39;s original position.  I know this sounds crazy, but it just happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/28/09 20:45|Poway|CA|Disk|1 minute|Fireball and disk seen north of Poway, CA 92064  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS overflight at 20:43 hrs. on this date.  PD))|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71387.html|39|ndxe200907| Fireball and disk seen north of Poway, CA 92064<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: 12600 block of Robison Boulevard, Poway, CA 92064. Facing northwest, looking toward Rancho Bernardo. We came home at approximately 2045. I noticed that my wife and daughter were standing outside at the top of the stairs (2nd story apartment) looking in the aforementioned direction. I came back outside prior to the appearance of the objects. The objects were viewed in the same approximate vicinity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was initially looking at a large white bird (I believe that it was an owl, we do see those around here on rare occasions.) I was able to go outside in time to see the bird fly away from a tree just above the mountain horizon. Within 15 seconds of the birds departure, my wife and I witnessed what she described as a fireball moving at a very high speed across the horizon from east to west at perhaps a 20 degree angle, disappearing from view as it went behind the mountains. I witnessed a second object, described later in this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s my description of what I saw: The first initially looked like a meteor. I&#39;ve seen plenty of them. After a brief retrospective moment, it seemed odd because this had a distinctive shape and appeared to be much closer than a meteor. We both agreed that the first object did have a &#34;fireball&#34; quality to it, although it was not like anything we have ever seen before. She did not see the second object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I describe the second object as a rounded disk with a dull, white glow. It did look different than the other object, although the intensity of the light emitted from both objects was similar. The big difference is that I could see a clear disk-shaped outline to the second object. After a brief and partially witnessed vertical climb (partially obstructed by a tree), it went in to a downward dive at a tremendous speed. I&#39;m not qualified by any means to estimate the size or distance of the object, but if I was forced to render an opinion, I&#39;d say that this would be an object 100 feet in diameter at a distance of 10 miles from our viewpoint. That would certainly mean a low-flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a skeptic, I always love a good debunk. I was thinking about meteors and bird flocks, reflections on the birds and such.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The kicker: At 9:00PM, we heard the rumble of jet engines and witnessed two aircraft fly over the area where the objects were witnessed. They were cruising from west to east. This is an uncommon flight path. With the exception of distant commercial flights, we do not ever see military aircraft in that direction. These were jet fighters, I am confident that these were jet fighters, as I have lived near a military airbase for my entire life. I was very surprised to see this. We do have MCAS Miramar about ten miles in the opposite direction, they use a very specific flight path for training and have never to my knowledge done training that requires loud engine noise over civilian territory at night. They do have fighter jets ready to go at any moment, this is a well known fact, although I can&#39;t source it for you folks. Sorry!  The fighter jets were probably about 15-20 miles away from us and were flying at a low altitude, 8,000-10,000 feet. Please bear in mind that I am not an expert, this is just an estimate based upon my very limited base of knowledge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the first time that either of us had witnessed an event like this. We always hoped that it would happen some day, and this was quite unexpected. Possible debunks: The white bird/owl. We both agree that the first object was not possibly the aforementioned bird, as this was in a slightly different vicinity and looked nothing like a bird. Regarding the second object, I&#39;ve never seen any flying creature move like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw what we saw and did our best to transcribe it. We&#39;re hoping that somebody else witnessed this and can perhaps explain what we actually did see.<n>

It made a very loud noise when it hit the side of the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called 911 and the volunteer firefighters came out and looked around did&#39;t see anything and left.  About a half hour later the military showed up and went to the exact spot where it hit.  The strange thing was they did&#39;t ask us any questions they knew exactly where to go.

The moon now passed behind this cloud? The moon was blocked out, no longer could we see the moon through the cloud? As the moon continued passed this cloud?, the moon was very bright again. This cloud? was barely big enough to block out the moon from our perspective, it wasn&#39;t huge by any imagination. We watched the cloud evolve into another formation, looked like an open waffle iron, not moving from where this cloud originated from.....we all remarked at how weird this was. After 45 minutes or so, the cloud? dissipated into the sky and no longer exsisted.

7/27/09 23:30|Quetico Provincial Park (Canada)|ON|Light|thirty minutes|Three evenly spaced, very bright white lights in Eastern sky over Quetico Park that pulsated.|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71519.html|46|ndxe200907| Three evenly spaced, very bright white lights in Eastern sky over Quetico Park that pulsated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on a canoe camping trip last week, deep in the wilderness, with my wife and kids.  I was woken up by something really bright--saw three bright lights in the Eastern sky, evenly spaced, but absolutely not moving.  They seemed to me to be too low in the sky for a satellite, plus they were stationary.  The spacing, at that distance, seemed too bright for any manmade object I am familiar with (geosynchronous orbit).  After ten minutes the three lights began fading and glowing randomly, and continued doing so for over thirty minutes. When it went dark you could still see a sort of halo around the area, then the lights woud pulse back on--but not all at once, they sort of followed each other in their pulsations.   I went to sleep, too tired to continue watching.  I initially thought it might be the space station, solar arrays rotating in the sunlight, but then I found out later the space station orbits the earth and would have been moving--this held position! .  My wife and kids saw the whole thing, and my daughter saw it again the next night.  If I had to guess at a location it would be 60-80 miles south of Atikokan, ONT.  Still, it could have been a man-made object I suppose.  But it was unusual enough that I have been doing a little websearching on this subject and now I am not so sure it was man-made.  I did hear a commercial jet aircraft fly by at the time north of my position.  Maybe they saw it too. I screwed up by not filming it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  Expresses preference to not be contacted.

As I was approaching the local elementary school, toward the North, I could see a large light sort of hovering in the sky.

One thing was clear: the light was too large to be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t keep my eyes off the light, as it was so bright it could be seen through patches of trees.  The light was round and had a yellowish tint to it.  I continued to track the light until I lost sight of it, almost as if it had left my horizon.  The experience lasted about a minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Briefly after, I tried to call my father.  When I connected to his phone, I heard muffled background noise.  I listened as long as I could bear before I was too freaked out to continue.  I called my father again, and when I connected, he claimed that I had not gone through to his phone.  I’m not sure if there was some type of electrical interference, but I have never had any type of call quite like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My hometown, Exeter, NH, is known for some of its encounters with UFO’s.

7/27/09 21:30|Bonneville Salt Flats (Salt Lake City)|UT|Sphere|10 minutes|Bonneville Salt Flats, July 09, Investigator, Bright White Lights, Semi-Circle, Pulsations, Motorcycle|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73321.html|51|ndxe200907| Bonneville Salt Flats, July 09, Investigator, Bright White Lights, Semi-Circle, Pulsations, Motorcycle<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an investigator for MUFON and the state of IL.  I purchased a bike in Reno on Monday 7/27/09, and was driving back to St. Louis on I-80 on Monday night.  I had just crossed over the Utah border and saw the Bonneville Salt Flats exit sign on I-80.  The wind was blowing about 30 knots, which caused my bike to lean as I drove at about 80 miles per hour.  It was dark, very few if any clouds, dry and the conditions were nominal except for the tremendous wind from the north blowing southward.   I was also wearing a helmet, full face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking up at all the stars and the blinking lights of many airplanes traversing the sky as I drove towards Salt Lake City to find a hotel room for the night.  As I was driving, I was thinking, this is the area where there are many UFO sightings.  About then, a white light then appeared to my right (S-SE) at very high altitude at about my 40 degree position.  I estimate the altitude and distance to be 15,000 feet at 10 to 15 miles out.  Why?   Because it was about halfway from horizon to where the strobes of airplanes were flashing; therefore, 10 to 15 thousands feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it shown its single light, it appeared to be a plane with a running light, breaking through the clouds--in other words, it had a halo-like effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dismissed this as a plane, even though there were very few clouds directly above me; however, at that distance there could have been more clouds in its position, obviously. As I drove, the ultra bright white light descended and was moving towards me. About 1 to 2 minutes later, the light appeared again, altitude this time much lower and much closer than before, maybe 8 to 10 miles from my starboard, same position. This repeatedly happened about every 2 minutes, the light would power up, shine in my direction, then it slowly turn off, as if were a river barge light powering off. It didn&#39;t just switch off, it phased down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking in my rearview mirror thinking that the light should eventually cross the road behind me since it was on a 90 degree angle to me and heading in my same direction. At some point, I should have traveled east of it&#39;s trajectory towards Salt Lake City moving past it’s heading to the north since we were on a perpendicular intersect, but that never happened. The light lit up about 6 to 7 times, each time it was closer, brighter, lower and especially disturbing, it was always in the same 40 to 45 degree position to me as when I first viewed it. Logically that meant, I thought, that the light was somehow keeping pace with me, which became disturbing.  I was extremely compelled to continue to look on that same starboard heading of south, south-east to try and figure out what this aircraft could be. I couldn&#39;t decide which was more interesting, the fact that it was getting closer to me, or the fact that it was always in the same bearing to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 6 sequential events of the light turning on and then off, duration each time as being about 3 to 5 seconds, it then was at its closest distance to me, about 1 mile or less. What happened next was absolutely exhilarating and I will never forget it, and this event then caused me to completely dismiss my original assumption of an airplane or helicopter and/or the characteristics of a man made craft that I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second to the last time of this sighting the light shown at me, very close, one mile or less and at this time it continued to stay on. One to two seconds later, two other lights to its left came on along with it, same luminosity, same distance, moving with me but NOT horizontally symmetrical to each other. They were all three equidistant to each other, but the middle one was at a higher elevation than the other two making it appear to me as a very flat pyramidal grouping of three white, brilliant, lights about 1 mile away from me. Now I could actually see the craft moving with me, matching my speed, as the light(s) stayed on much longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was never any beam of any sort that I could see, and I looked to see if the white salt below the craft became illuminated because of these lights. It did not. Just brilliant white lights off to my 40 to 45 degree bearing each time. The lights didn’t appear to illuminate my bike either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the closest point to me, I estimate the altitude to now be about 600 to 1,000 feet at a distance of no more than 1 mile from me, if even that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, the three lights all turned off at the same time, slowly vaporizing down, like a river   barge&#39;s lights. There was no sound.  My bike didn’t loose power or suffer any electrical failures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, I now assumed these lights to be directly pointing at me for some reason. This craft was intentionally pointing these lights at me.  I somehow felt that this sighting was now more of a personal experience and not just some random lights. There was too much evidence of this now for me to dismiss.  I always saw stars in the background as if these lights were not a part of any solid craft or solid sphere. They appeared independent of each other but always uniformly symmetrical in their formation and distance, except, as I reported, for the slightly flattened pyramidal characteristic described above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time it shown on me was amazing! That same single light appeared one last time, same heading to me, same distance and same altitude as before. From a distance of about half a mile away, I saw what looked like brilliant LCD lights, orange-ish/red-ish in color, lights SCROLLING from behind the light/object, arcing up and to the left in a huge semi circle, and as it came around the circle towards the front of the craft, I could see even more of the colored lights scrolling around the circumference of a huge, circular disk.  But it was only a half disk and it was tilted left side up and right side down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 6 to 10 of these very fast pulsations of brilliantly colored lights came from the exact same spot behind the light, circled around a huge disk shaped object and then came in to full view to me, larger and brighter and then abruptly ended at the white light that was still showing at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was one giant pulse of about 6 to 8 individual scrolling lights which made the outline of a circular half disk. But the disk was on a tilt slightly, about 15 degrees, so the lights went slightly up, over and downward and then abruptly ended at the white light that had stayed on the entire time, about 10 to 12 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so shocked by this......I pulled the bike over on the shoulder of the highway. The wind was so fast, it nearly blew it over. I was speechless at what I had just seen and was hoping for it to appear to me again so I could video tape it with my blackberry phone, but it never did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some time went by as I had resumed riding and the light never appeared close to me again. However, I saw the light one more time off in the distance.  It had flown back towards the Bonneville salt flats again in the distance and I last saw it just above the horizon, very far from me, south, where it illuminated one more time looking very much like a helicopter showing its lights on the desert floor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t seem hostile in any way.....moreover, it seemed to want to show me that it was not a plane or helicopter that I kept insisting it was in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It revealed its disk shape, 180 degrees of a half circle, in the most brilliant orange and red pulsations of light I have ever seen.  It was the same color as a cutting torch, maybe. I could always see stars behind it, but the pulses did reveal a huge semi-circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had not been drinking, I wasn’t tired nor was I on any kind of medication or drugs of any kind. I was just enjoying my ride home.  There’s definitely something weird at the Bonneville Salt Flats, in Utah?<n>

A few seconds later my son cried out, &#34;What is that?&#34;.  Looking up into the sky I saw a circular object with 6 lights near the edge.  As I recall there were 2 red lights near the front, 2 white lights near the middle and 2 green lights near the back.  The craft was moving from east to west and I was facing north. The craft appeared to be white or silver and was maybe 400-500 feet above us (guesstimate).  The craft was moving at a steady pace/quickly across the sky.  I was baffled as to what the object was and went to get my sister.  The same type of craft was seen again at approx. 21:45 but at a higher altitude.<n>

I was standing and looking at the stars and noticed a bright red light to the west of where i was standing which I thought was a planet.  I looked around the sky and realized it was too big to be a planet.  I looked back at the red object and saw it was getting closer to me.  It was flying low and was a disk or saucer shape.  It was a bright white light on the outside and red on the inside of the disk.  Inside the red circle of light was another white object that I would call a ship.  It was like a squared off upside down heart shape.  I realized that what I was seeing was a UFO.  It came towards me and traveled very slowly.  It made NO sound.  It passed me and was to the east of me when I could see the front end of the disk begin to ascend.  It then shot straight upward and eastward and was out of sight in ! less than 2 seconds.  I was not scared and it was the most awesome thing I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It almost seem to pulsate. The light wasn&#39;t a very large light,but was slightly larger than that of a passenger plane.The lighted object came to a near dead stop,just kind of wobbled and then changed it&#39;s direction from due north to due east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this took only 40 or 50 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then got everyone out of the house and when we got back out of the house the object was still very close and was still moving due east.  We then watched the object move off very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 2 minutes of watching the object,it just seemed to take off at a unreal speed.The reason i say this is that the object went from a large object in the sky to a very small one in just seconds.  And just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after,20seconds or so.

I was in a parking lot surrounded by considerably open space.  To the north I noticed a light heading SW at the speed of an airplane.  The light looked only slightly bigger than Venus, and actually just looked like a travelling bigger star.  There was no pulsating, just a constant moving white light.  In about 90 seconds of observing, I heard the running of something with the sound of tennis shoes; which suddenly stopped or disappeared as soon as I looked in its direction followed by an evanescent light relation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed in addition, that when I looked at this travelling light in the sky from the side of my eye, there appeared to be a long beam stretching seemingly all the way back.  However, this sight was quickly lost, and could not be seen straight on.  I tested this 5-6 times, and everytime I got the same result.  About 1-2 minutes later, I saw the light qucikly dim.  Then a few seconds later the light disappeared completely with no help of clouds.  This was the only msytical aspect of the experience, everything seemed rational albeit unexplained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS overflight at 21:27 hrs.  PD))<n>

Due to surrounding trees, we were only able to see it for about 5 seconds.  It was an amazing experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and employment deleted)) teacher; ((name deleted)), business owner<n>

I had not seen it the first time my brother and mother and two other people saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a large round object that was hollow in the middle - think of a metal washer (for a nut &amp; bolt) and you have a good idea what the object looked like.  It appeared to me to be silver in color but my brothers thought it was black and the sun reflecting off it made it look silver.  It made no noise that I could hear and traveled slowly, well below the few low clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran down the street to try to keep the object in sight and were able to go about 2 blocks before it went over a mountain and we lost sight of it.  While we were following it down the street I noticed another darker object directly above the silver &#34;washer&#34; object.  It was much higher up and difficult to see any details but it stayed right above the silver washer.  After I lost the silver washer over the mountain the other darker object was still visible and then we saw a second darker object that was lower than the first dark object but higher than the washer.  After all three of those objects disappeared we saw a fourth object, shaped like a puffy boomarang is the best way to describe it.  It was lower than the other objects and followed the same course until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother got a few pictures with a disposable camera that we will get developed tomorrow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was partly cloudy, temperatures in the mid-70s, and it was about 6:45 p.m. so it was still daylight.<n>

We had just finished a game, and I looked into the sky and observed the first 3 UFOs.  All three were traveling in a northeastern direction, in a group.  The largest craft was a black circle, which I have seen before from the location (see my report here dated 6/17/2007).  The other 2 crafts were following the same trajectory and in a group with the circle.  They were smaller, but not circle-shaped.  Because of the distance, I could not make out a shape.  All were traveling fast, and the circle tipped to its side while filing, exposing the empty space in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were tracking the group of 3, a 4th UFO flew in the same direction.  It followed approximately 10 minutes behind the original group.  I was able to use binoculars to view this one.  It was shaped like a kidney, although its edges were straight lines, not curved as one would usually think of a kidney.  At the part of the ship where the kidney&#39;s &#34;indent&#34; would be, there were lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Skies were cloudy with rain clouds, although it was not raining.  The ships flew both in front of and through the clouds, and were moving away from us duringf the incident.  I did not get as good a view as my original sighting 2 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were able to take a few photographs of all of the UFOs, but it was a disposible camera at a distance.  The film will be developed tomorrow.<n>

My mother, older brother, older sister and two young nephews were all present.  While playing the game, my older brother said “UFO” and we thought he was trying to be funny (he had previously seen and reported a UFO sighting with additional family members approximately 2 years ago; I had not been present at the time of that sighting).  He said he was serious and we all looked and saw what he had noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a ring-shaped object in the sky that, at least twice while I was viewing it, rotated on its axis to show its top.  When showing the top of itself, it could be viewed that the center was completely open, allowing an unobstructed view of the sky behind it.  This object appeared about the size of a dime (to make a relative size comparison) and was approximately 45 degrees from the horizon.  It was about 6:30PM, the sun was behind us and the sky was slightly cloudy; the object appeared to be no more than 1000 feet off the ground, well below cloud cover.  The object appeared black but when it would rotate the top would appear to be silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Accompanying this ring shaped object were 2 dark circular objects.  They were roughly a quarter of the size of the ring-shaped object and one was positioned directly above it, I’d estimate 60 degrees from the horizon; the second was behind and off to the right of the first.  Admittedly, I did not pay much attention to these as I was concentrating on the ring-shaped object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As these three objects moved out of sight range (they never became obscured by objects, they just became too distant to see; this took about 5 minutes from the time we initially spotted them) I happened to look back in the direction the objects had come from and saw a fourth object.  This one was kidney shaped with the curve to the front and wobbled a lot as it moved.  The curved section appeared to be white or a light color, the rest of the object was black.   It went in the same direction as the other objects.  This kidney-shaped object I would also estimate at about 45 degrees from the horizon and moving at approximately the same speed as the other three craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> None of these four objects emitted any noise or contrail or exhaust of any sort.  I could not notice any visible lights on them.  They all moved slower than an airplane or helicopter would.  All were headed in a southeasterly direction; there was a light breeze that was intermittently coming from the northwest.<n>

The object was probably about the size of a house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was stationary for about 35 seconds, it flew straight up into the clouds.  I could see it disappearing through the clouds with the affect of a flashlight shining in smoke.  I found it very werid because airplanes always fly from east to west over my house and this was coming from the south going north.  And I don&#39;t think there is an aircraft known to have a flight pattern like I saw that evening.<n>

This was BRIGHT, brighter than any other plane, jet or star in the sky. There was no sound at all, and there were no red/green lights. This was about the brightness of Venus in the winter when it is at its brightest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watch for planes all the time, and this was definitely not the typical brightness.

At first glance the object appeared to be a bright star or planet about SSW and about 30 degrees above the horizon, but after a second glance it was obvious it was much too bright. It was at least 10-20 times brighter than the north star. My friend came out and agreed it was definitely something unusual.  It didn&#39;t appear to move but after a few moments observing it I noticed it looked like it was flickering occasionally.  In order to get a closer look, I went inside as soon as I got home and grabbed my digital camera, only 1.3 megapixel and no optical zoom.  It didn&#39;t get me the close-up detail I was hoping for, but after I got inside and transferred the pictures to my computer I was astonished to discover that the object was in a completely different and seemingly random location in each one of the shots (about 10 in all) and it also left a significant light trail, or motion blur, in e! very shot. This was very surprising to me since the object APPEARED to stay in one spot when viewed with the naked eye.  Each one of the pictures is shot about 2-3 seconds apart.  My only explanation is that it is moving too fast for the human eye to detect which is why it APPEARS to be motionless, but the pictures prove otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw a bright, glowing green diamond with an elongated top appear out of nowhere.  It was the brightest green we have ever seen, as if you were to melt down a neon sign and shape it into that elongated diamond shape.  But at the same time the shape was so crisp you could clearly see the distinctness of each curve and point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then changed in almost a liquid manner to a bright glowing circle of yellow light.  This too was an unbelievably bright yellow light that glowed like a neon sign.  It was a perfect crisp circle.  I’ve never seen colors so vibrant Then finally it changed into a tiny point of incredibly bright light which flashed and then the whole thing was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was large, I would guess larger than a commercial airplane, and significantly higher.  Throughout the event it was totally silent and took only about 3 seconds, leaving us both scared and questioning what had just happened.  We stayed there for a while to see if anything else would come back, but nothing did.  Ill never forget that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were multiple households watching, I know that because when we would scream a little they would too.  We would literally jump like you would when something loud scares you, but it was the lights that were terrifying.  First off let me say that not only have my friends and I lived in this town for our whole lives, 2 of us, including me grew up looking at the very mountain range we saw this happen on.  This WAS NOT normal activity.  There are some oil lease roads, and the California Condor Sanctuary is right on the other side of the mountain.  These lights were hovering together almost like a boat tucked away in a cove.  These mountains have basically sheer cliff faces, and just unimaginable terrain.  I mention this because these lights were perfectly even with one another across a great span of the mountain, with incredibly bright white light that would app! ear much more to the left of the lights that caught our attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the first to notice them, we had just BBQ’d some burgers, and brought my friends little fire pit into the back of his yard. The reason we did was because this is a rural area right outside the town and there is far less light pollution so the stars would be brighter. My two other friends were talking, and I was away from the fire and looking up and what caught my eye first, and was my proving point in  getting people to look at what I was saying, was the brightest blue LED type of light I have ever seen. Then there were two white lights that flashed, and then a red one on the left. These are the lights that we continued to see. But it was a vast array of flashes, and faint lights, all perfectly even across the cliff faces. It was so amazing, I had to go get my girlfriend out of bed at around midnight to come and watch. We live about a mile from where we first saw it, and on the drive down I saw the lights the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is what scared us: the lights were in a flat line 98% of the time flashing and glowing the most incredible white lights you could ever see. I’m familiar with off road lights that are at between 250,000 and 1,000,000 candle power, and these were so bright at that range it would be like staring into a welder’s arc flame at 10 feet. These lights when you shut your eyes you could still see them. But then lights behind lit up and you could perfectly see a huge disc shape. There were two rings of light, a smaller ring on the top that was a perfect disc shape, and the large ring of lights was a perfect disc shape as well. We could never see the shape until it lit up in all directions, and it floated up, spun itself around about half a rotation, moved back a little then went back down. All of us were scared to our core. We all screamed and were VERY scared. The lights continued on for another 2 hours after  that, but it never lit up again like it did when we COULD CLEARLY SEE ! A LIT UP DISC SHAPE IN THE SKY THAT MOVED.	 There were 6 adults and one 8 year old kid that saw what we were seeing, where we saw it. Everyone there would talk to anyone you’d like to send out. I called 911 and the police told me that it was a Sheriff problem; I called the Sheriff and was told it was a local police problem. Dogs throughout the valley were barking, people were outside smoking cigarettes watching this, kids were walking down the street in packs and asking me if I saw it too. If you start knocking on some doors here, I think you would find that maybe 50 or 100 people, probably more, saw what we saw. My dogs were in the front in my truck, and I would go check on them because they were very nervous, by the way they are good sized Pit Bulls that are afraid of nothing, and they were scared. I believe all the animals were. There is a good amount of livestock running around up on the mountains and on all the surrounding ranches, but oddly enough I didn’t hear a horse whinny or a cow moo, not once. Two Ventura ! County Sheriff’s cars flew by me a very high rate of speed, and flashed a side light at me, I had a big 4 cell LED Mag Light, and I flashed at them, but they just kept going.  It was very surreal, and at times terrifying. Please come and investigate this. Contact me anytime day or night.<n>

At around 10:45pm, for some reason, I looked up at the sky and noticed 3 orange lights in the sky.  They were in a triangle formation.  The light on the left point faded out.  The light on the right point started to slowly rise up towards the top point.  At this time, my husband got up and stood next to me.  I asked him if he was seeing what I was and he said yes.  We watched the left point rise until it passed the top point.  Then the top point faded out.  About a minute later, still rising, and brighter than before, the last point (which was on the right in the beginning) faded out.  We didn’t see anything else the rest of the night.  The sky was clear and as we were at the lake, there were no city lights nearby and there are no commercial air routes over the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is 48 years old, a HVAC technician and high school graduate.  I am 38 years old! , a paralegal and college graduate.  Neither of us had been drinking or anything else at that point.   We did afterwards, though.<n>

Above the sports field near my flat i saw four lights in a diamond formation, they were bright white in colour and next to this shape were another two lights on the right hand side of the diamond shape.  They were the same colour and size of the one&#39;s forming the diamond shape.  There was no noise at all.  After 30 seconds or so it changed to a square shape with the two lights remaining in the same position.  After a couple of minutes all the lights completly vanished.  There was light cloud cover that night but the lights were in a clear patch of sky and did not go behind a cloud.I watched the sky for ten minutes after the dissapearance ofthe lights and nothng re-appeared.<n>

The object first appeared to be higher than the hills but soon completely dropped out of view, only to then go vertical, and then change directions again going left to right and then right to left at a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be the size of a star, with light colors ranging from mainly white to red as well as green. The object would change directions almost at an instance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called out 2 other witnesses from my house to confirm what I was seeing.  Event lasted approx 10 min.  I also contacted a local ATC facility and they said nothing unusual spotted.<n>

I went to get something from my car that is parked just outside my house, but before I reached my car I looked up at the sky as I saw a bright orange/red circle in the sky, at first I thought it was a firework and waited for the bang but as I watched it for about 20 more seconds I couldn’t identify what it was so called to my husband who was in the house to come out, he watched it for about another 20 seconds and also could not explain it either, I asked him to film it on his mobile phone as I know he always carries it with him!  He recorded it for 1 min and 1 sec until his camera could not pick it up anymore but we watched it until it went out of sight!!  It looked like a circle of solid orange/red light, bigger than a aeroplane light or star, I could not see any mass around the light, it was just the circle of light.  It went across the sky under clouds at the same speed , at the same altitude and in a straight line.  It was not an aeroplane, helicopter as there was no noise from it as all! Something travelling at this speed should have some kind of noise to it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we were still trying to find some explanation, we checked to see if it could have been the international space station but that was over New Zealand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS passed overhead at 21:24 hrs..

One of the witnesses had time to look out of a vehicle window when the other two individuals shouted &#34;look at that!&#34;  This object was larger and brighter than any star or planet I have ever seen.  The moon is the only thing which ever appears in the night sky which is brighter than this object.  It was a single, brilliant white light with a starburst appearance.  There were no sounds or blinking lights associated with this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most disturbing thing about this object was how it went away.  The light faded to black.  It appeared to fade down to nothing just like someone had turned down a dimmer switch or if this object had moved away from us at an unbelievable speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have observed many meteor showers and aircraft over the years and have never seen anything remotely as strange and disturbing as this object.<n>

A female neighbor accross the street yelled at me, pointing at the northern sky and stated &#34;What is that?&#34; I immediately looked up and saw 20 to 30 bright yellowish disk-shaped objects, each with an illuminated vertical red center, flying accross the sky with no detectable sound. They were moving west to east about 40 degrees off the horizon at what appeared to be a high rate of speed. They were in a straight formation, although about 30 seconds into this encounter 2 or 3 seemed to &#34;break off&#34; from the formation and head south towards me for a few seconds, then quickly joined the others in their easterly trek.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was watching this, the female neighbor&#39;s husband also came out of his house and joined his wife and I, who were watching this spectacle from the street. After another minute or so, the objects all disappeared into the eastern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 56 year old college-educated male, who spent over 20 years in law enforcement in several different positions. I am currently an in-town truck driver, and I do not use illicit drugs or cosume alcohol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can offer no logical explanation as to what these objects were that my neighbors and I saw. I hope to find out something about this when I watch the evening news at 11:00 p.m. tonight.  Finally, if someone would have told me I would be making a report to a UFO center, I would have laughed at them. I occasionally listen to &#34;Coast to Coast&#34; on the radio and always regarded UFO reports as just some type of goofy entertainment. Now I&#39;m not so sure!At 10<n>

The sun was almost completly set, there was still very little light in the sky, and it was partially cloudy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw them go up into the clouds to the east and basically dissapeared in to them.<n>

I noticed to the north a light that was heading south east. This light was white.  I watched it for a few seconds and then remarked to my husband, “look at the light, but it does not appear to be a plane, it has no blinking lights”. The light was lower than a satellite…but because it was a way in front of me it appeared to be airplane height. The light went off to the east and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove into our driveway got out of the car, my husband went into the house to let the dogs out and I stood there. I looked up and from the north came a red light toward me. I called to my husband “look”. We both watched the light approach us, it appeared to be low, and it was red, round, not blinking and no sound. Its size was bigger than a star….medical helicopter size. We watched 15 seconds or so as it headed in a south east direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to walk the dogs to the north looked up and there was another light.  I called to my husband “its back”….it came from the north, red, low, round, no sound, not blinking…flying steady. It headed in a south east direction above me. Same dimensions as the first light….really identical. Both sightings from the house were just a few minutes apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS.  PD))<n>

The object then begain to pick up speed and begian to turn to the east and either speeded up to the point you couldn&#39;t see it or it just faded away.

At first, I took it to be a satellite, and I went inside to get my wife. While she was coming outside, I noticed that it was much too bright and much too fast to be a satellite.  It was not moving as fast as a shooting star, but it was definitely moving more quickly than any satellite I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife came outside, and we watched it slowly fade into a shade of red before fading completely.  We lost sight of it for a few seconds before spotting either a second similar object or the same object a good distance away from where we originally saw it.  Whether it was the same object or a second object, it behaved the same with it fading into a shade of red before totally fading.

While sitting in our lawn chairs, facing due east, we  were scanning the sky but no really looking for anything.  It was relatively clear night with just a few low level clouds.  After a short period of time (15 minutes) a bright object was observed traveling in a south east direction.  The object appeared to be twice as large as Venus, moving very fast (twice as fast an airplane) and dimmed in brightness as it’s distance from us increased.  We assumed it was the ISS with the docked shuttle Endeavor.    This initial sighting was approximately 30 minutes after sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From that point onward we observed multiple lights exhibiting various levels of brightness and speed.  Our observations lasted until approximately 10:30pm CST.  We assumed that the lights we saw were satellites in orbit.  If this is the correct explanation what explains the variable brightness, speed, and the large number of objects?  The path of the objects appeared random.  Some traveled directly north, while others traveled east, south, west, and varying combinations.  More than one object exhibited brightness variations even though the sun had set one hour before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were star like and fast.  In one case a commercial airliner was flying due west and was overtaken (as viewed from our perspective) by one of the star like objects flying in the same direction.  Our interpretation was that the smaller object was at a substantially higher altitude ... possibly low earth orbit.  At one point we saw four objects moving in separate directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS sighting.  Satellites are different sizes, and have different albedos.  PD))<n>

I stood up to watch, while she ran thru the house, out front to the car, and had time to get the carmera and take a few pictures. It made no noise and wasn&#39;t close to us or the ground. Finally it passed the southern roof line and turned southeast, instantly loosing its bright star appearance. Next I saw a red dot as it disppeared into the black sky. It had no exhaust trails. I checked the time and it was 9:11 p.m. My wife had goosebumps and was very excited. I estimate it took about 3 minutes to travel 30&#39; feet of the roofline, so it must have been at least few miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS sighting.  PD))<n>

Suddenly I saw a silver, roud circle going from right to left. It went quite slow, and it was not too far away. and first I thought it was a bird. But when I looked better I saw it didn&#39;t have wings. It was just a roud ball. I thought myself it was impossible for a round ball to fly. I was nailed to the ground and I kept looking to the object until it disappeared behind the monastir tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It didn&#39;t make any noise, and it didn&#39;t left any traces.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realised that it could be nothing else than an UFO, also because I have seen many videos with the same object as the one I saw.<n>

My older brother told us to look at how bright that star was.  We all looked up in time to hear him say it was moving.  We all watched it as it move south east across the sky, then came to a stop over us, but it seemed very high in the sky. When it stopped the light got really dim, then got very bright, brighter then before.  Then the light took off very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat there and watched the sky then about 5 minuets later it appeared coming from the south this time moving slower and the light going form bright to dim.  Once again it stopped over us, but was very high in the sky, once again the light got very bright, but it so far away it just looked like an extra bright star.  It sat there bright for about 5-10 minutes then just disappeared, like it turned the light off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We both had our eyes caught by an object in the sky.  It was between the shape of a twisted envelope and a cigar and caught our attention because it was sparkling like diamonds, or a silver holograph,  then it just disappeared, and we both looked at each other and said “What the h*** was that?”  It was too high in the sky to go below the horizon, and the sun was too high in the sky and at the wrong angle for it to be the sun reflecting off of it.  The object was moving east toward the coast.  Maybe lasted 5-10 seconds.  We were joking afterwards that some one had just gotten in trouble for  hitting the uncloaking button,  because it appeared and then disappeared so quickly.  We are aged 24 and 49.  We’ve watched aircraft take off and land, space launches,  meteor showers,  and other phenomena but never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

7/24/09 23:30|Kingston|GA|Light|10-15s|A star-like object that moved rapidly and erratically in a clear sky, then sudden disappeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Not ISS.  PD))|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71427.html|118|ndxe200907| A star-like object that moved rapidly and erratically in a clear sky, then sudden disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday night, 7/24/09, I was staying alone at my country place near Kingston in NW GA, about 15 miles from the nearest metropolitan areas (Cartersville, Rome).  It was a clear moonless night, so I hoped for some good night sky viewing (even though I’m no astronomer).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly before midnight I went out to look at the sky, and easily spotted the Big Dipper in the NW sky, and Polaris.  I happened to be looking towards an open space between some trees to the NE, at about 45 degrees above the horizon, and could see a number of stars though I couldn’t name the constellation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Movement caught my eye, and I noticed a light that looked like a star (no apparent size, shape or color) which seemed to be moving with respect to the fixed stars in a 10 o’clock direction.  At first I assumed it was a distant airplane, although its angular speed seemed large for the apparent distance, given that I heard no sound.  What first startled me was that after a few seconds it suddenly changed direction by more than 90 degrees with no apparent curve to its trajectory.  A few seconds later it started moving erratically (like Brownian motion) at high rates of angular velocity; then it almost stopped at a point about which it jittered rapidly (like a laser pointer that someone is trying to hold still).  A couple of seconds after that the light suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up to that time it had been in clear sky (not close to the tree cover), and the nearby stars remained clearly visible just as before it disappeared.  The whole event lasted no more than 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards I felt rather stunned, asking myself if I had really seen what I thought I saw...I couldn’t begin to explain it to myself.  The object’s rapid angular movement, changes of direction and sudden disappearance made no physical sense.   I waited, watching in the same direction, for perhaps 5 minutes but saw nothing more of an unusual nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 60 years old, with a BS in Physics and have worked in engineering most of my career.  I’m not a religious person or a follower of any sort of cult or even interest group.  I simply perceived an event in the sky like nothing I had ever seen before, which appeared to have no rational explanation.<n>
7/24/09 23:30|Boston|MA|Diamond|5-10 minutes|Giant white glowing Star like object (diamond shaped) above Boston MA|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71306.html|119|ndxe200907| Giant white glowing Star like object (diamond shaped) above Boston MA<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends and I were driving to a club in Boston.  We got lost and I looked up into the sky and noticed a giant bright white star.  To my eyes, it appeared diamond shaped. I watched it as we drove towards it and noticed it did not change directions or even move.  It stayed perfectly still. My friend thought it was a star until we noticed clouds moving behind it.  We had no idea what it could of been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we turned around to try and find our way through the city on search of the club we were going to. We moved away from the giant star like object.  I could no longer keep it in my eye of view. But for 5 whole minutes during that time of driving towards it, I watched it from the car window.  Did not take my eye off of it.  I wanted to make sure it wasn&#39;t a plane or something more explainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ended up getting lost again until we were right back where the giant white reflective star was and I saw it again.  This time it had moved towards the west side and again was sitting perfectly in the sky that had no stars in it.  Since Boston is very bright, you normally don&#39;t see stars. We ignored the object and drove away to find our destination.  At 2:30am after we got out of the club, I looked for it again on our drive home and did not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description:  This object seemed large, diamond or circular shaped.  It was silent.  Stayed perfectly still. All electronic devices in our car were working (cellphone and other gadgets)  If it did move, it moved very slowly then paused.  Moved up and down behind the clouds then back out again to where you could noticed the clouds behind it.  Very bright and color was off white.  It was Glowing. No other star or aircraft was in the area.  Just clouds and dark sky.<n>

Suddenly a bluish white orb appeared out of the darkness.  The orb was approximately 5 times larger than any of the stars in the sky, and about the same color.  It moved very quickly and smoothly. I could not hear any jets or engines.  The craft was completely silent. As it cruised across the middle of the sky, I notice that above and to the object&#39;s left was another orb.  This one was a faint reddish color, and it followed the same path, running parallel to the whitish orb.  After about 30seconds both orbs vanished into thin air.  I was quite excited to see these objects, if not slightly disappointed that I had no one there corroborate the events.<n>

They were flying right next to each other over top of us.  A few seconds later, the dimmer light just disappeared.   The bright light continued to fly at a consistent pace.  There were no flashing lights, like on a plane and the light was very big and bright. Then one of us made a comment “What if the light just disappeared?

This went on spradic movements for 25 minutes, a red light was on outside of parameter of the blue lights, the red light was smaller than blue lights. The blue lights then dissapeared then a very large blue light, size of moon was still for around 20 minutes, smaller ones dissapeared. It was like the blue ones had amalgamated into one large blue one. All of a sudden the large blue one moved speedily from one position to another, then speedily dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These UFO’s were most unusual!

I never saw anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 11pm, and warm outside.  I was taking my dog out to do her business and also taking the trash out. As I was walking down my apartment stairs I noticed 3 bright lights in the ski.  One was standing still, one was moving to the left, and the other was coming straight for me or more like over my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I didn’t think anything of it because I live by Boeing airfield in Everett. Then I noticed that the one that was coming towards me was really bright, kind of like the north star that those guys where following to find Jesus, but this was no star I promise you that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed it had no other lights like a regular aircraft. No red, green, or blue lights that usually flash on a plane or helicopter, the other two where the same. I was more focused on the one coming closer to me, because I could see it so clearly. I also noticed it was flying lower than a plane. Planes from Boeing don’t take off over my apartment ever, and they never get that close to our apartment like that. There was also no sound. You would defiantly hear noise if it was that close. Now when I say close, I don’t mean hit my house close but it was to close for a normal plane, and if it was a helicopter I would have heard it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then also as it got closer I noticed it was swinging side to side, kind of like how if you hold up a necklace and it swings side to side. By now I was getting a little excited because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Then I quickly looked at the one moving to the left and it was moving at the same speed, and it looked the same. It was just farther away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third one was higher and standing still, but I am not sure if it was the space station or not. I don’t know exactly where it is in the ski, but I never noticed it there before until last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I decided to run in my house, and go on the deck to watch the one that was coming towards me pass over my house, but as I got there, nothing came over. It was just gone. If it was a real plane it should have come right over my apartment, and past right in front of my deck. But it didn’t. Then I ran back out to see if I could see the other one and it was gone. The only one left was the one that was standing still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am going to go back out tonight to see if I can see the one that was standing still, and if I can then it was just the space station. The other two where nothing like what I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still in shock.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Letting the dog out for the night, he ran to the front of the property and began to bark, whimper and scurried into the house.  Very little stars out but did notice in the near distance, a large glowing orange ball.   Walking backwards toward the house, I looked away to grab the handle of the door and when I looked back the object was gone.  The object did not get lost in the trees or behind buildings, the property is in the country and there is an open expanse of sky. It was just gone.<n>

It was a very bright red and extremely fast flying object. Like nothing we had ever seen before. It was surely no army aircraft, at first it seemed as it was just a bright red star, but then it suddenly started moving with a very high speed. It was also fascinating to see that all those UFO’s were moving towards the same direction. They were moving towards Jupiter which was over the sea so it was east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the first one had gone we didn’t see much for a while until a couple just flew in to view like from nowhere again heading eastwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I decided to bring out the small telescope we had in our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite the objects very high speed, I pointed the telescope towards east in hope that another one might pass in to view. Three passed again in the same direction, but I was not able to capture them in time. I saw another one coming from a distance again just one bright light going into a straight line towards east. I was able to aim the telescope a bit ahead of its course then I managed to capture it just for a split second. One thing was clear to me that it wasn’t a plane. It was just an extremely bright light moving in a straight line with out making a noise and moving in a speed I have never seen before and disappearing right in front of our eyes. Even with the telescope I wasn’t able to identify the shape of the object as it moved very quickly and eventually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that we saw even more of them all moving to the same palace, but not in a squadron formation like army planes would do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The four of us look at that same sky every night and never in the 3 years we have owned this house have we seen something like that. We have no idea what it might be, but some how we fell it has something to do with the object that hit Jupiter last Sunday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do hope you will have the time to look in to this report as I think it might be important.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Another object was seen about eight degrees behind the station, following in its orbit.  And, an unusual light was seen in the northwest about two minutes before the Station passed over, which has left us puzzled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Things were not looking good for astronomy Friday night.  Though the weather forecast was for clear skies, clouds had been passing through.  We planned to try and get a telescope on the Space Station, to see if we could make out any details.  The pass of the Station was scheduled to start at 1013pm ET, and to last for about two minutes.  The important fact was that it would be around 50 degrees high, which would be high enough to see from our observatory, but low enough to make pointing easy - for pointing a telescope right overhead is a chore!<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 1005pm, clearing was seen to be moving in from the southwest.  We opened up the observatory and turned the dome west.  The Station was scheduled to appear just to the right of west, and to move left toward the south before disappearing.  As we were turning the tube on our 10&#34; Newtonian to bring the eyepiece to the proper angle, we noticed a light high overhead, heading northwest.  The light was orange and quite bright, perhaps magnitude 0 or brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the light head down into the northwest, and by slow speed and appearance it was assumed to be a satellite. It was viewed with 15x70 binoculars and appeared only as a bright orange light.   The light stayed the same brightness as it went along, and we were wondering what satellite might be so bright.   Just then, at an altitude of about 25 degrees, it made a sharp turn left to a heading of roughly south.  At that point, we were a little more puzzled. But, the object disappeared behind our maple tree which sits due west of the observatory.  Maybe it was a helicopter, but we heard no noise and the light appeared exactly the same down low as when high overhead, which does not suggest a directional light like a landing light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By then, it was just about time for the Station to appear.  On schedule, it appeared above the maple tree, and we got the telescope on it.  By positioning the telescope ahead of the Station with a reticle finder, we were able to pick up the Station and move the scope by hand at a power of about 30x. We&#39;d move the scope, look for a second as the Station passed through, and jerk the scope ahead a bit.  We lost the Station after about fifteen seconds, and when we went back to the reticle finder to reposition it, we looked up and saw the other object trailing the Station.   We now think it is either a new module which was launched toward the station today, or a resupply vessel which was cut loose from the station a few weeks back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, the excitement of the night will make this a night to remember.  Actually, the light we saw before the Station pass was most memorable. It floated along silently like a satellite, and it remained the same brightness and color the whole time we saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, when viewing the Station through a telescope, it looks bigger than expected.  It is very bright yellow, almost fiery looking, and the major components can be seen. It is hard to make out very much when manually pushing the telescope to stay on the target, however.<n>

Clear, dry weather conditions, little or no wind.  Humidity level was very low, as a weather system cleaned out the humidity several hours earlier.  Stars were visable in every direction.  I saw  what would have looked like an extremely bright star move across the sky from SW to NE.  It was approximately 10X brighter than the brightest star, and moved in a straight line.  I witnessed this for about 20 seconds.  It was much slower than any meteorite and moved about the speed of a jet.  There were no blinking lights, and after 20 seconds, it dimmed, then dissapeared.  When it disappeared, there were no clouds in the sky, and I could see stars in every direction around where it vanished.  It was extremely bright before this happened, and there was no noise whatsoever.  It was whitish to a faint blue in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

On this night, 7/24/09 at 22:15 I saw what appeared to be a satellite traveling north to south however, this object&#39;s brightness intensified to a point it was clearly the brighest object in the sky and maintained that level for approximatetly 10 seconds.  As both of us looked on in amazement it quickly dimmed orange in color than disappeared from our sight. At no time did we hear any noise<n>

At the far end of the track, I turned to look up at the stars facing slightly southwest.  I noticed a very bright &#34;star&#34; and figured it was a planet.  It looked like Venus.   Then I noticed that it was moving slowly.  My oldest (19) also started to watch it.  It was a steady light – I kept waiting for it to blink (like an airplane). (Of course, the youngest started watching too.  We didn’t discuss &#34;what&#34; we were seeing until everything was over.)  Anyhow, back to the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was moving and I kept following it.  Then a smaller &#34;light&#34; started moving in the same path.  The smaller light started to &#34;gain&#34; on the larger light.  (Neither one blinked like a plane.)  Just when the smaller one looked like it was going to overtake the big one, it just disappeared.  I continued to watch the larger light (and looking for the s! maller one to re-emerge).  Then the bigger light did the same thing, just disappeared.  While this was going on, a large commercial aircraft was flying south (it was blinking lights like a normal plane).  I also did see a meteorite (shooting star), but it had an arc to it and did not look the same as the &#34;lights.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of ISS.  PD))<n>

I was looking at the stars, identifying constellations, when I turned to look at the sky in the southeast, over the top of a building I saw a flying object enter my field of vision. The UFO flew completely, eerily silent, at a low altitude probably around a few hundred feet, and at an unusually slow and constant pace. The object was dark with three large bright white lights in a triangular configuration on its underside, one toward the front, two in the back. It was somewhat difficult to make out the exact shape due to its angle, and the prominence of it’s lights although it appeared to be flat and triangular, with each white light close to each tip. The size appeared to be around that of a large helicopter. There was one faint, small flashing light towards the front on the side of the object which seemed to emit multiple colors of w! hich I remember green, white/yellow, and blue. The object flew over us westward toward the university campus and was visible for around one and a half, possibly two minutes. My friend who was about 30 feet in front of me and who witnessed it for around 30 seconds saw the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/24/09 21:45|Ypsilanti|MI|Unknown|5 minutes|a bright orange (flame like) light ascending toward the north-north east in the vicinity of Willow Run airport in Ypsilanti, MI|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71277.html|136|ndxe200907| a bright orange (flame like) light ascending toward the north-north east in the vicinity of Willow Run airport in Ypsilanti, MI<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking near dusk to the east over the neighbor&#39;s houses and saw what at first I thought was something like a helium balloon someone had let go with something burning hanging from it.  A really bright orange light flickering like a flame.  Still assuming it was just a balloon I moved as it went behind some trees to catch sight of it coming around the other side but realized the clouds weren&#39;t noticeably moving and there was no noticeable wind at ground level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued to move north north east and the light never changed in intensity.  We are close to Willow Run airport, and the light seemed to be heading NNE toward the direction of the aiport - but flight paths in that area of the sky are generally heading &#39;away&#39; from the airport unless they are on landing approach (descending rather than ascending).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to see if I could spot any strobes or navigation (red/green) lighting but the orange flicker was too intense.  I also strained to hear any sort of engine noises but heard none and it was generally quiet due to the time of the evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the light continue to ascend in a rather consistent north-north east direction, getting slightly smaller but still quite intense and still flickering orange like a flame until it eventually disapeered into the clouds to the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was more than likely just a plane with a whacked out light, but they generally don&#39;t take a flight path that would be that close to the airport and I could not hear any sounds of engine noises which is generally strange for anything that bright. (generally meaning it is closer proximity)  Also it would have been at least somewhat in profile when I first saw it and was obviously headed away when I finally lost sight of it - generally when you catch site of a plane coming or going from the airport, you may for example see a landing light that appears quite intense, but that is only when the plane is coming directly at you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I contacted the local police department non-emergency line and my call was the first they had heard of it.  I also attempted to contact Willow Run airport but due to the time of night I only got voice mail.  Worried that it might have been a plane on fire, I also called the airport emergency dispatch from the number listed on Willow Run&#39;s voice mail message, but similarly my call was the first they had heard of it and they had no reports of aircraft emergencies.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A large, lit cigar-shaped object was noticed by me moving at a slow velocity in a westward-slight northwest ward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, when first noticed at 21:31 PM was in a general position of 45 degrees above the southernmost horizon of Albuquerque and moved to a stationary position approximately 15 degrees above the western most horizon above Albuquerque’s Nine Mile Hill by 21:34 PM. At 21:33 PM, I placed a call to Albuquerque 9-1-1 to inquire if anybody else had reported this event also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the intersection of Central and Carlisle NE, the object’s light dimmed slowly for approximately two seconds, then intensified greatly. While eyeing the object, we drove 1/4 mile southwest to a higher vantage point in the city at Lead and Amherst NE. My girlfriend and I parked and exited the vehicle to concentrate on the unfolding events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What appeared originally as a singular, intensifying object was “growing” into a crescent-shaped object with now two other, distinctive intensifying lights; equaling now three, bright lights. At 21:36 PM, I placed a call to my boss who lives in far NE Heights section of Albuquerque with a view towards the west for his opinion on the events. He witnessed the object immediately with his naked eye and later with great detail via a telescope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a structure hundreds of stories tall. As it was positioned stationary, the bottom light (which was what appeared to be the original cigar object)was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon in the sky. The top of the structure(what was the third light) was at the 25 degree mark above the horizon. The second light was at the 20 degree position between the two lights. Again, all three light were arced in a crescent shape, with the 25 degree light being the northernmost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lit object/s was/were visible from my vantage point until 21:51 PM. From 21:36 PM to 21:51 PM. From 21:35 PM to 21:38 PM , smaller, ancillary objects/lights appeared to rotate and fly around the stationary three, main objects/lights. From 21:39 to 21:41 PM, a large, unlit structure (close in appearance to an Eiffel Tower like-shaped structure) appeared from the extreme top of third light located at the 25 degree mark above horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 21:49 PM, I placed  a call to my parents home in Seattle, Washington to describe to them what was happening. At 21:50 PM, 25 degrees above the horizon light dimmed, but was still visible. At 21:50:30 PM, 20 degrees above the horizon light dimmed, but was still visible. At 21:51 PM, 15 degrees above the horizon light (and the original lit object)dimmed completely; object and lights completely ceased from view on the horizon.<n>

It had been raining with T-storms.The rain stopped but it was still cloudy. At 8:15 PM (E.S.T.) I was looking South/South-East across Market Street and the D&amp;H Railroad when a bolt of lightning came down with two branches of lightning coming down from the main bolt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of these two &#34;tributary&#34; bolts popped out two metallic orange/copper colored disks that tumbled out for at least one full second then suddenly disappeared. I would say that at arms length these objects were 1/2 the size of my thumb nails.I&#39;m guessing they were at least a mile away.I don&#39;t recall any sound from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear to God these things were NOT &#34;ball lightning&#34;. These crafts both had domes on them and were all the same color as stated above. About one minute after this, a YELLOW bolt of lightning (to the left of what I had just seen) bolted UP. If anyone has ever seen what I&#39;ve just described anywhere I&#39;d sure like to hear about it. These things were obviously manufactured by some kind of intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At that point, it was just a light moving in a straight path in the sky.  We live an hour North of Dallas and very close to a local small airport and see aircraft frequently.  The aircraft I was following was traveling from the NW to the SE when I noticed a bright flash (like a camera flash) off to the left of the object I was tracking.  Then off to the right of the object about a minute later, another flash, but no object observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to visually track the object I thought was an aircraft, it suddenly made a sharp left turn in an arc like an aircraft might do, but it seemed to turn upward and rapidly disappeared out of sight.  Mush faster than an aircraft might do based on the distance I thought it was from my observation point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day my wife and I observed some discolored grass in our yard not noticed before.  We noticed a pattern of 5 spots in a pentagon shape about 2 ft in circumference spaced equally apart and one spot off to the side.  I tried to think of something I might have had on the lawn that weekend and cannot recall placing anything on the lawn that would discolor the grass like that.<n>

Just wanted to submit the photo in case anyone else ever see&#39;s or has seen something similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The photograph clearly shows a few raindrops as it had just started to slightly rain (which I must say didnt last for long, the rest of the day was sunny but there were big rain clouds around) so you can easily compare the raindrop to the disk shape in the picture.  The conclusion of the photo analysis in my opinion left me with unanswered questions.<n>

One was leading and the other was always trying to catch up!,,the leader was also waiting for the other now &amp; then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both passed me about half a mile away at still roughly 100 feet high, thats when i seen two more!and it got a lot more interesting!!.They followed more or less the same flight pattern , i couldnt work out what they were and i was puzzled because they were silent i thought they may be hot air balloons but it was a crystal clear night with tons of stars out and perfectly calm,not even a whisper of wind!.Then to my surprise the leader of this second pair deviated and travelled straight toward me,as god is my witness ive never seen anything like this in my life on tv or in the flesh!,,it was amazing!!!, it stayed at roughly the same height and stopped moving and just hovered in front of me but it was really close!,id say about 60 feet away horizontally. I witnessed in crisp detail what this thing looked like even at night!,ive got a good sense of perspective and id say it was sixty to eighty feet in circumference completely round and covered in what looked like huge bunsen ! burners and individually these were changing fast from low to high flame,i realised this was what all the flickering was at a distance!. I could see the object behind the flames was dark in colour maybe grey or black, i was amazed to see these jets so big and very close yet completely silent!!.Then after hovering there for about 40 seconds it began to make its way back to the other one and they both travelled the same path as the first two till they all came together roughly two to three miles from where i was standing.Thats when another puzzling thing happened, one of them moved away a bit from the rest then stopped and in about five seconds just faded out, then one by one each of the remaining went to the same spot as the first and disappeared the same.Id consider myself an excellent witness &amp; will never forget that night!,hope someone out there witnessed as much as i did as it would be great to get the sighting verified as a genuine ufo sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I t was a clear night with no clouds, the stars were out and you could see planes flying with their lights on. I noticed this orange ball in the sky, it was 95% orange (bright) and 5% white (litlle glimpses of white light) at first we just thought it was a plane or helicopter, but seen as we had already seen a plane and a helicopter nearby, this object was totally different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very quick and lasted in our location for about 15 second before moving off at a quick speed. The object did not stay still or hover at any time, but it moved constantly. What attracted our attention to it was it immense bright orange light with looked amazing in the black night sky. Secondly, it moved very very fast. It did not dissapear in a zap or a second, but it moved accross our path at a tremendouse speed, atleast 10 to 20 times faster then any aeroplane was moving in the sky. it was moving so fast that it came accross our location, moved straight over head, and kept going untill we both lost its visibilty - all in the space of 15-16 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object moved in the distance, we both said what on earth was that, did u see how fast it moved?!  There could be a logical explanation for this, but having spoken to a few people with aircraft experience about this, none seem to know what type of plane/helicopter craft could move this fast, and that emits a bright orange light and is a ball//circle shape.<n>

No strobe or other blinking lights that would indicate an aircraft (at least not a conventional one) . The intensity and color of the light was that of a star. The altitude was over 10000 feet. It was moving in my direction at  an angle of about 30 degrees from where I was and by the time I realized it was something unusual the object abruptly stopped (,way before reaching a patch of clouds) for a fraction of a second then I could clearly saw it dimming, first half way the brightenes then completely  vanished like shouting straight up in to the outer space. This disapering act was at the most 2 seconds maybe more like one. The direction it was coming from coincides with almost a straight line to Groom lake ( Area 51).  I am 100% it was not an airplane , meteor or an optical illusion. I watch the sky often and I am  very familiar with the ! above .   This is however  the first time I have wittenes such an event my self .  Wonder if any one else can relate to last nights event or others similar<n>

On the ride down I stopped first in a place called “Area 101” where I spoke with a number of UFO enthusiasts about the contact movement’s program of interacting with the intelligence (presumably ET) behind the UFO phenomenon. From there I headed south and met with a young man who described his having positive interactions with what he identified as ETs throughout his life with numerous sightings that he claimed had an interactive component. After I explained to him a term that I have coined called “prime contactee (reserved for individuals who can request a sighting and actually have one occur)  he thought that he definitely was a “prime.”   At my Mom’s house in Koreatown I brought my luggage up to the second floor and looked out through a screen window. It was 1:45 AM. The lights of the city reflecting off the overcast skies lit up the neighborhood. The silhouettes of palm trees graced the horizon. I gazed out to the west and immediately noticed a blinking stationary red light about ten degrees above the rooftops of the surrounding two story homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For many years I have looked through that window on visits to LA and can never recall seeing such a light in the sky before. It was difficult to judge its distance as there were no landmarks behind it. It was relatively large, about a finger breaths wide at arms full length. In trying to figure our what it was my first thought was of  flashing red lights on a radio antennae array some 3 miles to the west.  They are not visible from my Mom’s house and besides this light was solitary and far too large. As I had this thought the light began to slowly move horizontally to the north. This was no stationary aircraft beacon sitting on an antenna. Police helicopters routinely patrol this part of central LA and the light was not part of any fixed or rotating wing aircraft. At this late hours all was quiet in  this heavily residential neighborhood. The red pulsating object, circular in shape moved behind a tree. I waited for it to emerge into view on the other side. It did not. I wait! ed and scanned the sky and listened intently for the sound of aircraft. None  could be was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was this just another &#34;random sighting?&#34; Or could it have been a consciousness mediated show of support for my networking efforts among the UFO experiencers that I like to call &#34;the contact underground?&#34; My guess is that it was a show of support because the next day I got a call from a contact team leader who told me that her skywatch team had a sighting of a round red UFO at midnight the previous night. It was less than two hours before my sighting. Coincidence? Perhaps but I don&#39;t think so!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The source of this report is a competent investigator in the field of ufology, and we suspect that this is a quite accurate report.

When the lighting hit, it lit the clouds up with a nice purple color.  Very beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to the West in crystal clear sky.  Overhead, my wife and I saw a very bright light.  It looked exactly like a star, only much larger and brighter.  It was flying in a straight path, and was silent.  No engine noise was heard at all.  The brightness was very intense.  The light did not blink or flicker, but stayed constantly light.  The object also seemed to be flying at a very slow rate of speed, and did not change altitude.  It flew directly overhead, but no object could be made out, just light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I turned around back towards our home so we could keep watching the object.  We followed it as we walked past three houses.  At the third house, our view was blocked by a few trees.  Based on the speed it was flying, we should have been easily able to see the object once we were past the trees.  However, the object was simply gone without a trace.  Whether the light simply turned off, or it shot off in the distance, we will never know.  The experience was incredible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night, there were other aircraft in the sky besides the object.  We saw a propeller airplane far off to the East, and could hear its engine noise in the distance.  This object had no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I have been living in Portage county for over twenty years, and have never seen anything like this.

This object seemed to hit the glowing light and at once the light started dimming. It then rapidly moved to the right in a slightly zig-zag pattern, flew upwards, at this point almost dark, and dissapered. About 30 seconds later we could hear many many sirens in the distance.<n>

We had just finished a late supper and were getting ready to settle down by the fire and relax before turning in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son said &#34;What is that?&#34;  We turned to look and there was an orange glowing object going from east to west and then turned north.  It stopped or seemed to and then did like a zig zag and then stopped again until it dissapeared.   We were all speechless!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood on the bank by the lake and watched even after it disappeared.  It lasted at least 7 min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I asked some of our fellow campers if they had seen anything,  One told us they seen something the night before but it was traveling in the opposite direction from what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then campers down farther said they had seen it too.  It happened just after sunset and they were down on the beach watching the sunset when they seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object glowed as though it was on! fire, it was orange and red.  I thought it was a meteor but last time I checked they went in a straight path through the sky and this deffinitely changed directions at least three if not four times!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen some strange things but this was by far one of the most memorable and unexplained!<n>

I walked out to put the dog out to do business when I glanced up and noticed a star like object.  I thought it was moving but seeing how the mind can play tricks and stars appear to move sometimes  I was really shocked that it really was moving very slowly. It was bright white.   I ran inside the house, and grabbed my cell phone to try to document if it did anything else.  I got back outside and it had moved over my property and then just blinked out.  There was no clouds in the sky at the time.  The object was flying very low. Probably at helicopter or cesna level.    Going from West to east but then curving towards the south.  It couldn&#39;t have been very big,  maybe the size of a car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 12:15 in the morning on Thursday July 23rd, I  saw two crafts following right after another, but these were reddish orange blinking and moving quickly. They also seemed to be flying at a higher altitude then the previous object.  They came from the same direction as the star like craft travelling west to east over highway 72 near Lake Springs, Missouri.  My daughter saw these two objects with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also no sounds were auidble.<n>

I  live on top of a mountain at about  8,000 feet. I  looked up at the sky and saw a very large bright light moving at high speed from the east to the west.  There was no sound and no flashing lights.  It was not a plane.  I at first thought that it might be the space station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, I did some research on  the internet and the space station was not over Avon on that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were also not any known satellites in the area.  It was also moving much too fast for the space station according to a friend who has watched it several times.  It was not a meteor and did not leave a trail. It moved horizontally and was extremely bright.  There have been many UFO sightings in our area recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt that it was important to add this one to your database.    I am also hoping that someone else saw this one.<n>
7/22/09 21:00|Alliance|NE|Light|30 minutes|Saw 7 ufo's in the night sky;  all within a 30 min.; most of which were going different dir.'s.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites?  PD))|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71249.html|172|ndxe200907| Saw 7 ufo&#39;s in the night sky of alliance, all within a 30 minute time-period, most of which were going different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside on the phone with my father, when all of a sudden in the northeastern part of the sky, I noticed a white light in the sky, it was moving faster than a satellite, and slightly brighter than one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started shouting at my dad over the phone that I was looking directly right at one, as I have been seeing these for a couple months now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly out of the corner of my eye, I saw another one, moving in the same direction, but from a different point of the sky. It was at this time I got real excited, and started to scan the sky with my eyes to see if there were more. So I went out to the street and looked behind the house, and saw another one moving in the opposite direction of where the other 2 were heading (away from me). Within minutes, another one came from the direction that the 3rd was moving, but heading in the complete opposite direction (toward me). It was at this point that I got off the phone with my father to go get my wife so she could witness this phenomenon. As soon as we came back out, she spotted one moving right over our heads (the 5th one), at that point she was pretty nervous. Then as luck would have it, we see another (the 6th) coming from a completely new direction, lost sight of it as it was moving even faster than the others and quickly faded behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right before going inside, we spotted one last one (a 7th). It too was moving fairly quickly, and within a matter of a couple minutes it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point our necks hurt and we went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All-in-all, a very exciting night for the city of alliance, NE. I see sightings here all the time, it&#39;s a real hot-spot for ufo activity, and furthermore I will start reporting more often now that my dad introduced me to this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I Encourage any ufologists out there to come stay in alliance and go sky-searching at night, from 9am, to 5am for some really exciting sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the objects may have been satellites.

7/22/09 02:40|Hamburg|MI|Other|2 minutes|Single Electric Blue gumdrop shaped object appeared with a flash and appeared to land.|7/28/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76727.html|173|ndxe200907| Single Electric Blue gumdrop shaped object appeared with a flash and appeared to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is to document a sighting of an unidentifiable object in the sky that was witnessed by myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a part time job delivering the AnnArbor.com newspaper on Thursday and Sunday Mornings.  I typically start delivering my papers at around 2:00 am.  I have ~150 customers and I have a very set routine of delivering my route.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the Morning of July 22, 2010, at exactly 2:40am (I just remembered that I called my wife when this event happened and I verified the time when I called her).  I called my wife at 2:42 am and told her about what I saw and that I was coming home because I was too freaked out to continue delivering my papers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a street called Louis Lane in Hamburg, MI.  It is a residential street in a generally rural area and the street is probably ½ to ¾ mile long and is in the shape of a horseshoe.  The street is along the north side of the main road (Strawberry Lake Road).  Imagine breaking the horseshoe shaped street into two parts, the eastern half of the street and the western half of the street.  I always begin delivering papers on this street on the eastern portion of the horseshoe and am facing north when I pull into this street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into a customer’s driveway, threw the paper up by the garage, and reversed out of the driveway to continue on my way.  When I began to proceed, I saw a flash of blueish light (like lightning) along the northern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out my windshield to see if a storm was maybe on its way, but it was one of the clearest nights this summer.  However, at that moment a second flash was closer and brighter and my NPR radio station cut to static for may! be 5 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was really creepy, but I continued on my way.  At this point I was rounding the top of the Horseshoe and was facing west, I looked out my driver side window which was facing to the south and that is when I saw what really made me think about it being a &#34;U.F.O.&#34;   The object that I witnessed was about 20 degrees off of the southern horizon, just above a line of trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was less than 100’ in the air, it was glowing electric blue in color, it was approximately the size of a quarter and was definitely close, I’d say within a ¼ mile distance.  The object moved westward while it descended behind the trees and appeared to land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the object disappear behind the trees, I continued to drive slowly and was now facing south and was now on the western portion of Louis Lane.  I put my car in park and turned off my lights and continued to look south towards where I saw the object disappear.  I stayed for maybe a minute and witnessed some intermittent blue colored flashing coming from the direction of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my wife at exactly 2:42 am and told her what I just saw.  I told her that I didn’t want to finish my route at night and was going to wait until day to finish.  I was pretty scared, so I got out of the neighborhood, and drove east at 75 mph down Strawberry Lake Road, until I got into town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped at the Hamburg Township Police department and seriously considered walking in to report what I saw, but I didn’t.  In Hamburg, MI, there is a 24-hour ((deleted)) gas station that I always stop at before I start my route.  I always ((speak)) with the guy who works midnights, his name is ((name deleted)).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my way back home, I stopped to tell ((name deleted)) what I saw.  ((name deleted)) was in some disbelief, but he said that it was kind of strange because there was a very brief loss of electricity at the gas station at around the same time that I told him what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) said that it could be the Police helicopters, because they look for people growing marijuana at night.  I expressed that I didn’t think it was a helicopter, because the whole thing was glowing electric blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then drove the 10 miles back to my house, eventually went to sleep and finished delivering my papers when it was light outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a ((deleted)) student and attend ((deleted)) school in Ann Arbor, MI.  I told a few students what had happened earlier that morning, and two of my classmates, said that they were up late and also experienced the brief power outage at around the same time.  However, these guys live in the city of Ann Arbor, and I was nearly 15 miles north of the City of Ann Arbor when this happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event that I witnessed was very brief and I left before I could see anything else happen.  Just thinking about this event still makes my skin crawl.  I used to prefer delivering my papers when its dark, but I seriously don’t think I’m ever going to start my route until the sun comes up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be sober-minded and credible.  We also received a telephone call from a woman in Harper Woods (Detroit) about what sounds to be the same event, but we have not received a follow-up written report from her.  PD))<n>

My father was driving, we were just driving through Victorville, Ca on Palmdale Rd. As I looked into the sky, I thought about a cousin who once shared with me her UFO sighting experience. So I thought I might just get to see one. I had seen a few shooting stars but remembered how my cousin told me about what the light looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at the big dipper and looked at the North star and all the other bright stars. I looked again observing The Big Dipper and suddenly I saw what appeared to be a circle. It was orange with some red. The light was solid, not blinking, no color change. I had never seen a star like that…..at the same time I saw an airplane and its light blink red and blue. I tried reaching for my camera but not taking my eye off the object. I knew then that there are no orange stars, not normal. I asked my dad for the time, 10:35 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange circle then began to move slowly side to side but in a circular motion. It visually wasn’t to far from a star. It then began to move fast past the star. The circle seemed to be as far as a star but I knew it was in our atmosphere. It then began to move higher into the sky and it quickly hit a right and suddenly stopped. Right before my eyes the light just got super small and disappeared as if it bolted at lightning speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is Friday, July 24, 2009 and I cant believe that I had that experience. I don’t know what to think of it. I know what I saw is real. I always believed in martians. I feel weird. I now want to go out late night and observe the sky. I am not afraid, but it makes me question a lot, religiously. And how can they be so advanced? Well I would like to see more. My dad believes me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It is a common thing I like to do, I noticed a small light above the Cascade mountians coming towards my home town.  It was fire orange moving at a pretty good speed.  I know it was no satellite because it wasn&#39;t very high in the sky.  As it got closer It began to slow down.  I was so exited to see something way out of the ordinery.  As it got to be a mile and a half away I could see it much better.  Its flight pattern was not exactly a straight line,but more zig-zag or wavey.  It was perfectly round and very bright fire orange. as it drew near my town it began to dimmer into a smaller size light and zipped away in a very fast manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that I turn to walk back to my house and noticed something else that was going on.  Unusual northern lights to the north,the sun went down a few hours ago and there is no moon this time of month.  I got my wife out of bed to tell and show her what just happened she said that it looks like the sun is going rise from the east like a morning effect,but it looked like moon light....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

7/21/09 22:25|Munising|MI|Light|2 minutes|Orange orb viewed moving East South East in a "floating" pattern before disappearing.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71231.html|180|ndxe200907| Orange orb viewed moving East South East in a &#34;floating&#34; pattern before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A small reddish orange (almost fiery) orb was noticed in the East South East sky at 10:25 p.m. on July 21, 2009..  The orb was mostly overhead when first noticed but continued in the direction it was first seen (East South East).   It continued moving in a &#34;floating&#34; side to side pattern as it seemed to slowly lose its vibrant light and disappear after heading in the direction for about two minutes.  It was small in the sky but still dwarfed many of the stars and could be 10-20 combined in the sky.  It gave off a good amount of light until the end when it slowly faded out.  The sky was a clear night with little clouds, and none in the area of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately after witnessing the object we also saw a normal plane in the sky, and in comparison the two are very different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We only observed one of the orbs. The witness is 54 and a male and was also witnessed by his 18 year old daughter and he called out his 20 year old son.  He is a life long citizen of Munising, Michigan and has seen a few unreported UFO sightings in his life, but has never seen any quite like this.  Also in our area we have multiple (anywhere from 5-25) of another type of &#34;light&#34; in the sky.  They have moved across the whole sky in instances and always blink red, white, and green.  They don’t appear to be satellites and are sometimes even in a kite formation.  On various nights they are completely unmoving or not even there, and other times they will slide around.  Once the first one was sighted we have seen many since and are there almost every night.  We aren’t saying these are UFOs but that we can’t explain them, and with the UFO sighted last night we feel they should be mentioned as there could (if the lights we see every night are something UFO related) be a connection.<n>

About 10 minutes later the object reappeared this time it would pulsate, then blink out then flash then blink out again moving from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it blinked out for the last time a second object (may have been same one unsure) appeared back in the firsts original location and did the same thing in the exact same path before streaking off like a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about another half an hour the object appeared once more this time moving in the opposite path as it originally did then blinked out, about ten minutes went by and it appeared for the last time this time it was much brighter before blinking out and not coming back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where I was sitting all of the objects were moving around and in the square part of the big dipper (it did move out of the formation but that is where I spotted it each time at the beginning).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each time it was spotted several aircraft would circle the area to include a helicopter that I heard but could not see.<n>

We were driveing down highway 19 when I looked east toward the city of Caldwell and Boise when a small white light slowly appeared about the size of a star initially thought it was a plane but then notice that it was stationary stared at the light for 20 to 30 seconds when it made a fast dip downward then up similar to a check mark path. light accelerated with incredible speed whole event lasted only 20 to 30 seconds and appeared in the east to south east of the sky over the cites of Caldwell, Nampa, and Boise<n>

A peer of mine and myself were walking through his/her yard and in the close distance saw a white spherical light was moving across the horizon.  The object moved in a straight smooth motion at a very steady slow speed.  After about a minute or two of watching the object, it suddenly vanished.  I did not see streak marks of light indicating it moving across the sky at an accelerated speed, however I suggest it went invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As mentioned before, the sightings have occurred on different dates and throughout many years.  A few of the objects have been seen in groups of two, but no more than two.  I have seen other objects (exactly as previously described) stay in the same position for more than a half hour not moving before it finally vanished before my eyes.  I am not the only witness to these events in the area.  I do not assume it is any kind of alien UFO.  I would just like to report the incident and see if anybody has experienced any of these events in the Norfolk County region of Mass.<n>
7/21/09 18:15|Lakeland|FL|Cigar|5 mins|It was evening, I was standing outside my townhouse looking at the orange sky. I noticed in the eastern direction what, at first glance|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74841.html|185|ndxe200907| It was evening, I was standing outside my townhouse looking at the orange sky. I noticed in the eastern direction what, at first glance, seemed to be a jet or rocket. However, it was not moving as fast, it was remaining completely parallel to the horizon. Plus it did not have the trail of smoke that lasted forever trailing behind it. It seemed to have a light, quickly vanishing tail. I watched it for a few minutes before I ran inside and got my husband to come look. He followed quickly behind me out the door where I pointed the still there object out to him. Approximately 1 full minute passed and the thing disappeared. The light smoke trail followed insuit. I have very strong fewelings that this was no jet nor rocket. I have seen jets and I am 100% positive, this was not a jet or plane. Ok, so. This is literally burned into my brain, why a perfect parallel shot along the horizon, not really high, not really low...but far away from me. Basically if Im on the ! N. Socrum in Lakeland, the thing was probably directly over Lake Mirror. I don&#39;t know, but seeing another sighting on your site made me think even harder. Description seems pretty close to what I saw, same time, day, direction??!!<n>

I didn&#39;t even realize that this shape, light was taken.  I had 3 pictures I had taken.  When I enlarged the picture noticing the light, I noticed the shape.  I&#39;ve had people look at it, and advised me to send to verify.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appears to have a dome shaped at the top, with light and a trail like it was shooting up.  I was facing West, so it wasn&#39;t the space shuttle, which people had asked :)  I appreciate you taking the time to read and look at this picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please if you could let me know if this picture is worth of keeping or a throw-away!  Thanks...<n>

I took off my sunglasses and still saw a cigar shaped object aprox 300 or 400 feet long.  Basically the color was grey and seemed to fade in and out while emitting no sound.  It appeared to be about 1000 yards away, moving slowly and aprox 1/4 mile above ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short while the object became very visible and shot away at a speed that was unbelievable.  I and my wife and myself observed possible UFO&#39;s in Pa in the late 80&#39;s but not of this sort.  This was not an imagination event or a mistaken plane, this was the real thing.  I had dropped my clippers and looked around for anyone else, but no one was present.  I was shaken but believed what I saw and knew again that we wern&#39;t by ourselves.<n>

7/21/09 15:30|Bellvue|CO|Oval||Dark oval object noticed in pics taken NW of Ft Collins|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71245.html|189|ndxe200907| Dark oval object noticed in pics taken NW of Ft Collins<n> <n><n> <n><n> While out driving around sightseeing and whatnot with my wife on 7/21/09 northwest of Ft Collins, just west of the tiny town of Bellvue, I stopped and took several pictures of the somewhat rare greenery of the foothills due to the abundant rain this year.  I noticed a commercial airliner contrail headed WSW while taking the picture but paid it no attention.  When we got home I popped the camera card into the computer to tweak the light and contrast levels when I noticed a black dot on one of the pics that was facing west towards the foothills.  I zoomed in and noticed a black oval. I dismissed the possibility of it being a bird or plane because as you can see in the attached pics, the camera picked up cloud details nearby that are actually smaller than the object.  To me this indicates that at that level of magnification, wings would be seen if it was a plane or bird.  Additionally, if it was a blur of a bird in flight, there still would be areas of lighter or darker shades where light would reflect off wing, head, leg or abdomen surfaces no matter how blurred it may be.  There appears to be none of these as the object shows a consistent dark shade.  There does however appear to be an area of lighter shade along the top of the object, possibly implying sunlight reflecting off the top surface.  No other objects were noticed in any of the remaining pics and no other strange effects or events were noticed at the time.  I did not zoom in further in the supplied pics because any detail would just be lost in enlarged pixels.<n>

A few moments later I noticed they had stopped moving.  At first I thought they had just moved past the horizon.  Considering the speed and distance to the trees below I quickly ruled that out. When I got up to make sure it wasn&#39;t an asteroid or space junk they started up again.  They moved independently of each other and a third (dimmer or farther) light appeared.  With in a few more seconds one quickly headed south and out of sight and the other two continued in strange little &#34;loops&#34; speeding up before entering behind some clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an amateur astronomer and I am pretty sure it wasn&#39;t anything burning up in our atmosphere or Jupiter or Saturn.  They moved just a little too awkwardly to be planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure what it was, just thought I would post it here in case anyone else saw it.<n>

We ran downstairs and my Mother-in-law, Father-in-law, Sister-in-law, my friend, and I stood on the back porch as we witnessed the most incredible thing that any of us have ever seen in our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the night sky we saw a shining red craft with an almost halo shaped red pulsing light around it.  It had no directional path to it and began to move across the sky slowly and decreasing in size as if it were going up into the atmosphere.  It was completely silent outside and it was closer than a normal flying plane.  After about five minutes it was very far up in the sky and had become very small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually it went away, then it came back in to sight for a moment.  We all could not believe our eyes.   My Father-in-law is a knowledgeable ex-air force pilot and has built and flown planes for over 20 years.  He was the one who identified it in the sky.  We are all now believers.<n>

I wanted to at least go on record as having witnessed the following on July 21st at approximately 7:45 am (the incident only lasted about 25 seconds and I did not have a camera):<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling eastbound in my car on Wrights rd in Newtown Bucks County toward the Peter Taylor farmstead where I was going to pick up produce for our farm stand.  I had noticed three parallel chemtrails high in the sky running from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a bright light caught my eye next to the chemtrail closest to me.  At first I thought it might be an airplane with the sun reflecting off of it, but the brightness of the object and its flight path convinced me otherwise.  The object travelled alongside the one chemtrail, then shifted into it and back out.  At this time, a second object appeared (same size same brightness)  They spiraled once around the chemtrail and then quickly changed direction and seemed to disappear from sight.  It is difficult to estimate the size of the objects since they were high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The chemtrails were fairly new since the one they were flying around was being formed at that time.(the jet was at least a half mile away from the objects.  I woul! d estimate that the diameter of the objects were approximately 1/6 to 1/8 the width of the chemtrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went on line the next morning to research any similar types of sightings (chemtrails with ufos).  I found several cases and therefore I wanted to add my experience to the database.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any questions please contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a high school teacher and I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are aware that many people accept the &#34;chemtrail&#34; phenomenon as being real, but we at NUFORC are unconvinced of their existence.  Rather, we suspect that they all are simply &#34;contrails,&#34; i.e. condensation trails, behind high-altitude aircraft.  PD))<n>

I saw a moving light way up in the  Northwestern sky.   It appeared to arc upward then was gone.   I did notice an airplane coming out of the west right after.   I have never seen just one light like I saw, especially one that disappeared as like leaving the Earth’s atmosphere.   I thought it was a plane till I saw it just vanish.   I really hope that what I saw was a UFO.   I couldn’t make out any shape since the craft was so high up.<n>

This little orange ball of light was definitely at high altitude.  I’m very big with aviation so the first thing I noticed is that it was not blinking any colors or white lights, like the aircraft around it near the same altitude were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my friend watched the mysterious orange light, which I thought was just a plane, flying across the sky.  As soon as it all most came over us the orange ball of light stopped and suddenly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In shock, my friend and I waited for 5 minutes looking around the sky for the little orange ball of light that was right above us a moment before, but could not seem to find it again.  Then suddenly me and my friend spotted 2 more moving objects moving northwest were to little white dots, looked like stars almost, again very high altitude but seemed very close for high altitude aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 little white lights that were not as bright as the orange light.  They again were way to close then anything I have ever seen, and were moving at the same speed same directing.<n>

7/20/09 22:15|Eugene|OR|Light|5 Minutes|Something is going on in Eugene, Oregon.  Many sighting from many people across many months.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71218.html|199|ndxe200907| Something is going on in Eugene, Oregon.  Many sighting from many people across many months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something is going on in Eugene Oregon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you read the reports for Eugene/Springfield, Oregon, many people are reporting the same type of sighting.  These reports are spread across many months/years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the UFO last night on a walk in west Eugene.   Was a bright light moving across the sky from west to east.  This was about 5 miles south of the Eugene airport and directly in the landing/takeoff path of aircraft from the airport.  If you look at a map of the airport you will see the main runway runs north to south, so this UFO crossed directly across the path of normal air traffic.  I haven&#39;t see an airplane ever move in an west to east pattern this close to the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Craft details.  I have no idea how to judge the height or speed of the UFO.  It was much too bright and moving to slow to be a satellite.  We did see satellite about 10 minutes after the UFO was gone for comparison.  The craft flew directly over head and was completely silent.  As it moved east, it finally sped up and was not visible any longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 30 minutes, we either saw the same UFO or one that looked exactly like it.  It was moving south to north at a rapid pace, but was far to the east of us.  An airplane with blinking light was moving in the opposite direction at the same time, but the UFO was much quicker and appeared to be at a much lower altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also believe we saw this UFO on July 4th.  We were north of the Eugene Airport by 10 miles.  The light appeared to be south of the Airport and stopped hovered for about 10 minutes.  Then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would assume this UFO is some sort of manmade device, but it is very hard to speculate on its speed and height as there is nothing to use as a reference.  It also does not follow the normal traffic pattern of aircraft that frequent the airport.<n>

Multiple blinking lights flying out over the ocean from the south (Sea Isle City).  Lights dissapeared out at sea (over 15 miles out).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly thereafter orange lights would glow bright and dissapear.  This happened 2 nights in a row at the same time (2200-2400).<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 07/25/09, blinking lights confirmed as US aircraft as they appeared over head on the mainland.  Developed an elliptical pattern from Atlantic City to just south of Ocean City.  Bright orange lights are suspected to be flares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 07/24/09 @ 2200, a string of lights about 1 minute apart appeared to elevate from the sea level to about 10,000 ft.  Light trajectory was from the south of OC heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx 12 of these lights were launched in succession.  I observed through binoculars and saw what appeared to be a chute or balloon of some sort trailing behind the light, clearly it was attached.  I&#39;ve never seen weather balloons but these were most likely that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights then faded out and objects could not be seen anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With Fort Dix and the FAA within 30 miles, I suspect military exercises of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was making no sounds of any kind and when it moved from west to the east it wasn’t a|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71252.html|201|ndxe200907| Please note that my knowledge of flying aircraft is enough to be able to clearly identify most military aircraft openly used, commercial aircraft for air cargo/passenger usage, private aircraft, and kit /ultralight  aircraft used openly today.  Having said that, what I and two other people, saw last night was clearly a UFO as it’s flight characteristics, shape, engine, and course defies normal know aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also note that  I’m former military, Commercial Law Enforcement, and of sound mind and body with Pilot vision with corrective glasses on (I was warring my new prescription glasses).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The below state of events is true and factual to the best of my knowledge. The tempture in Yamhill County during the day was in the lower 90’s and where I live about 3 miles north of the town of Yamhill on State Hwy 47 the wind was picking up and I decided to go outside and let the dogs play and water some plants, a new maple tree, and some rose bushes while letting the house cool down for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just completed watering the tree, my landlord&#39;s son had some guest come by earlier and they were leaving.  As they were leaving I walked to the west corner of the front porch and began to water the rose bush.  It was a beautiful night, not a cloud in the sky and all the stars were shinning bright.  I looked up and toward the west hills of the small valley where I live and saw a bright white sphere shaped object moving across the sky at a low altitude and making no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now you have to understand aircraft of all types fly over the house all the time and some at low altitude and in all directions.  I’m close to the McMinnville Airport, Port of Portland Hillsboro Airport which can both handle jet liners (up to 747-100 @ McMinnville and  757 @ Hillsboro)  plus the house is on the glide path for final at the Portland International Airport.  I can see their tail markings without the use of binoculars.   When the jets come in on a PDX vector it’s south to north and their landing lights are on and at night the lights project forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was not projecting light forward.  It was making no sounds of any kind and when it moved from west to the east it wasn’t a smooth glide it was jagged.  I stepped back as it started across the house so I could get a better look.  I kept saying, “ what the hell is that thing.”  I called out for landlord’s son as loud as I could. When he came out of his home I just said,  “ look . . . . . . . . !” and point up in the sky at the object. I then said, “ listen . . . . . . no sound.”  He agree and about a that time is when his wife came out to see what all the commotion was about and he pointed up and said, “look at this.”  His wife said, “ It’s not flying to straight is it?” I replied , “no it’s not.” Now the object was not flying over the house, north of the home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes the craft was over my landlord&#39;s son’s house and still heading east.  This is when I notice a regular aircraft, flying higher than the object (at least 10,000 feet higher) and in the same direction and that gave me some distance reference and scale as that aircraft was at about 33,000 feet or higher and the object was much lower than that.  Still moving without sound and in a jagged direction, the object cleared the landlord&#39;s son’s home and was heading of the west hills of this small valley.   As it crossed over it disappeared (vanished) with out any type of marker lights from behind it.  I stood there with the landlord’s son and we where comparing what we had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s when I became scared for the first time sense the death of my wife.  My thoughts are one of come up with some kind of logical kind of answer to what I just saw. &#34;If I saw what I think I saw . . . . . . . . it’s not real . . . . . . is it?&#34;  &#34;What if it comes back?&#34;  I stayed out side looking up for about a half hour and then it dawned on me to call the police non emergency line and report what I had seen.  I called Yamhill County  Communication Center (YCOM) and he contacted a sheriff’s Deputy and he in turned called me and left a message with y! our (National UFO Reporting Center) phone number as he didn’t know how the handle such a report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Called National UFO Reporting Center and left a message on your service and request a investigator to contact me with respect to the above.<n>

Report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> U.F.O Sighting:  It was about two in the mourning when I decided to leave my friend’s house after watching a movie with him.  When I went out side to go get in my car that I parked right inside the condominium were he lives just about less than 20 ft away, we discussed several things about graphic design and computer animation.  As we’re talking, I noticed something out in the corner of my eye. I didn’t look immediately but it was only until my friend said, &#34;Hey, what is that?&#34; and pointed at it that I decided to twist my neck to look at it.  It was about 20 ft from us and next to a light fixture hovering in the vicinity of the light.  It seemed to be what looked like of a  metallic material, saucer shaped, &#34;gunmetal&#34; (a popular car rim color) in color, and all around it had the kind of ridges and curves that you find on a pecan or brain.  It was emanating dim lights around it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my friend pointed at it, it just took off north bound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was not moving just hovering there. So when I went to film it with my camera in the video on the screen there was three big bright lights that were not moving. But without the camera there’s only one light. I photographed the sighting with a video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were looking in the sky attempting to identify constellations, studying for an astronomy class.  There is a significant amount of light pollution in the area.  I was looking north or northwest, and my friend was looking southeast.  He mentioned that I should look where he was looking.  I looked southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both observed two extremely bright points of light.  One light appeared vertically above the other light.  They were not moving at all.  My first impression was that they were just extremely bright stars, and I looked into my book to try to find them.  I looked back up a few seconds later and they were gone.  There was no sound.  Both points of light were the same brightness, and appeared to be much brighter than any star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I walked outside on my patio early that morning and looked up at the stars in the clear predawn sky.  I turned my head to the left and at that moment I noticed a bright light, maybe twice the size of Venus.  The light appeared to be moving right at me even though very high up and it seems that as it noticed that I was looking straight at it, it then began to move backwards and then to go up even higher until it finally became non-visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So many thoughts went through my head at a rapid speed regarding what I might have thought this thing to be as I was looking at it.  I knew that it couldn’t be a satellite because it was just too bright and because of the way that it had just suddenly reversed itself and went straight up till it disappeared.  I have never seen satellites behave that way.  There were no running lights, no port or starboard lights on what I was seeing.  It was just a big ball of light.  The light also seemed to be sort of flickering at the center.  I say flicker, but I mean that it was more like if one were to take some crinkled tin foil and move it around in the hand just slightly so that it throws light reflections around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There actually was a car going by at exactly the same time that I saw this light in the sky.  I remember thinking as it happened that the lights on this car could be reflecting on something and causing this light in the sky, but quickly dismissed that idea since the car was down below me and on the street behind my apartment, which is on the second level, and the bright light I saw in the sky seemed too high up to be a reflection from anything on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting affected me in a very unfamiliar way.  I feel that my reaction to it was very instinctual and quick. I became very afraid as I stood there watching it move up into non-visibility.  I think the hair on my arms stood up and that it made my skin crawl.  The one thing that really got to me was that I felt this light was being stealthy and creeping in on me and when I turned my head to look at it, it just backed away, as though it knew that I was looking at it and sort of catching it in the act.  I felt like a frightened animal, or a cornered animal.  I then just gave up on watching it disappear and bolted back inside.  Upon entering I looked at the clock and it was 4 a.m.  My clock on the wall is two minutes fast, so the actual time was more like 3:58 a.m.<n>

After dinner we laid out some blankets on the sand a few hundred yards away from the Pier. It was a quiet night despite some celebratory camp fires going on. As we laid back, looking at the stars, listening to the ocean, we noticed the two of the stars were moving back and forth and occasional they moved to the side but did so fairly quick. No sound came from these &#34;stars,&#34; but they did shine a tad brighter than the rest of the stationary stars they were around. One thing we did notice before my lady friend got so nervous she demanded we leave, was that when planes flew near these &#34;stars&#34; the stars would move away from the planes a good distance and then stop for a while before deciding to move again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever these things were, they made no sound but moved seamlessly through the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, the beach was dark and the sky was clear, we had a great shot of whatever these things were. There was a helicopter and several airplanes overhead. Quite a few commercial. There was only one plane (non-commercial, I believe) that got close to these things and that&#39;s when they moved away from potential contact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About three weeks ago I did hear about these &#34;stars&#34; or UFO&#39;s posing as stars on Coast to Coast AM by a guy who lives in the desert that has been using high-beam light to signal them and they signal back and move-in when engaged. I am trying desperately to find an answer out of all this as to what it might be, but my lady friend got so upset she almost threw-up and couldn&#39;t stop shaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll admit, it made me nervous, also. I immediately thought of that broadcast and what was said and felt I too had witnessed the same thing. Real stars DON&#39;T move that quick, backwards and forwards and react to planes.<n>

The object was flying away from us but then turned around and seemed to hover over a few areas and stopped then continued its flight passed us. The only way I can describe the flashing is as if the object was taking photographs, we could vaguely hear the sound of a helicopter.

Looking out south to east from coast of Tenerife.  Just on our balcony of hotel and looking at the clear night sky. Looking at stars and focused on one particular that flickered slightly of which for a second I thought was a satellite.  The object then moved in a flash to a point across the sky then stopped for a nano second and changed direction of 90 degrees then back across the sky. Stopped again for a nano second and then across again.  This repeated about 6 times in total until out of sight. Every journey to each point must be about 1 second maximum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to describe was that it did a zig zag formation across the sky as if it was plotting motion until disappearing.  From the distance I was the object was of a small star.  I could not see any detail of the object but could make out a triangular shape.  Assuming the breadth of vision on a clear sky overlooking the Atlantic, the difference between each point before zig zag to the next point must have been hundreds of miles so the speed and change of distance was not conceivable of anything I could comprehend.<n>

The sky was very clear and the stars were bright. We could see the Milky Way and observed a satellite going over traveling south to north, and a jet airliner with red and white lights traveling northwest toward Calgary (3 hour car drive northwest).  We saw a couple of shooting stars to the southwest.  We then observed what appeared to be another satellite – but it was traveling what we noticed was kinda the wrong direction - north to south/southwest.  We thought it seemed odd.  There were only 4 of us really looking up. The other two were under a small lattice awning in the back yard of the home and didn&#39;t see what we were seeing.  I watched the “satellite” for about 5 seconds and then looked north a little bit and saw a small bunch of what I thought were faint stars – but then realized they were moving…in formation following the larger “satellite” and getting closer and closer. I shouted to the others to look and 3 of the others, ages 19, 10, and 40 (I am 48) viewed the same thing I did for approximately 1 more minute:  The formation was about 8 or 9 dim lights smaller than the larger light and they were in two V/type shapes that moved together but the V’s then bowed /morphed into more of two U shaped formations but random in their placement, not symmetrical…all the same size and dimly lit, following the larger light.  The larger light stopped or rather slowed way down and the smaller groups got closer and closer, then they were all out of sight. My 10 year old kept watching the general area then said she saw, for about 3 seconds, two small faint clusters and then 2 lines of light between them then they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A large glowing cloud emerged from the tree line.  I even mentioned that it looked like a comet to my freind.  He agreed that it was strange seeing such a large glowing star cloud in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is when things got even stranger.  The cloud began to take shape and was soon the brightest light in the night sky.  It was a differnt color of light than the stars in the night sky.  The color was of a yellowish glow and at least 5 times if not more the brightness of any other star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called on my wife and son to come see what they thought it was.  The light appeared to move before all in witness.  I grabbed my camerea and was able to take 2 photos.  I took both photos using the zoom on my camera and tried using a chair and a cooler to stablize my camera.  The light was the only visible light to even be picked up on my camera.  Before I could take a third the brightness faded to where it was no longer visible on my camera.(within 30 seconds)  It soon began to look like a comet in the sky.

It appeared white to one of us, but the other thought it was orange, possibly from the sun reflection.  It was quite a bit above a jet plane that we watched come from the south and crossed above the plane’s path.  The plane was at about 25,000 feet that was flying in a northwest direction. The UFO was at about 50,000 feet and moved without any sign of white streaks from the engines.  The skies were clear and cloudless.  The jet plane left a white trail, and we watched this plane for two to three minutes.  Another plane was traveling perpendicular to the first plane, and also left a white trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time was approximately 19:50, when we watched an UFO coming from the north and moved southeast for about 45 seconds and then turned south for about minute.  It seemed to pause for about 20 to 30 seconds in one spot, and then it headed east for approximately one minute.

The moon was not yet showing and there were no clouds in the sky. I saw a brightly lit object in the sky several finger widths above the horizon and wondered which planet it was since it was too large to be a star or if I was actually seeing a satellite or the space station.  To the right of the object I saw what I thought was a plane flashing a very intense green navigation light.  I say intense because it was “starring”. As I watched it, the green flashing changed in color and flashing pattern. The color changed from a light green through the color spectrum to a purple between flashes or it glowed a few seconds changing colors.  The flashing pattern wasn&#39;t steady. I studied the object several minutes perceiving that its flight path was stalling, then changing course by several degrees, then correcting to its original course.  To make sure I wasn’t seeing things I went inside to ask my brother in law to look at it as well.  I thought I was seriously seeing things.  As he came outside it was still very high in altitude but closer to us.  We both stood in my driveway looking at the object continue to change: color, light intensity, speed, and minute direction. Its general course was to the Northwest. At this time we had been watching it for 9 minutes and it was just past directly overhead.  I was expecting to see the red navigation light or an anti-collision light but there weren’t any.  It stopped and hovered at a very high altitude for several minutes. About this time a neighbor was coming outside to get in his car and drive somewhere.  He paused for a moment looking at my bother in law am I staring at the sky above us.  Then he looked up through his windshield and promptly rolled down his window asking us what that was that we all were looking at. He said, &#34;I don’t think it’s a plane.&#34;  To which we both said, &#34;Not sure yet, but it could be.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we said that it started moving directly to the south.  It didn’t make a rolling turn.  There was no normal aircraft movement in that you would normally see.  Even a fast break with speed flaps does not turn 140 degrees to the left instantly.  It continued on the southern course and a much faster rate of speed and appeared to be getting smaller.  Then it suddenly disappeared or stopped flashing.  As it did so, the stars in the area started to all blink in unison.  They blinked like this for several minutes then did the normal blinking from atmospheric condition if you will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a background in military aviation maintenance and as a flight observer on helicopters.  I have flown over 450 hours of night flights both aided and unaided.  I was a weapons instructor for 2 years.

They were in some formation and then broke apart and 2 began to fly southwest...I thought they were going to collide they came so close to eachother but then they just passed by one another and I turned my attention to the others and they were just moving so slowly and haphazardly that I called my husband outside....He and my 6 year old son came out and became engrossed in the lights as well...there was no sound at all...  Some would just all of a sudden flicker and disappear...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my neighbor who is a pilot and he came outside with his wife...He said he&#39;s never seen anything like it either.  The lights eventually dimmed and disappeared..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw 4 bright WHITE lights hanging in the sky NW of our home in the distance.   They were equally spaced in a horizontal formation tilted up from bottom left to top right.  The lights faded in and out several times.  They also circled around one another several times, before going back into a horizontal line formation.  At one point they all came together in a focused point.  They fanned back out into the horizontal slanted formation.  Then, as though you were shutting off the lights, they disappeared one after another.  The height of the lights was a ½ a story above the sight line of the closest home, approximately 200 yds. away.  I’m not a UFO believer, but I can’t think of any rational explanation for what I saw.  Cloud cover is extremely low at ~1000 feet.  Of note, the Dayton air show IS in town and toward that direction, BUT the ended today at 5:00 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amanda I noticed 4 bright lights in a line.  They remained in a line approximately 15-30 seconds after I first noticed them.  I was looking North/Northwest from the deck that is approximately 12’ off of the ground (ground is elevated from a pond).  I noticed the lights begin to move and seemed to orbit around one another when I mentioned that to my friends.  The lights began rotating around and additionally, starting to move in a non-linear pattern.  The lights started flashing.  Specifically, the farthest light from the front and/or on the right began flashing on and off.  This lasted approximately 1 minute.  The lights moved further west and then they began to flash on and off in sequence; each one time on and then off.  At the very end, the lights flashed off, one light at a time until all the lights were off.  The lights were bright and resembled a street light without the aura around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is Cheri F and I live in Lebanon, OH. I was sitting on my back deck tonight (Sat, July 18) when we noticed 4 odd lights in the distance, northwest of our house. They were the strangest things I’ve ever seen. When we first saw them, I ran inside and grabbed the camera to take video. They seemed to move in a snake-like formation. One would fade away and then reappear on the other end. I’ve been to numerous air shows and come from a history of air force veterans/pilots and these didn’t move like anything I’ve ever seen before. They kind of floated/hovered but seemed to move very fast when they did move. They didn’t twinkle or flash, they were just solid orbs of light. There definitely seemed to be a “leader” among the lights. We watched as they moved into the distance, converged into one, broke back out and then disappeared one at a time like lights switching off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> RJ S On the evening of July 18th, I was at my friend Andy’s house in Lebanon, Ohio.  I was on Andy’s deck with him and his wife Cheryl and my girlfriend Amanda.  Amanda noticed something in the sky and directed our attention to it.  At first glance, it appeared to be airplanes.  I know that the Dayton, OH air show was today, so I assumed that it was just some planes from that event.  However, upon further observation it didn’t appear to be like any plane or formation I had ever seen.  There were four “planes,” each having one bright white-ish light (pretty sure that most planes have lights on both wing and the tail).  They traveled in an “S” formation in a North-Northwest direction, with the back “4th” plane’s light slowing dimming to “off” and then turning back on.  The “planes” were traveling faster than typical planes and seemed to be flying low in the air – there have been a lot of clouds in the sky today and the planes were well below the clouds.  As the planes flew away, the first plane’s light disappeared, then the lights from the second, third and finally fourth.  They didn’t turn back on after this point – as if the planes just disappeared.  I observed the planes for probably 2-2:30 minutes before they disappeared.<n>
7/18/09 21:15|Albany|OR|Changing|5 minutes|UFO over I-5 near Albany, Oregon on 7/18/2009.|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71494.html|241|ndxe200907| UFO over I-5 near Albany, Oregon on 7/18/2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the evening as we were heading north on I-5 about 10 miles south of the Corvallis exit, we saw a strange cloud-like shape in the sky.  It was strange because it was darker than the few other clouds in the sky that were lighted from behind due to the setting sun.  It was also much, much lower and a had a very distinct full shape as opposed to the other clouds that were high, thin and flat in the sky that are typical in Oregon on hot summer days.  We both saw the object and began to discuss what we thought it was.  At first we thought that maybe it was a cloud, and then maybe a helicopter, but it was difficult to decide at first.  As the object got closer we realized that it was distinctly changing shape.  It would be wide and round and then stretch and thin out.  Then after about 5 minutes of watching it, the object distinctly began moving away from us.  It headed north, which we were already travelling 70 mph in the same direction, which shows that it was! moving at a significantly high velocity.  Then over the span of about 5 seconds the object disappeared.  It did not move out of sight due to distance but faded or dissolved from sight from the edges in. This was very clear and when we realized that what we saw was not normal and not anything that we could identify except as extraterrestrial.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a skeptic I never thought I would ever see a UFO, however I cannot explain what I saw in any other manner than something beyond this world.  I have tried to find others who may have also seen this because I-5 is a very busy freeway and was so close to the city of Albany.  If we had not both witness this strange experience then I may have not believed what my own eyes had seen.  It was strange to think about this other possibility of UFOs, those that do not emit light and appear to try to blend into the surroundings.  It greatly changed what I think about the possibility of something out there that is from beyond our world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  I spoke via telephone with this witness, and she was quite eloquent, and sounded to us to be quite objective and sober-minded.

I witnessed Red Orange luminous objects flying from northwest to southwest.  There was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 luminous objects, and disappearing as they go southwest. Another group formed a line of 5 with equal distance.  One of those objects broke off going west and another one went east. Next, 5 more objects flew in the same pattern. Then 4 objects together flew in a diamond formation.  One of the four seemed illuminated brighter than the others within the group.  I saw these objects in a clear night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the unidentified flying objects flew over the area the dogs in the neighborhood began to bark. I did not recognize any sirens going off at the time. These objects did not have any engine sounds coming from them like a conventional plane, military aircraft or helicopter.  There was no starboard, port, or flashing lights emitting from these objects.  They stayed in a consistent glow except for one that came at the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have seen these white lights on many occassions (maybe 4 or 6 times), I never reported them for fear of being called silly. The white lights would always take the same pattern; a triangle shape~five white lights total.  The lights would change colors from light blue, then light orange then back to a white light but they would always stay in their pattern. The lights would hoover in the distance over a field, in a very isolated area between the two countries.  This area where the lights hoover, no one travels into, not even the border patrol~it&#39;s just too isolated; not even cell phones work out here. The lights would hoover for minutes then as they speed off, two lights would go off north, two would go off south and the lead light would go east (S/E)~this is way I say it&#39;s a formation of five lights. My last sighting, this eveni! ng, my son&#39;s flash light and binoculors where in the back seat of my vehicle. I used the binoculars to get a closer look at them, at the same time I used the flash light to signal them.  As I focused on the lights (crafts) I could sense they were looking back; I flashed the flash light to get their attention and one of the lights(craft) flickered its light back. At first, I refused to believe they were focusing back at me or signaling me with thier lights.  I continued to focused with the binoculars but the next time I flashed the flash light,I came up with a particular pattern; three long flash, followed by two short flashed, then one long flash and then one short flash.   However, this time all five lights (crafts) flashed their lights at the exact time and in the same pattern!  Now, my self preservation heighten I no longer wanted to play with the lights (crafts)so I put the flast light back in the back seat, but I continue to look with the binoculars at the lights ~ but! longer I looked the stronger the feeling I got (they were loo! king bac k),till it became overwhelming and I put the binoculars down!  I must have looked at the white lights (crafts)maybe 2-3 minutes; during this time frame ~ the five lights (crafts) flickered their lights back to me twice in the same pattern I made up.  When I looked up without the aid of my binoculars the lights were gone, I didn&#39;t see them fly off like I normally seen them and this freaked me out.  Even though I couldn&#39; see the light(crafts), I sense they were still around. I didn&#39;t want to stick around to find out. On my way home, I stopped at HEB and went shopping, then I stopped at an ice house to buy a beer, went the long way home ~ I guess to throw them off (right!).  About a mile or so from my house, my son&#39;s flash light starting blinking(flashing)!!  I really would have chalked it up as being nothing, but the flashing light pattern was the one I made up for those crafts in the sky.  Of course, I through out the flash light and the binoculars, I bought my son some other! ones.  I pulled up to my house, about 10 minutes later, stepped out of my pick-up and looked up into the night sky to see a beautiful Texas&#39; starry night.  I took a second look into the night, just before I stepped into my house; I saw a triangle pattern of no stars over my house maybe the size of a football field, my front door closed. I immediately open my door again to take a third look but the dark triangle silohuet was gone, the stars were back.  I just wanted to tell you my story, you know~just in case.  I have not been out there since this incident, I have been taking my wife&#39;s car to work and taking another route home, but I am willing to make another trip out there to take pictures, video and sound track if it would help?  Just do not mention my name. You can email, but I will not talk or see anyone. Andromeda<n>

Elevation of the site is about 6500 feet. This is accessible by 4 wheel drive or ATV from Tampico Washington about twenty miles to the east. (Yakima is 30 miles to the east)   We had seen occasional air traffic throught the day, the latest being a C-17 overflying the area from west to east at approximately 1900.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was  preparing dinner around when my friend asked me to identify an “airplane” he was watching.  He pointed out a dark colored triangular flying wing with a span of about 25 feet and a depth of around 6 feet.  When it was pointed out to me it was coming toward us from the west (traveling west to east)  at more or less our altitude. It approached our position eventually overflying us at an altitude of about 500 feet AGL and made a rather leisurely turn to the north and continued along the ridge line eventually moving out of sight in the general direction of Rimrock lake which we could just barley see about ten miles to our north.  Through the whole encounter its speed remained quite low.  I estimate it was moving about 50mph.   My impression was of more or less highway speed.  If I&#39;m correct this is most likely too slow for aerodynamic lift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We passed the night uneventfully and returned home the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I at first assumed this was an unmanned aircraft but it had no marking or visible control surfaces. When it turned it did not visibly bank.  Even from directly underneath it was completely silent and its surface showed no visible details of any kind, no jet exhaust, no intakes, no landing gear doors.  When it was approaching I got a decent look at it through binoculars and saw no obvious intakes anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my opinion it exceeds the state of the art, and I have no idea what would posses anyone to operate such a craft in that time and place unless they are trying to be seen.  thus my decision to report it here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description: Dark colored triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> L: about 15 feet W: about 25 feet H: about 6 feet Speed about 50mph  Thicker at the front than at the back (airfoil shaped) No marking or visible means of propulsion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sign of control surfaces.<n>

It appear to be a white color and did appear to reflect light.  No wings, lights or other features. Speed was about that of an airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The unusual thing is that it did not make any sound.  No engine or air sound at all.  I could not determine how high up it was but about 3 minutes later, I saw a commercial airliner traveling approximately the same path as it was leaving Bradley International airport.  If that&#39;s any help.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration about 1 minute.<n>

I noticed two particular &#34;stars&#34; that were very near each other.  I saw one start moving to the north in an arc while the other one stayed still.  Then the second &#34;star&#34; moved to the west, also in an arc. Due to the trees, I lost the second one behind the high pine trees.  However, my boyfriend followed the first until it faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes later, I spot another moving &#34;star&#34; and then the fourth another five minutes after that. I know for a fact that our government does not have aircraft that can fly that high in our atmosphere at a constant high rate speed.  I call them &#34;stars&#34; because that is how they looked due to being so high up in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the moving &#34;stars&#34;, my boyfriend sees a very bright light.  A light too bright to be a planet. Also, there was no &#34;twinkling&#34; to it, but a pulsating light.  We know where Venus is in relation to the moon as well as Mars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every night, my boyfriend and I watch the skies and wish aloud that there was no light pollution to affect our view.  He went home to tell his family about it and to show them the bright, pulsating &#34;star&#34;. They too have confirmed that it is &#34;moving&#34; across the sky at a faster rate than the Moon, Venus, and the North Star.<n>

From our car, one passenger and myself spotted a glowing light in the sky.  It was a long horizontal band of light that looked to be spinning.  It hovered in the air a few miles away from where we were parked in the hills and looked as if it was levitating.  It was a fairly bright saucer-shaped light that seemed to accelerate and get smaller before completely disappearing into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire episode lasted about 3-4 minutes and we could not think of any logical explanation for the unique shape and characteristics of the lights.<n>

I thought,why would there be a helicopter out this time of day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it just went up, down,sideways,it just seemed to dance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my spotting scope out and saw it had blue-like a translucent blue light,and red, flashing all around it.

I presume it was over Lake Washington, or in that area. It was disc shaped with a squarish dome on top. It did not have any lights on it like a plane, but it was lit up. I immediately showed the person next to me as we watched it fly off in a chaotic zig zag. It moved very fast and had extremely sharp turns to think it was a plane. I remember it to have an orange color, the other remembers it silver. I guess it was a mile away when I first saw it, but was out of sight within 15 seconds. There wasn’t any sound, but we were in my apartment.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Flying in co-ordinate formation then breaking formation and slowly fading into nothing before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Friday night July 19 at about 00:10hrs, in north London, I noticed a very bright light through my closed Venetian blinds. As there was no sound I realized it could not be a helicopter and therefore pulled the blinds up to see what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my surprise I saw 8 lights moving roughly as high as a Helicopter would. They were brighter than any light on a plane and were static with no blinking what so ever. The objects were spherical and unlike a plane or helicopter of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The way and direction they were traveling was very odd. They were all moving horizontally at very slow speed, in what appeared to be an organized formation. They were in two groups. A group of 3 led and a group of 5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching these crafts for a couple of minutes, they seemed to individually break formation and start moving higher up and away from us. The once extremely bright spheres began to slowly fade away right before our eyes until it they completely gone!  There were no clouds in the sky at the time and no obstruction of our view. It was a dry night and no other terrestrial aircraft were in the sky. They simply vanished into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were observed by me and my partner. We are both professional people and parents, who do not drink or indulge in any recreational substances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are (were) both skeptics until now!<n>

I heard her exclaim something to the effect; &#34;FIREBALLS?! - What do mean Fireballs? - What, they&#39;re in the sky?!&#34;. She continued discussing it over the phone and then the call ended and she walked back into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short time later my (male relative) pulled up in his car and got out - and we began to talk about what he had seen. According to him - he was on the corner intersections of S. Main St., And Oxford State Road across from the Mcdonalds restaurant when he noticed people watching three objects in the dark night time sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He described the objects as &#34;little black balls with greenish white fire like jet exhaust that wrapped around each of them&#34; , and that the jet exhaust would &#34;blast out&#34; - and then &#34;suck right back into them&#34;. He said that he observed one of them drop from the formation of the three - nearly to ground level, and the rise right back up and return to formation (it did this only once according to him).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked him if he had gotten a cell phone picture of this - and he replied that he had, but it &#34;didn&#39;t turn out&#34; so he deleted it. He described the objects as large and bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He went into the house - and I remained on the porch, and a short time later my neighbors returned home across the street. There were two cars of people - and one was a car full of kids (assuming his kids and their friends / relatives?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> They got out of the car and were screaming about what THEY had seen as well. I yelled at them that my (male relative) had also just seen the very same thing - and I walked across the street to discuss it with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They showed me a cell phone picture of a formation of three identical, ethereal looking boomering shaped lights (not lights in a boomerang formation - but each light was shaped like a boomerang or more accurately a chevron - like a wide letter &#34;v&#34;. I asked them if they were green and they said &#34;No - they were more whitish looking&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They also revealed a detail that my (male relative) did not reveal, and that was that these objects were trailed by - or dropped from - a larger object or other objects behind them and just behind, or beneath the low cloud cover.These other - or this other object they described as three red lights in a &#34;smiley face&#34; type of configuration. They described it - and the other objects as being big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both they - and my (male relative) confirmed that the original objects were lost from sight when they eventually dropped to ground level. And - both parties relayed to me that the objects first initially appeared &#34;out of nowhere&#34; to begin with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Inquiries to the Middletown Police department should be made - as well as inquiries to discover other potential witnesses as well - as the objects were apparantly noticed by multiple parties in the area, and were quite obvious. Although I wish to remain anonymous - a graphic of the photo - and a map of the area will be submitted to you momentarily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous; provides minimal contact information.

Looking through the patio door of my appartment. I notice a big orange sphere above Quebec City.  At first, I thought that it might be a plane but I notice that the light doesn&#39;t move.  It began to move slowly to the east and finally disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not bother at first, thinking that it was a plane. But two minutes later, the same object showed up at a different place in the sky. The light emitted from the sphere was very, very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a very bright fire orb. It was also acting like fire (light intensity going high and low).<n> <n><n> <n><n> From this point, this had taken my curiosity. Being a UFO enthousiast myself, I needed to record evidence.  I&#39;ve seen exactly the same objects 2 times in my life, years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2 minutes later, my DSLR camera was set on the tripod in front of the patio door, ready to take long exposure pictures of the object. The lens used was a Canon 75-300mm at full zoom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From 21h45 to 23h45/midnight, sightings occured every 4 or 5 minutes.  I&#39;ve managed to take many pictures and even recorded a simple video of one of the objects with a point and shoot camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, 4 objects showed up at the same time, all were going in the same direction (east).  They disappeared with no  particular order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday July 18th - 21h50 to midnight Exactly the same thing as Friday 17th. Repeated sightings of the same objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Monday, I bought a VHS camera in order to record footage of the UFOs if they reappear one day. Unfortunately, nothing showed up since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not planes - Objects were stationary and they could move back and forth Not helicopters - I saw an helicopter passing by and it did not left the same trail as the UFOs. Plus, the helicopters had blinking lights and the helicopter didn&#39;t. The light was so bright, could not be an helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not fireflies : the objects could hide behind the Frontenac Castle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d also like to add that I posted this report on a car enthousiast message board and a guy saw the same thing from the north shore of the city at the same time.<n>

We were having a conversation when my sister said, “wow! What’s that up in the sky?” so my friends and I turned around and saw a flying object in the distance. It must have been about 3 or 4 miles away. But it was a very clear night with no clouds and you could se stars. But it was definitely not a star. What we say was a round, spinning object zipping throughout the sky.  It had neon coloring and the lights would switch colors. It started with neon blue, then it turned into neon green, then a bright white light and then it went dark. We were kind of confused and it lighted back up and was a deep red color. When it was the red color, it was flashing. It went out again and then it started doing the color cycle again. there was a ring around the object and thats where the lights were going around. in the middle, it was pitch black.It was then out of our point of view because of houses and some trees. We came home, and my sister looked out her window just to see if it would pop up again, and soon after it did come up and then it disappeared. That was the last of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we were coming home from the pool, we had some weird power outage types of things. The lights were going out on our street and when we got home, the lights in our living room were being kind of funky and were going on and off and like flickering. We did not have anymore problems after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My partner and I were seeing off friends in our back yard and while looking looking into the sky towards the south I noticed a slow moving bright orange object moving from the south-west towards true south .<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are located at Launceston, Tasmania and the object was initially travelling from south-west towards south-east and then seemed to turn right heading south and also climbing away.  My partner suggested it was an aircraft but I was sure it wasn’t as there were no red or green flashing navigation lights and I also believed it was not in a viable flight path area as it would have created a problem for normal Launceston airport air traffic . Launceston airport is south of the city of Launceston and the position of this object was at high altitude but seemingly directly above the airport .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object being at a high altitude was of only the size of a star but distinctly bright orange in color . There was scattered cloud and as the object climbed away the intensity of brightness began to vary until eventually we could not see it .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to say that I am an astronomy enthusiast and often gaze at the night sky whilst having a cigarette in our back yard and try to identify sky objects such as planets and various stars and sometimes see sattelites . I am certain I have not mistaken this object for a normal aircraft and while I would be thrilled at the prospect of proof of alien visitors buzzing around our world in spaceships , I would never generate a hoax or false claim of this nature . I was going to run inside to grab my digital camera but I realised that the object was going to be out of view within seconds and at best a photo would have only shown a faint , starlike object .<n> <n><n> <n><n> From Launceston , Tasmania<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Could not have been the ISS, which was visible from this location only during morning hours on July 17, 2009.

My friend has a house with a hilltop behind it.  Almost every night for a week we would go to the hill top to star watch.  On one of our first nights my friend, whom I traveled with and I witnessed two fast moving steady lights that seemed very very far up..much higher then any plane.  There was a local airport and planes went in and out of the area - but you could hear the engines and see their blinking lights - this was nothing like that - they were gliding silent and moving at a very fast rate very high up in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a succession of nights we had a camera with us and started out just taking pictures of us and then up at the night sky to capture the stars.  The first few nights we took pictures with the flash and got some strange objects.  Orb like orange and blue oval shapes and some other glowing objects - which at first seemed like we had maybe caught some &#39;alien objects&#39; and we were excited .. but then being the skeptic I dismissed as dust, beetles or dragon flies caught in the flash. Some if you zoom in clearly appear like they could be bugs..others ?? Not sure what they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any way, one of those nights when we where showing the pictures we had just taken to our friend who owns the home - we had gone back inside - and had our back to the window that faced the hill - but he was facing the window - He yelled and jumped up because he saw a bright beam of light come down behind the hill.  He&#39;s lived there for years and has seen plenty of shooting stars and meteor showers..this he said was nothing like that.  we were too scared to go out and look - though he wanted to.  We did searched around the next morning around the hill but saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the final night of our visit it  - was a clear night with lots of visible stars,  my friend and I had gone up to the hill and I said &#39;ok let me prove my bugs in flash theory - look I&#39;m going to take pictures with out the flash and show you that there really isn&#39;t anything out there..&#39;  So I took a series of pictures pointing up into the sky with out the flash.  Then I decided to run some video clips from camera again with out flash. I held the camera to the sky and let it run. Even though my eyes could see the stars the camera&#39;s screen really wasn&#39;t strong enough to pick up the light of the distant stars except for one very faintly. As the first clip was about to end and I was getting ready to leave the hill a very bright light zigged zagged up from the far bottom corner of my view - seemingly from nowhere. (I almost felt like the object knew I was leaving and wanted to &#39;show itself&#39;.) The clip ended so I started a second clip and held my camera on the bright object that ! was now very visible on my camera screen and seemed to just hang in the sky - it was a pulsating light.  I panned a little to the right because my eye caught other movement and a much brighter second light moving towards the first light and a third less bright and smaller light also came come into view. My friend had gone down the hill and was calling me to come down.  I was now up there alone and a little freaked - so when the clipped ended - I left the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aside from lots of orb like shots and the video clips we also captured on camera a strange white triangle object in the sky when we were taking a sunset picture.  We didn&#39;t see it with our eyes.  But it appears on the shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many of the friends we met who live there - say these lights in the sky are common events and I would have to believe it based on the week I spent there - you need only look up..<n>

It appeared to be at a very high altitude and was moving so quickly that I could only see it for perhaps 3-4 seconds before it disappeared into the dark horizon. I could not hear any sound coming from the object – it appeared to be totally silent. It flew in a straight line, heading north, and was moving far too quickly to be of human origin (in my experience).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was difficult to gauge the object’s size as altitude was impossible to ascertain. My guess is that it was very large. Colour appeared to be whitish, or perhaps it was emitting a dull white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shape was nothing like any UFO’s I’ve heard about. This one looked like about six standard shaped aircraft joined wing to wing (they were definitely connected - it was a single craft) and flying in a perfectly straight line at incredible speed. Never seen anything like it and cannot explain it. The impression I had was that it was simply flying past the planet on the way to somewhere else because the speed and altitude was so extreme. When it disappeared into the horizon, I had the impression it was long gone…  No one else witnessed this and no photographs (sadly).<n>

The object has three white lights in each angle, dim light in the center, and a blue light that phases in and out because of movement.  The object moves like a kite but varies in speed.  The object also rotates.  From the first time I saw it in the sky, it’s location of movement moved from above my neighbor’s house to my house.  I am trying to take pictures but my camera cannot zoom out that far and my camcorder video is poor. My neighbor and her son were out there too.  My neighbor asked if I thought it was a UFO but I told her what it was not. The object is neither a plane nor a helicopter.  If I had to guess how far it is from the ground, I would say about the distance of a helicopter flying in the sky.<n>

As it approached the Swan Mountain Range to the east of the Flathead Valley, MT it vanished.  I saw the object first and brought it to my roommate&#39;s attention.  He came out to see it for himself and we both saw it vanish.  Neither of us have ever seen an object like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Being an avid airplane fan I allways look up at the sound of an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the small plane fly overhead I saw a strange light due east of the plane about 10 miles, at an estimated altitude of 8000-10000ft. Intrigued I watched the light proceed west in the direction of the small plane. I assumed it was a commercial plane on approch to SEA-TAC international. So I continued to track it until it started to flicker behind the trees. So I waited to see if it would continue on it&#39;s flight path to the west. It did not reveal itself so I ran to the street for a better view, to find this bright orange light (once the size of a pinky nail, then the size of a small orb) within seconds it had accended to breaking the atmosphere to exit east of the original sighting. At that time, the light shot out some sort of trail ahead of it&#39;s direction to exit earths atmosphere. The best way to desciribe it, is a small meteor with a tail but it wasn&#39;t coming, it was going, then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole experience took place within a matter of seconds and I had no time to get a witness or a video recording. So I hope my testimony is enough to explain this very strange happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, being an avid fan of airplanes, means I know what type of aircraft are in the skies these days including possible (top secret) activity so I know exactly what I see in the sky 100 percent of the time... until now.<n>

It was moving north to south as was the first one I saw. It got brighter(very very bright) then it got smaller and dim before disappearing. It appeared to accelerate very quickly before it moved out of sight.  I was joking to my husband and said (Well guys is that all no more?) Then another appeared moving from the south to the north and again too far away to see the shape but close enough to see that it was not a plane ( no running lights) It moved up and one could clearly see it was accelerating before it disappeared out of sight.<n>

The sky was blue and clear.  Suddenly he heard a loud, high-pitched sound overhead, looked up and saw a clear but well-defined movement of air, circular, approximately 18 inches-24 inches in diameter.  It was darting rapidly from place to place among the tree branches, causing the branches and leaves to blow.  It was about the height of the roof of our two-story house.  After about a minute to and minute and a half it darted up and left.  The trees blocked his view of the actual direction it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other witness was our son who was talking on the cell phone to my husband.  He asked his dad, &#34;What’s that noise?  Did your alarm just go off?&#34;   It was so loud that it could be heard clearly at the other end of the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did an internet search to see if it could have been a weather phenomenon but have not come up with anything yet.<n>

About 15 degrees above the horizon a very noticeable deep reddish orange light with a diffuse haze around it approximately 3 times brighter than Venus (which was visible in the southeastern sky at the time)was moving slowly in a western direction. Motion was determined as this object was drifting slowly in relation to the rest of the star field nearby. Object was viewed for about 20 seconds then it slowly began to fade out over a time frame of about 5 seconds. The brightness, hue and motion of this object preclude it from being a satellite or meteor. Object could not have been an aircraft either, as 2 planes were seen in the area about a minute after the object disappeared and had a vastly different appearance than the unknown object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I dont want to make a big deal out of nothing but if there are other reports like this from washington i am willing to talk to anyone there who wants to listen thanks<n>

Many people thought I was making it up until they got to see it too! (yes, I ran and got them so I wasn&#39;t alone starring at it.) Tonight my parents finally witnessed it! I ran through the house and woke them up. I rarely look to the skies at night searching for strange lights or objects, but it seems that when I check out what I think is Sirius (the brightest star I can see from our crappy smog infested, light polluted skies here in SoCal.) late at night,  lately I have seen this object... I just happen to catch this Orange object sometimes when I look towards that star. It flies higher than a normal plane would, has NO blinking lights, it sometimes changes from Orange/Amber to Red-ish color then back to Orange/Amber, and then blacks out for a few seconds then lights back up. The third time I seen the thing, it was hovering and flying lower than the second time, it change from like a round bar shape... to a perfect circle, (It would help to mention that I ran into the house and grabbed the binoculars before hand, so I was lucky enough to watch it change shape.) The object (if it is the same one over and over again?) has no wings, makes no noise, and moves in different directions and sometimes hovers in one spot for a little while.  I was so glad my friend ran to my house to let me know it was back out in the sky, because THIS TIME I could grab my parents so they don&#39;t think I&#39;m nuts anymore. I know this won&#39;t be the last I see of it, because it&#39;s been 4 times already in less than 6 months and I&#39;m not searching for it every night... There has to be someone else out there besides us who have seen this thing... especially over Huntington Beach area where it seems to fly over sometimes. Once, it dropped/emitted 2 bright blue-ish white objects from under it that fell straight towards the ocean water, yes, it had to be over the water, it was far far out there. I was NOT the only person to witness that, and we both were like, did you see that!? What ! did it s hoot out?! It seemed like it shot out the bright objects because they looked like they went downwards faster than a falling object. It was fast... We were on my roof at that moment trying to get a better look at it through binoculars.  No noise... this thing was quiet as can be and when it would pick up speed, still no noise. I&#39;m not saying aliens, but it&#39;s for sure not a satellite because it moves in different directs and hovers, it&#39;s not a plane, it hovers and has NO blinking lights and no sound for the speed it goes, not a helicopter, flies way to high and fast with yet again, no noise..., not a balloon, not a chinese lantern, and not a blimp, NO WAY, I&#39;m familiar with all of those.  If you don&#39;t believe me, I suggest if you live around my area of Orange County,CA., you check the night skies from around 11:00pm &#39;till 1:00am every now and then, your bound to see it if my neighbors and I have already seen it four times, and two out of the four were just this month alone. From now on, I&#39;m going to check every night around 12:00-1:00am... I wish someone could tell me what we keep seeing. At least I&#39;m not the nut who seen a UFO now, now my neighbors are right with me on this one! ...relief, but still very curious as to what I have seen more than once. Next time I&#39;ll be ready with my Video camera attached to my binoculars. (it works!) I&#39;m not joking or making any of this up, I wouldn&#39;t even write this out, but I&#39;m hoping to get some answers or at least someone else who seen it too...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We came into the tent around midnight or 12:30 and my brother pointed out the light in the sky and said that light was here last time we came in the tent (which had been about 2 hours earlier).  So we layed down in the tent and watched the light for over an hour and a half, and during that time the light seemed like it just hovered way up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it make distingtive shapes in the sky but no matter what shape it made or direction it flew it always went back to the same spot in the sky.  Later on while still watching it we turned on a lantern in the tent and the only light visible in the sky was the one we had been watching.  And eventully the light would get dim then bright and it did that for a little while.  We looked away for a minute and when we looked back up it was gone.<n>

The saucers appeared to be about 100 feet long, and 20-30 feet wide. They seemed to be of a grayish teal color, but the darkness made the color hard to decipher. There were window-like squares surrounding the saucers on every side, that resembled windows. On the bottom of each saucer, 3 large circles, resembling spotlights casted beams of light onto the meadow below. They hovered in the sky, considerably low to the ground, for about 4 to 5 minutes, while slowly but continuously spinning, before they disappeared over the horizon while casting a blinding white flash across the sky as they left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Original date above is flawed.

I am familiar with hundreds of aircraft and hold multiple ratings at different locations around the world. I am telling you this because when I say that the objects that 5 different people saw were not anything the FAA is familiar with, I know what Im talking about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife, Brother in law, and his wife and I were attempting to do some night fishing and found ourselves having no luck for several hours. Which was odd being that the lake had just recently been stocked for an upcomming tournament.  We finally had enough and headed back towards the bay area to dock for the night and had just reached the mouth of it when I noticed the first of the three fireballs rising up froma site about 1 kilometer from shore.  My brother in law was the next to notice the odd light and alerted my wife and then his wife.  We set the boat into idle and watched as the second and then the third rose from the shore line to join the others.  The sat in a straight line approximately 300 feet apart at about 1500 feet Altitude.  About 30 seconds passed by and then the two farthest to our right joined the lead fireball and sat for a brief moment and flew off at such a high rate of speed that it took a few moments for mind to process that hadnt just disappeared.  The three of us to awestruck to actually say much of anything about it restarted the boat and headed back to dock for the night.  The next morning my mother in law mentioned that she had seen the three orbs as well.  I was not assigned to a Air Traffic Control facility in the area and had no reason to report the sighting at the time, although I have discussed it with other Air Traffic Controllers and while they think I am crazy they admit they have nver seen anything like that as well.  While searching youtube one day a coworker brought to my attenti! on a video taken in Hawaii that was exactly what we saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should mention before closing this report that my wife did attempt to capture a video of the fireballs on a HD camera phone but the video was horrible.  It looked like the old tube television sets when you placed a magnet to close to the edges. It wasnt worth keeping so we deleted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am just now reporting it because of the video we found on Youtube being identical in every way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

I was coming outside of my house to tell my sister she had to come inside, since it was getting late. When I walked toward her out of my front door, she asked “What is that light flying in the air”? As my sister, her friend, and I watched this light is started to move in a zigzag line. I told my sister to try to record it on video on her cell phone. As she started recording I ran inside the house to grab my mother’s video camera. When I ran out side the orange light had not moved much. As I tried to get a good shot of it on the camera, it kept moving. I then zoomed in on the object and it looked like it had markings on it. As I pressed the record button the orange glowing light disappeared.

There is very little light pollution in this small town in the woods and the sky was clear.  A couple of nights ago about 11pm I saw a bright white flash, three or four times the intensity of a bright star.  It was 5 or 10 degrees from directly overhead.  I continued to watch the sky and saw another flash several seconds later in a different spot.  I extrapolated to the south to where I thought it would be for the next flash and neither the time nor the trajectory stayed the same.  The last flash was to the southwest of the second flash.  It took longer and did not travel as far across the sky.  I thought maybe I was seeing shooting stars coming right at me.  I had never seen that before, but maybe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tonight I saw the same white intense flash but only once.  This one was maybe 30 degrees from overhead to the south.  Then a second later, not in the same spot but in the same vicinity, I clearly saw a faint gray sharp rectangular pattern.  It was about 1 inch by 1/4 inch at arms length.  It had about 5 or 6 parallel lines running the long way inside of the rectangle and seemed to appear and disappear just that fast.  The rectangle lasted longer than the flashes but less than a second.  The long sides seemed to be well defined but the short sides were a little fuzzy.  Maybe the parallel lines just ended evenly and the length to width ratio gave the appearance of a rectangle.  I can’t say the rectangle appeared to be a craft but it was bizarre.  Neither the flashes nor the rectangle are anything I have seen before.<n>

I was outside working on my car and he called as he was on his way to work and told me to look up in the sky.  As I looked up, I saw a red-orange sphere hovering above my house. It was lower than any plane.  Living near Boeing, I witness a lot of planes flying over head.  I thought it might have been a stealth fighter jet at first, but then it just hovered and moved slowly south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside and told my parents to come out and look.  We all stood on the porch and watched the red-orange sphere move south.  It began to ascend into the sky and the light from the craft became smaller and smaller.  It went high into the air until it wasnt visible anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too dark to get photos on our phones and it was only in the sky for a short time.  I waited around to see if it would come back for about an hour, but no luck.  I was very skeptical of UFO sightings until I just witnessed this craft in the sky.  I have never witnessed anything like it and it was a very eerie feeling.<n>

Although I&#39;m unsure of the exact day, I do know this is the exact month because I was driving to Tullahoma, Tennessee to pick up my aunt for a late viewing of the Ice Age 3 movie at the local theater.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on I-24W toward Nashville; I took exit 111 into Manchester to drive onto Tullahoma.  After one exits 111, to get to this destination, there is another left, then straight drive into Tullahoma.  Right after I made the left turn, I saw a hovering pyramid above the treetops. I didn&#39;t have a camera, nor a cell phone that would&#39;ve taken a good enough picture, but I am an artist and I made sure to get a good look at the flying object so that I could draw it later on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a three-sided pyramid.  It was a metallic, shiny black color.  On the first side I saw, there were 10 circular white lights, stacked in rows (4, 3, 2, 1).  The best way I can describe these lights is to compare them to the lights that overlook a baseball game.  On the next side, I looked back to see three small lights near its top, each different colors- red, green, and blue.  I was topping a hill when I first saw it and after crossing it, I could see underneath the craft; it was hollow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was hovering just above the treetops, I&#39;d say about six to eight feet above the leaves.  On the opposite side of the median/road, cars were pulling over.  On my side of the road, all of us were slamming our brakes and two cars ahead of me, there was nearly a wreck.  This was proof to me that I wasn&#39;t the only one witnessing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was about 20ft wide and was a proportional triangle on each side, so perhaps about 20ft tall as well.  As I&#39;ve said, the craft was hollow. I will provide an illustration as I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

By my estimation the light seemed to be only slightly above tree level.  I moved in the direction of the light hoping to capture its image on my cell phone; despite attempting twice I was unable to capture any definite image on the phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light remained in one definite place for a period of approximately 20-30 seconds, appearing still in the night sky above the houses.  The orange light within seemed to remain constant, appearing to slightly pulse to the naked eye.  After remaining still for a 20-30 second period the light began to in the direction I guessed to be northeast.  I lost sight of it several times when it was blocked by trees and each time I saw the light it appeared smaller.  The light maintained a constant appearance, seeming to move slowly while I&#39;m convinced it must have been moving with some definite speed.  I ran, attempting to mark the movement of the light, hoping to identify exactly what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By 21:25 I had lost sight of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/15/09 21:00|Charlotte|NC|Circle|60 seconds|Strange balls of light in the sky|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/085/S85627.html|300|ndxe200907| Strange balls of light in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular incident, me and my sister were outside on my balcony in South Charlotte, NC.  I happened to be telling her that she should observe what goes on in the sky at night.  The skies were clear and we could see the stars very well.  I have on two other occasions, in Virginia Beach, have witnessed an incident of a ball of light that I could not explain what it was.  While staring over the night sky, I noticed a light, that was, it seemed to me was trying to disguise itself as a star.  It was like at first glance it looked like a star but after staring at it, I could tell that it was not outside of this atmosphere.  Then it started to move.  It moved horizontally thru the sky, It was completely silent.  It was far away.  We lived in an area that was in a busy flight/landing path of the Charlotte Douglas Airport. There was not a flashing light on this object as airplanes have.  As it moved, it was on a horizontal glide and trailing it was a faint t! rial of light.  It definately was not exhauaust from a plane that will linger after the plane passes.  This light was like a smear behind this object that was flying.  There was no &#39;exhaust&#39; trail left behind. The further it traveled across the sky, the dimmer the light was.  I have seen many shooting stars and meteor showers and cannot compare this object to what I saw.  I know that it was not ordinary because my sister was becoming uncomfortable looking at it. This object was not a sudden fade like a shooting star...This was a calculated, dimming of the light that I had witnessed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The very first time I had seen something like this was at my home in Virginia Beach, VA...Right near the Chesapeake border.  I have always liked looking up at the stars and one day I stepped out of my house to smoke a cigarette and while waiting for my sister to come outside, I looked straight up.  That is when I saw a star that was very bright but it has a dull yellowish tint to the light....it was not pure white light like a star...but it looked like a star.  I stared at this object for about a minute and then it started to move. First a slow sway back and forth then it started raising it&#39;s elevation.  Even though it did not look like the size was shrinking siginficantly I could tell that the swaying was moving away from me.  For about 30 seconds, this object swayed back and forth like a metronome and as it swayed the ligth gradually got fainter and fainter until it was completely gone.  There was no noise and I know that this object was not a plane or a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, also in Virginia at the same home, I went outside on the porch again to smoke a cigarette.  This time it was right about when the sun was going down.  The sun would set behind my home and it was down far enough that the only thing that was lit was the sky.  The shadows from the house and trees were at their max &#39;stretch&#39;.  I looked over to my right at the sky.  Some stars were already visible.  I saw this one star that was unusually bright that I know was not the North Star.  It just seemed like it was out of place. We lived in this home for almost 30 years and I had never noticed a star that bright in that area of the sky at that time of the day before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While staring at this object after about two minutes, I noticed that it was moving...back and forth...It was almost like it moved becuase I wouldn&#39;t stop staring at it.  The way that it moved back and forth, made me feel like it was staring at me too.  There was no noise and this light was a perfect sphere.  It ! didn&#39;t twinkle like other stars.  As it moved back and forth, I could clearly see that it was raising its elevation and that same trail of light was following it. The higher it climbed, the dimmer it got, still bouncing back and forth until it completely disappeared.  That took about a minute or two from the time that it started moving for it to fade completely out and when the light was completely gone, there was nothing that made me think it was a plane or chopper or any other man-made vehicle.  It is disturbing that I have had three incidents that I have seen an object flying in the sky that I could not identify.  I am originally from Virginia Beach and this is a highly active military area w/ airforce bases and naval bases nearby.  I am not a stranger to seeling military planes and have also seen a stealth bomber fly by...  These objects were not planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully this information will be helpful to you in your research.  One thing that resignated with me from watching programs about UFO&#39;s is that if there is a race of anything in outer space that has the capability to make it to our planet, how so far we are behind in their technology as we cannot get a human past the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/15/09 14:23|Monkton (Canada)|ON|Light|At least 1 hour|I saw an unidentified flying object in the sky that looked like a star with a ring around it and it moved too quickly to be from earth.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71102.html|301|ndxe200907| I saw an unidentified flying object in the sky that looked like a star with a ring around it and it moved too quickly to be from earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at least 2:23 AM when I glanced out my window before I was going to sleep. I looked at the stars, but one of them looked strange to me, so I stared at it. At first it was a white-yellow cream color, but it flashed greed, red, and blue as I watched. I thought that maybe it was a plane, until the object which was the shape of a star with a ring around it moved straight up and down and side to side in a matter of seconds. The best way that I can describe how fluent the movement&#39;s were is like dropping something in water and pushing it back up again. There was no sound, but as I watched it disappeared and reappeared in a matter of one second, almost like I&#39;d blinked. There was only one of them, and there was a white aura type shading around it. The object emitted lights and it looked like someone was signaling someone else with a multi colored flash light. My sight was dulled a bit as I watched it, and I could hear a high pitched ringing the next day when I woke up in the morning. I don&#39;t know when the object was gone, because I was trying not to think of it, and I fell asleep. The sky was very clear that night. I do not need glasses, so aside from the weariness due to staring at the bright object, my sight and hearing were not impaired.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My upper body was at a 45 degree angle.  When I went to turn the page I briefly looked up and saw an object pulling a very large vapor trail behind it.  The only reason I started to watch the object was because the object seemed to be traveling faster than a jet would at such a high altitude.  I know that means nothing unless I knew the exact altitude.  But, that’s not my story..as it moved north it passed in front of the sun so I put my hand up to protect my eyes and waited for it to emerge from the other side of the sun.  It never reappeared.  Then, I looked back at the vapor trail and it was gone.  I watched a vapor trail today  ,07/17/09, that was in approximately the same spot at the same time and it just floated away in the upper atmosphere wind. It didn’t vaporized, just floated away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whereas the one I saw the day before just vanished within maybe a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this is not very exciting but thought I would report it in case you are trying to accumulate sightings to use as fodder at some future congressional hearing.<n>

It was about i&#39;d say, the size of a beetle car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> later, when me and my friend investigated in the woods, we found 3 huge branches from nearby trees were somehow cut and fell exactly into the shape of a triangle.

There was a large, bright half-moon that was very high in the sky (~80 degrees of azimuth) to the Southeast; several bright stars were visible although most were obscured by scattered high-level cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather:  Generally clear skies with very light clouds between 20,000-30,000 feet and a second layer of scattered clouds higher up (~50,000-60,000 feet).  There was no significant wind at ground level but the scattered clouds above were moving briskly towards the southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other Aircraft Visible:  A large commercial jetliner (737,757, 767 scale) was visible at a bearing of about 120 degrees true at an estimated 35,000-45,000 feet in elevation.  The aircraft’s structure and contrails were visible to the eye as were the white strobe warning light and red &amp; green running lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers Background:  I am a retired Navy Commander who served in the Navy for 21 years on both submarines and surface combatants.  I have been involved in both nuclear power and nuclear weapons and maintained security clearances above the TOP SECRET level.  My most senior assignments were at Fleet Forces Command (U.S. Atlantic Fleet HQ) NAVSUPSYSCOM as Director of Supply Chain Management for all Navy and Marine Corps conventional ammunition. My educational background is in chemical, mechanical and petroleum engineering and I hold a Masters in Business Administration.  Currently I work as General Manager for an industrial manufacturing company.  I have excellent vision, am taking no medications, have never had delusions or mental illness and am not a stereotypical &#34;UFO fanatic.&#34;  I have a significant knowledge regarding aircraft available in the current military inventory and have observed aircraft exceeding mock 1 in relatively close proximity.  I have observed a night-time launch of the space shuttle when my submarine was in Port Canaveral, FL.  I have not observed a definitive UFO or made a UFO sighting report previously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sequence of Events:  Initial Observation:  I existed my front door at exactly 5:30 AM to start a typical 5-mile walk.  I always check my watch to verify my start time.  It was still fairly dark outside with only a faint hint of sunrise on the extreme eastern horizon.  I immediately noticed a very bright group of lights to the southeast at approximately 140-degrees true and about 10-degrees above the tree- line.  These lights caught my attention because I had never seen anything like them before as they were extremely bright.  To my naked eye, they appeared as three glowing balls that were close together or perhaps touching.  At first I though I must be seeing the moon through clouds but as I glanced up I could see a very bright half-moon well above and to the left of the object.  I also noticed several stars were out and that there was a large commercial jet at about 100-degrees true and very high up (~35,000-40,000 feet) that was traveling east-to-west.  As I glanced back at the three lights I observed that they had traveled a significant distance in just a few seconds and seemed to be moving at great speed.  I couldn’t see any typical aircraft lights (white strobe or red/green running lights) and had a gut feeling that this was an unusual event.  I bolted into my house to get a pair of binoculars.  This initial observation took 5-7 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second Observation:  I had a pair of 10 power binoculars readily available for an upcoming hunting trip and it took me no more than 10 seconds to retrieve them and return to my front porch.  I relocated the object in the sky at about 190- degrees true, about 15 seconds after first seeing the object.  Obviously it had moved from the southeast horizon to southwest very quickly.  I observed that it was about 25,000 feet in altitude … about the same height as a few light clouds that were close by the object.  I also estimated it was 2-3 miles to the south from me horizontally.  As soon as I looked at the object in 10-power, it was clear there were 6 distinct bright lights.  I looked hard for any visible structures (wings, fuselage, etc.) but saw nothing, nor could I see any typical aircraft lights (white strobe or red/green running lights).  The lights were circular and arranged in a symmetrical pattern of a circle or an imaginary hexagon with each light being centered over each of the corners (see diagram).  The lights were all the same size and color (white &amp; yellow) and were moving together.  It could have been six objects moving in formation but my impression was that the lights were located on a single object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not seeing any distinguishing features, I put down the binoculars as I wanted to try to gage the size of the object using any available reference.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, it had been about 20 seconds since I first saw the object.  It had continued moving west and was at about 220-degrees true and still at ~25,000 feet.  I quickly estimated it had traveled about 10 miles in 20 seconds.  This computed to 30 miles per minute or 1,800 MPH.  Clearly it was moving at 2-3 times the speed of sound and confirmed my impression of extremely high velocity (I had directly observed military aircraft at supersonic speeds below 500 feet in elevation in the past … the military can do this on the open ocean just not over populated land).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then compared the object to the half-moon still to the southeast and above the object.  In comparison, the object would have covered 25% of a complete FULL MOON in size (see diagram).  It also equaled the half- moon in brightness when seen with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also remembered the large commercial jetliner to the southeast and thought to compare size with this as well.  The jetliner was still plodding along at 500MPH or so and had moved about 10 degrees to 130-degrees true.  I could see the jet’s structure clearly and estimated that the diameter of the object with 6-lights was approximately 2.5-3 jet-lengths or 250-300 yards across--obviously very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a thought that perhaps I was seeing the international space station or Hubble telescope and that I was catching a reflection off of solar collection panels as sunrise hit one of these orbiting structures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Final observation:  I had been observing the object for about a total of 30-35 seconds at this point when the object came to a rapid stop, or at least stopped moving west.  I then looked through the binoculars again and picked up the 6 distinct lights in view.  After 2-3 seconds all 6 lights rotated about 30- degrees to the left, like a door knob that was being turned.  The object then began to climb vertically--it was no longer moving west, just up, straight up.  I also observed that there were definitely clouds above the object telling me that it was not in fact in orbit around the Earth but in fact in our atmosphere and between cloud layers.  It appeared the object was accelerating quickly, as within 4-5 seconds it looked to have shrunk to less than half it’s original size.  Within another 3-4 seconds I observed it breaking through the upper cloud layer and it immediately shrank from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Comments:  The total observation period was about 50 seconds with a 10-second break while I retrieved the binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not hear any sound from the object (like a sonic boom) but I also did not hear the commercial jet when it passed overhead about 2 minutes later.  One possible explanation is that higher level winds were moving briskly to the southeast and taking acoustic energy away from me.  Also, there was a loud freight train about a mile away that was generating a significant volume of low frequency rumbling masking noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was definitely moving at a high rate of speed, appeared to be substantially larger than man-made aircraft and was maneuvering.  It moved from the eastern horizon to the western horizon in about 25 seconds and then straight up and out of site within another 10-15 seconds.  Initially, it was somewhat below the commercial jet (also moving west) but the object was moving much faster.  It took the jet 2-2.5 minutes to traverse the same distance that the object traversed in ~25 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The brightness of the 6-lights was so intense that it was impossible to see structural details beyond the glare.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was definitely between cloud layers and not in orbit around the Earth.<n>

I shot footage off and on for about 2 hours until it was light outside witch made it hard to see, then all the sudden I heard a roar in the sky to the south, as I looked That direction I seen what apeared to be a fighter jet with the afterburners on heading straight At it. It looked like the sphere started moveing north away from it as the fighter got close to it It went straight up over the top of the fighter jet and then apeared to back the other direction,  The fighter tryed to turn at that moment but couldn&#39;t turn that sharp and over shot the ufo so far  Because of the speed by the time it came back around the ufo was gone it just shot straght up in Sky until it was out of sight.  I did my best to zoom in and out on the ufo to get objects in the Footage to give some way to judge distance like trees and telephone poles I would like to show this Video along with a few others I have showed to friends that are very amazed at shots I have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would just like someone that has the ability to examine the footage I have and tell me if its A ufo or if there is a normal explanation for what I seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Then the object then turned 180 degrees towards the North West and began scanning the mountain top with a shapeable bright white search beam. The mountain top is estimated to be about 4 ½ - 5 ½ miles away from my home.  The object was moving very quickly compared to conventional aircraft and was completely silent.  Normally I can hear helicopters from that distance very clearly as the sound echoes of the canyon and mountain surface. The object had to be moving or jumping from mountain peak to mountain peak in less than a seconds. It did not appear to be in a hurry but searched quickly and lit up ¼ mile sections of the mountain top almost as bright as day with its search beam.  I could very clearly see the rocky surface and trees present on the mountain surface. I watched it move from place to place along the south side of the mountain top and ridge as if it were searching for something. It probably covered about a 1 – 1 ½ mile area east to west then seemed to go north again just over the mountain crest out of view.  The strange thing is that when it went out of view it appeared that its search beam was penetrating the mountain with a blue hue as if it were translucent or the beam were actually shining through the mountain as it searched both the north and south sides. Because of this translucent appearance through the top area of the mountain crest it was very difficult to gauge if the object was behind or in front of the north side of the ridge. Very strange indeed, because the object was not visible when it went over the ridge but the beam was. Just when I thought I was wrong and that it just had its search light pointed away ! to the n orth it ascended upwards over the ridge to the south side again and the translucent looking beam spot looked as if it came up over the top surface of the north crest and then down the south side again only to get brighter and whiter. I then immediately began feeling my pockets for my cell phone to take a picture and remembered that I had a flip camera in the house.  I started to walk backwards quickly and then the object stopped dead in its search, I had a feeling like you get when in the back-country and you spot a deer and realize the deer has spotted you too. The object then pointed its search beam down the mountain slope in my direction but the beam only ended about halfway down the entire mountain ridge. I had a feeling that it knew I was aware of it now and quickly walked backwards towards the door while keeping an eye on it. It then resumed search of the area with its search beam as I dashed in the house to wake my parents and get my camera to film the event.  I woke my parents, grabbed the flip camera and ushered my parents outside to whiteness the event (about 30seconds). When we got outside it was nowhere to be seen and I stayed outside for the next hour long after my parents retired back to bed in hopes it would return so I could film it. It never returned.  The whole event only lasted about 2-3 minutes. I have seen strange unidentified objects when I was younger but nothing like this that was so bizarre and so visually active that lasted more than 45 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Forest.  That night around the fire, I was star gazing when I saw a shape flying form one side of the sky to the other.  It had bright blue and red lights, that blinked slowly and irregularly.  It started flying in a straight line, but suddenly seemed to gracefully and quickly drop down, then fluidly backed up.  It then continued straight in it&#39;s new path.  I quickly shouted for my husband to look up.  He watched with me as the shape repeated the same maneuver, before continuing in a line out of  sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are professionals in our forties that do not drink or otherwise imbibe.

This campsite is appoximately 8k feet in elevation with no cell phone reception nor many lights. It was around 23:00 hours and we were looking up at the sky and how clear it was. I saw a white star like object pass slowly across the sky and pointed it out to him, saying it was a satellite, as I have observed satellites in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat for approximately 10 more minutes looking up at the sky, as we observed 2 more satellites pass by during this time. Each one moved across the sky at a steady rate of speed in a continuous, uninterrupted direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute or so later, we observed another star like object. This object moved as the other satellites previously had, at a steady speed and direction. Yet about 2/3 of the way across the sky, the object made a 45 degree sharp turn, continuing at the same rate of speed it had been moving at, but now headed in a southern direction. We both witnessed this and both of us turned to each other in astonishment.<n>

My partner noticed it first, hovering above the Wellfleet Marketplace store and commented, &#34;Isn&#39;t that a flying saucer?&#34;.  As we stood entirely still in near disbelief, I answered &#34;Yes, it is.&#34;   It was fairly close above the rooftop (about 40 to 50 ft. off the ground), and approx. the size of a VW bug. We were across the street about 50 feet away.  The saucer had a  metalic flat-grey surface. An oval cylindracle,  shape (about 4-5 ft.) protruded from the top center of the saucer-like craft. It appeared viscous glass-like, and very thick.  I saw gray shadows underneath in motion but couldn&#39;t make out any figures exactly.  The glass cylinder was covered with a dark, thick, metal crosshatch design, with about 3 or 4 strips (about 6 inches wide) going in each direction.  Out of this glass cylinder was a straight up beam of strong white light, similar to a search light, but much, much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then disappeared into the night sky going in a horizontal direction, south towards the Wellfleet Harbor. It zoomed off, hovering even and straight and at an extremely rapid speed, silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have worked in the airline industry for years from Alaska to the Antarctic and many places in between. I have never seen anything even remotely similar. It definately wasn&#39;t a fixed wing aircraft nor weather recording equipment/device.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We don&#39;t drink alcohol, nor take any illegal substances.  And we aren&#39;t religious or new age types of people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was that we witnessed that night we believe was not from this planet and remains a mystery to us.  I looked in the newspaper and listened to radio/tv news and didn&#39;t hear of anything unusual reported, the following day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ever since that event I can&#39;t look towards the sky the same. I really am mystified.<n>

The door has a full length glass pane in it with a sheer curtain over it.  I could clearly see a brightly lighted object in the sky as it was dark enough outside by then.  I could not tell the shape, but it appeared to me to be a straight wing with no fuselage, though it feasibly could have been a frisbee shape on its side with no curve, and about 8 or so bright flashing colored lights straight across it.  They were red, blue and I think white and orange and/or green.  I thought it was a jet plane about to crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very startled because I don&#39;t live in a flight path so my mind was really befuddled by this time trying to make sense of what I was seeing.  The position of the object was very close and low and slowly passing just beyond a 2-story apartment building about 100 yards beyond my building in the same complex of about 10 buildings.  I did not see from which direction it came, but it could have possibly passed right over me before I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure of the altitude, maybe that of a roughly 30-story building.  To me, it appeared as though it was slowly going into a landing pattern where the wheels come down and touchdown is imminent.  If I extended my arm it would be about the length and width of my pinkie finger framed between two buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up and got on my slides so I could step outside to get a better look.  By the time I got out on the patio the object seemed to hesitate for a fraction of a second; I thought it was trying to pull the nose up because at this point my mind still thought it was a plane, however, there was no engine noise and I assumed the engine had been cut off.  It then veered slightly to the right and disappeared behind a building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for an explosion or flames and smoke shooting in the air, but nothing like that happened.  In fact, it was just gone and I heard nothing about it on the news afterwards.<n>

The light appeared be have flashing blue, red, and whit lights and failed to move quickly. It slowly moved. I called two co-workers and asked them to observe the sighting and to give me an opinion of what they believed it was. They saw it and confirmed my sighting. We looked to see if perhaps it was the shuttle endeavor, but that didn&#39;t launch as of yet!  Clueless as to what the green shooting star was, and the lighted object!

As I was looking up, I saw a kind of bright flash of light start to go through the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it started to look like a shooting star, but then I realized it couldn’t be because it was very large in size and it flew underneath the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The atmosphere of this situation was a very dark muggy night.  The sky was completely covered with clouds, except for a few wholes where u could see a few stars.  It was a yellow tinted light. Pretty large in size. It flew underneath where the clouds are and then it just kind of vanished suddenly.<n>

It took about a minute to get from where I first saw it on the right of the sky, to the left, where it slowly faded (which took about 10 seconds) then disappeared. It was a very clear night with no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It couldn&#39;t have been a plane because it was moving so fast, plus it was too bright to be a plane, and it wasn&#39;t flashing either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it could be a satellite but it looked too low (unless it was in very low orbit?) and too bright (I see satellites all the time and they&#39;re not very bright at all).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thought it could be a meteor (or shooting star) but they only last for a couple seconds, this lasted for about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as it got to the other side of the sky it slowly faded then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From where I live in Exmouth you can see planes flying past towards the airport in Exeter, and from a certain angle you can&#39;t see the flashing lights on the planes, so at first I thought it could be that. But it was WAY too high to be a plane, and much too bright, and it went from one side of the sky to another so I would have seen the flashing lights if it was a plane. Also, planes don&#39;t move this fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read a lot and watch a lot of programs on tv about this kind of stuff but I really can&#39;t explain this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did have a camcorder with me so I could have got it on tape, but unfortunately I had no tapes on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station flew over Woodbury at 00:28 hrs. on this date.

I looked to the South sky to see a very bright light at about a 7-10 degree elevation. My parents were both asking me what it was, and asking if I saw any blue or red lights on the object (there weren’t from what I could see). As we were watching the object, it disappeared into thin air, and didn’t come back for as long as we were out there.	 The object was about twice the size of an average star, and was also about twice as bright. There was still sun on the horizon, and we couldn’t see any other stars at that time anyway. The object was completely stationary throughout the entire period.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is a rough guess but I would say it&#39;s height was somewhere between 2000 and 5000 feet.  I first thought it must be a plane as we are in the flight path of a major airport.  Started looking for wings, couldn&#39;t see any but that&#39;s not really unusual because sometimes the angle of the plane makes it impossible to see the wings.  Then I realized that the &#34;plane&#34; or &#34;object&#34; was in the wrong place for the flight pattern - too high for just taking off or landing, and too low for passing through. No contrail at all.  As I watched the object, which was flying east to west at about 65 degrees above the horizon, it appeared to just simply fade out. I was looking right at it (still looking for the wings on the thing don&#39;t ya know) as it slowly dissappeared! The effect was like a plane going behind clouds that are thin at the edges but get thicker towards the middle - I&#39;d say about 8 to 10 seconds from the time it started to fade, to completely gone. But there were no clouds in the sky. I don&#39;t know if my eyes were playing tricks, but at the last place I saw the object - the spot where it completely vanished - there appeared a faint dark smudge - like smoke - in an otherwise clear blue sky. It dissapated in a few seconds, making me wonder if I had actually seen the smudge. I continued scanning the sky but saw nothing more.<n>

We watched for a few minutes in amazment because it was so high up in the sky and moved so fast. We then called my aunt and it was still flying all over the place then we saw i plane fly towards it and the weird object started following it in a straight line and just as fast.  It finally stopped and went backwards but slower this time.  It floated around some more then it almost seemed like it flipped sides and looked like a regular star in the sky and dropped and it was out of vision.  My aunt and i stood outside for about ten minutes after that but we saw nothing.  I have to say i have never believed in ufos and never in my life thought something would come to earth and ive even had arguments with my boyfriend over the subject but this was something i just couldnt explain and it was amazing.

The area of my home is Risley Derbyshire, I continued to watch the object for a good 10 minutes, I did get my camera to take a shot but unfortunately I could not get it set up properly to take a picture I continued to survey the object and all of a sudden it took off at rapid speed although I am not quite sure what it was I am sure it was not a plane or a helicopter as I see these every day being near a airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is something I have not witnessed before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I am not certain if what I saw were really UFO&#39;s or just planes but planes are very doubtful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on my porch at 1 AM. (I live off of East Dorothy Lane). I was having a cigarettes and I saw some sort of flying object. It seemed to be diamond shaped. I couldn&#39;t actually make out the object itself. It has 4 lights. 2 lights were white. Another was green. And another was red. The green and red lights were blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew over and made a noise smiliar to a plane. In this area, there are quite a few planes but the planes are always slightly lower to the ground. This one was much higher up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After disregarding this one as just the usual plane, a few more appeared and they were up higher. They didn&#39;t seem to be moving at all. I went back out later and they were still there. They were so far up that it was hard to make them out. They could have been easily dismissed as stars if you didn&#39;t look hard enough. Faintly, I could see the blinking red and green lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been seeing these aircrafts for the last couple nights now and would like some sort of feedback.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Too fast to be a plane, also the lights on the object were like nothing I&#39;ve seen before on any aircraft.  The object was slightly disk-like, but more substantial.  I would say more oval-shaped than anything.  The lights moved in a horizontal line across the object in a dotty pattern and changed colors from pinkish-red to light green to white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a short time it was very close but it moved further away, still in our sights but not as clear.  As it moved, the first thing that occurred to me that was odd about the flying object was the sound.  It was completely silent except for when it was closer at first, but even then it didn&#39;t sound like any kind of engine at all.  All we heard was a soft whirring wind noise.  Also, its movements were eerie and very strange.  Not like anything I&#39;ve ever seen or heard of before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it moved further away, it stopped traveling and started hovering in place.  The lights continued to revolve around itself in that dotty pattern and the only movement it made was a slow swinging from side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were really weirded out and this point.  We kept trying to verbally convince ourselves that it was a plane or something of that nature, but it was becoming more and more obvious that it wasn&#39;t a plane at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we both saw the object vanish into thin air without warning.  But almost a second later it reappeared in a new place directly to the left of its original spot.  We watched it do this several more times, disappearing and reappearing in new locations that were all relatively close together.  Its movements appeared very erratic, but effortless and swift at the same time.  Then the object started traveling towards us.  My friend and I were just staring at it, freaked out.  It looked like it was coming straight for us.  The object was rapidly growing larger in size as it closed the distance between us.  It was then that I noticed more things about the object.  There seemed to be a pinkish-purple haze surrounding it.  Also, the object didn&#39;t look remotely metallic or industrial.  It merely looked like an extremely dense concentration of energy in that oval-disky shape with the lights continuing to revolve around it.  I can&#39;t say for sure that the object even looked solid.  It was definitely substantial, but it looked to have formed out of a material that I couldn&#39;t begin to fathom, even now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped midair and remained completely still for a long ten seconds.  At this time I could clearly make out its shape and the light patterns and color changes.  Then it shot directly over our heads to the left and traveled an insane measure of distance in about half of a second.  I wish I had a better sense of distance so I could be more accurate about this...  Anyway, at this time both my friend and I were convinced that this was something not of this world.  The movement was like no manmade aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.  The movement was precise and liquid and smooth when it traveled that fast.  Also, there was no sound.  A plane, number one: could not have gone that fast, and number two: would have made a very loud noise when it was that close to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then hovered in the left section of the sky, repeated the same swinging movements from before.  It was slowly moving further away.  My friend and I watched it for a little while longer until it disappeared from sight for good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say,  I really regret not having a decent camera function on my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Been watching it for 2 weeks now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I have noticed a bright white light in the southeastern sky almost every night for the past 2 weeks.  It is low in the sky.  From my second story bedroom it appears just above the tree line.  The trees are about 20-25 feet off the ground.  Not every single night but probably 60-70% of the time.  It appears around 11pm-12pm and appears as a bright light.  At first, I thought it was a bright star but as we studied it, it appears to wobble, move up and down and side to side.  I am a very novice star watcher but I am not aware of a bright star in the low southeastern sky.  This all happens as it hangs in the sky basically in the same location for long periods of time – hours.  I watched it until 3am a few times before going to sleep. I started watching it again last night.  I picked a land based reference point and watched its movement across the sky. Over a 45 minute period it moved very slowly across and higher in the sky appearing to stop along the way and continuing to wobble. The movement was very subtle but it is definitely moving – miles – very noticeable distances over the 45 minutes.  I can’t estimate the distance because it is so far away.  I have been thinking it is a star but based on my limited experience, stars don’t track across the sky this fast (based on the Earth’s rotation) It is not like watching a constellation like Orion or anything like that.  Also, it appears much closer than a star.  It is above the cloud deck but appears to be well within the atmosphere. My wife thinks it’s a satellite but again, based on my experience; it seems much closer and again does not move like the satellites I have observed crossing the night sky.  It appears in almost the exact same spot every night we see it.  Not sure what it is but it definitely is something we have not seen before.  We have been living in this location for almost 8 years now and I have been observing the sky out my bedroom windows at night for years now.  It’s something that I have never seen before.  We ar! e colleg e educated professional people and its bizarre enough that I felt I needed to notify you.  If you have any type of explanation for this I would love to hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving very fast as we both looked on but it changed direction and seemed to stop in the distance. It then moved slowly to the left and then came towards us at a high rate of speed and changed direction again and disappeared behind the roof of the house next door. We moved back to try and find the light again but it seemed to be gone. I have seen strange lights before but they had always turned out to be a plane or some kind of aircraft. But this was way too fast and an odd shape. It was pretty high up but I can&#39;t figure out what it was. I was very excited and still am and I will probably be up half the night to see if I can spot it again<n>

I waited to hear a sound because if it was a man made craft it surely would have crashed.  I heard nothing - saw nothing after losing sight of it behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too large and too bright to be a falling star and from where I was I would say it was half the size of a full moon high in the night sky.

After searching UFO witness reports I found similar instances and decided to add mine to the list.<n>

It was moving from North to South, and at the time I assumed it was a meteorite!  However; I looked for stories of it hitting Earth, but never seen any. With the size of this thing, it would have had to been seen or felt somewhere if it indeed hit Earth.  So it was something else for sure!  Over this same summer, I also saw “Star” like lights in the sky that moved quickly from one place to another.

The light coming off was a solid deep-orange, but also pulsated. The object was coming in our direction maintaining its height, and stopped almost seemingly noticing it was being watched. The objects color disappeared and a solid black sphere could be seen. The sphere moved back and forth a bit, slowly, and began to faintly light orange. Then the object stayed the black color, and traveled the opposite direction from which it came, seemingly flying lower as it traveled off. I also tried to take a video of the object but my cell phone would not pick it up!<n>

After just hearing about the &#34;Phoenix Lights&#34; on March 13th 1997, my father and myself recall sitting outside one clear summer night in 2009 maybe around 9:30 (Your ZULU time or Military time confuses me a little bit, so might as well be sure on this.)  We saw only one oval shaped Amber colored... object, in lack of a better word, about 4-5 miles west of where we were.  It had sat in one spot for a minute or two, then we noticed it was slowly moving around, and from where we were sitting it was almost not even noticeable.  Then, it disappeared for about two minutes, slowly fading into the night sky.  All of a sudden it slowly reappears, and does literally the same exact movement we saw.  It was almost like a deja vu moment.  After a few more minutes it had disappeared again, and that was the last we saw of it. Oddly enough  (This really doesn&#39;t matter, but my father and I had found it rather amusing since what we had seen prior to walking into the house.) the! film &#34;Contact&#34; was on our television.  I hope you do not find this report a &#34;fake&#34; or a &#34;joke&#34;, due to it being as real as anything we have seen or felt or even heard today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you want to do an interview my email is here: ((e-address deleted))  If you decide to read this, I do hope to hear back from someone, maybe someone from Minnesota, preferably in town, but oh well if not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for taking this time to read this. - ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/12/09 20:45|Oceanside|CA|Unknown||Not a plane. Not a helicopter. Red and blue lights that vanish and come back within a second|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71062.html|342|ndxe200907| Not a plane. Not a helicopter. Red and blue lights that vanish and come back within a second<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 8:45 at night. The sky was still slightly blue so it was not completely dark. I was sitting at the top of my stairs at my apartment. (Let me just say a week and a half ago I saw the same thing around 4 in the morning, I told my mom about what I say but she did not believe me. It was a very bright light, white bright light and had a small red light above it moving around, it was be there than vanish than come back.) Anyways back to last night. So I saw something moving in the sky when I looked up. The way it was turning was so quickly and smoothly that there was no way it could be a plane or a helicopter. It made no sound at all. It had 2 blue lights and one red light. I screamed for my mom and she came running out of her room to where I was, I looked up at the object, oh yeah and I couldn&#39;t make out the shape because the lights were too bright and it was still a little too dark, anyways, my mom got over there and at this point it was just flying straight and looked pretty normal. My mom was like you called me out here to look at a plane in the sky. I didn&#39;t say anything and we both kept staring at it. All of the sudden it started moving up and down like it would drop 100 feet and than go back up again way to smoothly and easily to be anything like a helicopter or plane, it was turn very quickly also, like it&#39;d be going in one direction and in a split second it&#39;d be going the opposite way. Me and my mom were speechless. I looked at her and asked her to explain what that could possibly be and she just laughed. She did not have any idea what that could possibly be. She started nervously laughing. We watched it for another 5 minutes and it started flying away towards the west and all of sudden it completely vanished. About 2 seconds later it showed up in a completely different part of the sky. So it vanished and than popped up on the opposite side of where it vanished. IMPOSSIBLE thing for a plane or helicopter to do. My mom looked at me and was like how in the world could it d! o that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed out there for about 10 minutes watching this thing vanish and come back and do turns and smooth flips making no sounds. Than one of our neighbors came out who lives below me. He looked up and me and my mom staring into the sky and was like what are you guys looking at. We didn&#39;t say anything so he looked up in the direction we were looking at. He was like Oh a plane. The object was again flying straight so looked kinda normal. Than it started doing those 180 turns and going up and down the guy stared at it and pulled out his camera phone and was freaking out. He tried to take a picture but of course it didn&#39;t come out good. Being a cell phone camera. I can&#39;t even take picture of a full moon on my camera phone. Anyways. It started getting far away and vanished behind trees. The guy ran out into the parking lot on the phone telling his friends what he saw looking for it. My mom still didn&#39;t know what to say, and I went inside to call friend and tell her. I came back out and my mom was still staring in the sky, I looked up and the object was gone but now smaller lights that were further away began to pop up in the sky. They were sparkly to the point where they looked like they were on fire. Again with red and blue lights around them. I don&#39;t know what this was. It was DEFINITELY not a plane or helicopter or jet or anything like that because those can&#39;t vanish and pop back into the sky or morph around like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/12/09 04:00|Tulsa|OK|Fireball|30|UFO sighting in the eastern night sky over very populated area.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71047.html|346|ndxe200907| UFO sighting in the eastern night sky over very populated area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few nights ago I was in my front lawn around between 2am and 4am smoking. I was gazing into the sky and saw what looked like a very bright star. I knew it could not be a star because it was so close and the color of the sun. I went online to see if there were suppose to be any visible planets that night, which it said there was so I figured it was a planet. Last night July 12 2009 at 4am I was outside again and saw the same star object in the same place so I assumed again it was a planet in the eastern sky. What caught my attention this time as I was gazing at the planet/star it was moving. I was startled and confused to what I was seeing. It was the same object as I saw before a few weeks ago round bright orange and kind and a lower point to it but not exactly sure, but this time i saw it kind of swaying back and forth. This time I knew what I was seeing was not a planet or star and was not a helicopter because it was way to big to be one. My step dad was here asleep and I decided to wake him thinking maybe he should take a look at this. I woke him and had him follow me outside to show him what I was seeing and it was gone! I told myself planets do not disappear in five minutes and they do not sway back and forth. The night was a clear night, no sign of clouds and this sighting was over a highly populated city. Now that I have seen this object twice I am going to set up a video camera and hopefully will get the chance to get this object on camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I will be honest, I had a couple to drink, but two of the other three were sober. I was staring into the west night sky when I saw a very dark shape with two lights in the front section, which were solid spots, and two whitish, almost rope light lights on the tail this thing flew completely silent. I sat up and said &#34;holy sh!t a UFO!!&#34; my cousins turned around and looked into the sky, as they saw it, we all stood up and were hysterical over the occurance. My cousins and I all saw the same thing, and it seemed like it was a triangle shape. As I was watching it fly from the SW to the NE, I attempted to take a picture with my phone. I looked at the phone to find out the screen was black. I watched it fly over a line of trees and disappear from my sight, and my cousins turned toward me and each other and asked &#34;where did it go?&#34; I told them it went behind the trees, so we moved about 20 feet to be able to see it again, but it was to no avail. Now today as I write this, I have a strange pattern of red circles on my back that I do not know whether or not are related to the sighting, but the circles are about half inch in diameter, and are extremely consistent and in almost a waffle iron pattern. They are not raised and there is no irritation on my skin. I had my wife take a picture of them so I can relay them to my friend in the NSA one day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

When my friend noticed a twinkling star that looked a little out of place. It had seem to be moving in sporadic movements. then it had started moving across the sky in a zig-zag pattern and started blinking. Then on the other side of the sky we had saw another object just like it and they moved towards each other. Then when they had met they started to circle around each other and things had started breaking off of it in all directions. Then both of them had slowly dissipated into the sky. And a few moments later an object that had seem to be &#34;invisible&#34; but still noticeable had 3 lights and was HUGE and moved across the sky and disappeared into the lights emitting off of shops and other things in the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were diffuse balls of light zooming at very high speeds in circle formations that would intersect making the overall pattern look like zig zags or figure eights. Also some of these orbs were popping in and out of my view in patterns of movements that were in shorter duration and appeared to me as not moving in circles. However I had the thought that these orbs were further away from me and I was only seeing on end of their trajectory or path. When I would shift my focus to the whole sky rather than trying to follow a couple of the orbs I then noticed that there were many more balls of light zipping all over the sky. I had the thought that they were flying at various altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night was a beautiful night with a light cloud cover, patches of clear sky and stars peeking through. All day the clouds over the Bay were unusual, multi-colored, and diverse formations, several rainbows appeared in the late afternoon, early evening. A summer thunderstorm was trying to express itself. A few drops fell. It felt like a Hawaii day and night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the orbs last night I wondered if they were absorbing energy from the clouds. The phenomenon stopped when the cloud cover dispersed and the moon rose into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I wondered if the lights were searchlights.  I did not see any beams however.  I only saw the balls zipping and circling about. They were not the lights from normal aircraft. I wondered if they were being projected from a ship/boat but as the lights were above my head and my house in on a hill half a mile from the edge of the Bay, it did not seem possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a UFO buff. So I am not sure of the correct vernacular to use to describe what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have done an internet search wondering if anyone else saw what I saw.  But I have found nothing thus far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights?  PD))<n>

The weather was warm and clear. The moon was 3/4 full with Jupiter off to it&#39;s right. Three of the four moons of Jupiter were visible. My friend&#39;s house lies under the flight path for planes going into Seatac when they have to fly south to circle around to land going north. It&#39;s also under a flight path for planes that are going to Boeing Field from the south.  Needless to say, we see a lot of planes on any given night that we stargaze. We also usually see one of the Guardian helicopters from the King County Sheriff&#39;s Department flying around, so we are both very familiar with the aircraft in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1:00am when Coast to Coast took a commercial break, my friend went into his house to use the bathroom. A few minutes later I decided to stand up to stretch my legs. We sit on his porch facing due East, so when I stood up, that&#39;s the direction I was facing. I saw a bright pulsing light directly ahead of me. My first thought was that it was a private plane with it&#39;s landing lights on heading in my direction. Private planes&#39; landing light pulse on and off as they come in for a landing, but the color was wrong and I couldn&#39;t detect any forward motion. The color of the light was sort of amber yet at the same time it was like a mixture of red and white light, but not pink. As if the red and white light was swirled together. I could detect both colors at the same time although it appeared as one light. The motion that I could detect was a gentle back and forth motion and at the same time a gentle up and down motion. It was erratic yet seemed under control. I grabbed my binoculars, Celestron Skymaster 15x70s, and looked at it. It appeared much closer, but otherwise appeared exactly the same. I was pretty sure that this wasn&#39;t a plane, so I flashed a small flashlight at it. I didn&#39;t notice any reaction from the object. I then grabbed my friends big flashlight which I believe is a 2.5 million candle power light. I flashed it twice in the direction of the object. I&#39;m not sure if it was coincidence or not, but the object moved slightly to the right behind a tree. I had to move to my left a few feet to be able to see it again through the tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 30 seconds the object started moving to the left. When it did this I could see that the pulsing light was a white light at the rear of the object, based on direction of travel. There was a non pulsing white light at the front of the object and there were 3 non pulsing red lights visible. As the object came out from behind the tree moving North, I flashed the big flashlight at it a couple of more times. Again, I don&#39;t know if it was coincidence or not, but the object accelerated. It was a very quick yet smooth acceleration. This is when I realized that the object was not as far away as I had first thought. I had been thinking that it appeared to be very far away, but now it appeared as if it was only a few thousand feet away, perhaps closer. Without knowing the size of the object it&#39;s hard to tell at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object moved what appeared to be North, I would lose sight of it for a few seconds as it went behind trees, but I quickly realized that it was now heading West, or perhaps WNW towards Tukwilla. It accelerated again, very smoothly, and I lost sight of it when it went behind a neighboring house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked at it with the binoculars as it was traveling westerly, I was looking at it from the side, so I could not tell what shape it was, but I got the impression it was triangular. I saw no wings and no tail section and it was totally silent. From it&#39;s apparent size and distance, I should have easily heard it. Guardian One at that distance would have been very loud and easily identifiable as we have seen it on many occasions fly by at that apparent altitude and distance.  The only problem is that whatever this was, was way faster than Guarding One and made no noise.  As a matter of fact, Guardian One just flew over my apartment as I am writing this. It was quite noisy and can be heard a great distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was also much too fast for a private plane, which we had fly over us not very long before this sighting.  Again, the private plane was easily heard and identified.  For it to have been a commercial plane, which we see several every night, including tonight, the pilot would have had to have been making an emergency landing since he was only flying about 20 degrees off of the horizon.  At the estimated distance a a few thousand feet, it would have been incredibly loud.  I also estimate that it was only a few hundred feet in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel like I&#39;m rambling, so I&#39;m going to end this.<n>

It was not close, not too far either-15,000/ 20,000 feet??  It was dead silent.  I could not see any craft; just this very precise cloud structure slowly creeping across the sky- therefore assumed it was a meteorological phenomenon.  The shape just seemed too geometric to be natural.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were getting out of the car when I noticed this Orange object to the west.  It was about 10:00pm.  My nephew and I saw this orange star like object silently come from the west.  It moved over the Salt Lake valley. It was at about 4,000 feet off the ground. At first it was moving fairly fast and slow down.  It was slowing turning northward as it traveled. At times it almost stopped as it moved more northward. Once it was over the northern part of Salt Lake City it just disappeared.  We also viewed it with 2 pair of 10x50 Bushnell Binoculars. My Sony Handy Cam would not record it, but I could record some stars that were not even as bright as this object. Perhaps the orange color is not as recordable?  At 11:15pm we seen a UFO over down town S.L.C.. My nephew and I first viewed them with 10x50 binoculars. Also the next door neighbor joined us too, but became so scared she hurried back inside her home. The big Craft hovered for about an hour with 4 other orange , white and multicolored lights moving about also winking out totally at times. We viewed these objects with 10x50 binoculars and with my telescope. I put a high power lens in the telescope and the picture attached is what it kind of looked like. With that 6mm eye piece I can see the rings of Saturn with it, even on a poor visibility night…… so we got a great view of it! It was awesome!<n>

It was circle and bright. It swerved and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I were outside talking on my back porch, and i was facing a sliding glassdoor when a very bright light reflected off of it very fast.  It was &#34;like&#34; a car pulled in to my backyard, and the cars brights reflected off of the glass, but i live out in the woods a car can&#39;t get to my backyard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the light reflected off of the glass i looked at the sky, and saw a very bright circle moving very fast.  It was a little bigger than the size of a dime coin compared to the stars. It was moving in a straight line.  Then it swerved into a circle like a double u-turn, and disappeared completely.  I could tell it was flying in the sky, and not in space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it for about four seconds from the time it reflected off my glassdoor to the time it disappeared. It didn&#39;t make any noise, and it didn&#39;t leave any kind of trail.  It was no doubt a UFO from out of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend also saw the whole thing, and when it was over we were speechless.  We didn&#39;t know how to comprehend what just happened.  After about 20 seconds of holding eachother after it happened, still looking at the sky, my exact words were, &#34;what the fuck was that!&#34;  I don&#39;t remember if she said anything back to me.  We went inside, and didn&#39;t go back outside for the rest of the night. We didn&#39;t really talk to eachother for the rest of the night either. Just writing this has been giving me the chills, and it was over three years ago that it happened.<n>

They were above the clouds;  no sound;  no strobe lights like aircraft would have.  Moved from southwest to northeast over Eau Claire although on slightly different trajectories.  They each moved at a fairly fast, and constant, rate of speed and were out of view in about 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One witness says he has seen lights like this before over Eau Claire several times in the last 15 years.  The other witness has never seen lights like these before. One witness ran for binoculars.  Through binoculars lights just looked like bright lights;  no further detail could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unusually bright areas of lightning followed the sightings in the west, northwest, and north within 15 minutes.  Then clouds moved in and there was a mild thunderstorm with mild rain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers were out in the yard with pets when lights were seen.  Both observers are former Air Force members, in medical professions, not flight professions.  They live in an area with lots of overflight of aircraft and these lights are not consistent with any typical overflying aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

When we got out of the car my 5 year old asked if a bright light up in the sky was a planet.  It was a clear night so myself, my daughter and wife began to look up into the sky to star gaze.  I looked at the light again and realized that it had nearly moved behind a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not blink so it could not have been a commercial airliner.  It stayed a yellow/white and was clearly very very high up in the air.  It moved due North very fast.  There were other commercial aircraft in the sky that night flying due south and north west.  At first it was travelling the speed of a commercial aircraft, but it picked up speed quickly and began to travel 5-6 times the speed of a commercial aircraft very quickly. It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light approached the horizon we looked up and saw another light moving in the same tragectory.  It was nearly exactly the same in all ways including speed.  I watched until each light had traveled over the horizon and was out of sight.  The entire event did not take any more than 4-5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed at which they accelerated was amazing, and I have been unable to stop thinking about it since.  My daughter and wife witnessed this as well.  I am convinced that it was not a satalite or asteroid/shooting star and was some sort of aircraft.  I am unsure if it was in the atmosphere or outside of it.  They were not satelites.  The most likely scenario is some sort of high flying supersonic aircraft.  The lack of any noise was the most shocking thing about the whole incident...until I saw the second light following the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can you find out if the military had any aircraft flying north at supersonic speed along the NY/VT border that night?  If they did not then I would call it a UFO just due to the speed, brightness of the light, consistancy of the light, and exact trajectory of each object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of ISS.

We saw a very large triangle shaped UFO. we were driving down a dirt raod, and saw a bright flashing light. we were in the middle of nowhere, when driving down a dirt road, when we saw a flashing light.  we had seen objects here before, and our intentions were to look for ufo&#39;s, this is a hot spot. people who live in this area have been chased in there cars, seen objects on a regular basis. It was 10:30pm, we went off road behind some mountains, no sooner had we come around the moutain, we saw the large flashing light. All of us were scared, but at the same time curious. my friends girlfriend was crying and telling us to turn around. we got withing 2 to 300 yards from the light. It was the size of 3 football fields. it was triangle in shape, and windows around it. it was about 3 stories tall, and about 30 feet offf the ground. we flashed our lights and it flashed back, in the same sequence of flashes. my friend James and I gout out and walked closer. the closer we got, the better we could make out what was standing in the windows. there were small big headed aliens, and then 7-to 9foot tall aliens. we based this off the size of the windows. some of the windows you could see through, the other windows were dark, but then the dark windows, cleared up one by one, and as they went clear more and more aliens appeared through the windows. James was video taping the whole time. it was a sureal expierience. i was terrified, but excited at the same time! we walked closer and had to stop because the heat coming from the craft was so intense. the craft hovered and then landed. a large pannel at the bottom of the craft opened, and then two aliens proceeded to walk out. this absolutely terrified us more, but we couldn&#39;t move or talk. i remember trying to scream, and say run, but we couldn&#39;t move, or talk. Heather and Jamie were in the car honking the horn screming to come back, but we couldn&#39;t respond or move. the a! liens wa lked up to within 20 feet of us. one of them was very thin and tall, bout 8-9 feet, the other one was about 3-4 feet. we stood there in amazement, shock because we couldn&#39;t move or speak. Then a calmness came over us they were speaking to us telepathically. they were saying not to be scared they weren&#39;t going to harm us. i remember asking why they were here in my head, and they heard what i was thinking. this conversation went on between the 4 of us for 15-20 minutes. they said they were here to help us, so that we would not destroy our planet, and that there was a horrible event coming soon, that it had to be stopped. james asked if it was something like 911, they commented no bigger, and it would come from the middle east. I was thinking to myself like I had been in this situation before, and the tall alien heard my thoughts, and repeated my name. he said yes henry you have been visited like this before, and he told me. when you were 6 in deming new mexico, you were in the desert exploring, and we talked to you then. I had blocked this out, but it all came back.  they said they new we were coming, and wanted us to warn people of global warming and what was to come if we didn&#39;t start taking care of our planet. visions of disaster entered our head, as if to show us what was to come, if we didn&#39;t warn people. the taller alien walked closer, and held my hand, and I was no longer scared, neither was James. He said that he would see him again soon, and to warn people about saving aour planet, to both James and I. James was recording the whole time. they turned returned to the craft, and it was gone in a split second. when the craft left, we both fell over like weak, stood up and made our way back to the car. when we got there Heather and Jamie weren&#39;t crying anymore, they just hugged us. when we got in the car, it wouldn&#39;t start. so we sat there for a minute, and then it just turned on, by its self. like if things couldn&#39;t have gotten any wierder. as we started to drive away, three military helicopters apper! eaed, an d were shining light on us. then  5 military hummers showed up, and a chased us. I told James to hide the camera, Jamie and heather started crying. LUke airforce base is about 10 miles away from where were at. I tried running, but over a speaker they told us to pull over or they would be foreced to shoot at us. we pulled over, and military soldiers surrounded the car. Two men dressed in black, opened the door, and asked us to get out. One of them looked like I had seen him before. He asked us to get out and both men in black questioned us, while the military personell searched the car. the men in black asked us what we saw, how long we were there, what we were doing there, if we had any contact with the alien craft. the size, shape, what we saw, if they communicated with us. we answered no to everything, and then one of the soldiers found the video camera. The men in black reviewed it, and said we were not to speak of this. they took the camera, and took me with them. James, heather, and jamie asked where they were taking me, and they said don&#39;t worry about it. I left with them and they questioned me in the car. I kept looking at the one man dressed in black because i had seen him before. He asked why i kept starring at him, and said do i look familiar, scared I said no. they questioned me more, on what they said to me, and if I had ever seen or expirenced this before. I said no, and the at the I-10 highway, by the tonopah joes resturant, they let me out and then they were gone. i called James on his cell phone and they picked me up. it was a crazy night, but i had to report this. if anything happens to me James, will contaact someone, at your facility. our evidence is gone, but this really happened. we questioned people who lived in the area this morning, and they all saw the craft, and all the military soon after. this morning while questioning people who lived in the area, they all said that the military helicopters were flying over early in the direction from where they saw the craft. we drove down t! he I-10 to where we turned off of and there were military soldier who had the road blocked off, and helicopter flying to and from that area, so we aren&#39;t crazy, and there are 4 of us who wittnessed this, along with the people who live in the area who saw the craft. we talked to 15 people who lived in the area and all, but one saw the craft, the other one an old lady said she was asleep, but was woken up by the mititary heleicopters, and they have been going back and forth since midnight last night. I hope my story opens peoples eyes, and they see we are not alone, and the aliens are just trying to help us save our planet, and live peacefully. We are going back again tonight, but taking a different road, I will keep you updated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

In the northeastern part of the sky there was a circular object which seemed to be flashing many lights that were red, white, blue and green in color. The object started low in the sky and rose as time passed by.  After further sky watching we were able to see to more of these objects flashing the same type of lights.  All three if the objects rose in the sky and seemed to get farther away as time passed by. We watched the objects for a couple of hours travel farther from us. The next night my cousin once again checked the sky to see if the objects would appear again and all three objects were again visible the next night. We are unsure of what these lights could be and can&#39;t find many answers with online research thus far.<n>

Lights were there and then gone without a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

She told me it was the moon when I questioned her about them.  There are three pictures, one with a craft in the background, one with colored lines running down to earth with one looking like a rope, another with colored lines.  Each one of the pictures you can see the moon in the bottom of the picture.  The lines are coming from a ball of light that looks a little like an egg.  The craft can be seen in all three pictures. I am just not sure what I am seeing. I am forwarding all of these pictures.<n>

The light was higher than ive ever seen,it was a very distinct and sharp circular looking light.  I followed it with my eyes for about 2 minutes, it was moving very fast right up with the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It travelled accross the sky up by the stars in a straight line for a minute, it then went over my head so i had to lean back vertically to see it and follow it, it then started flying downwards then turned in the complete oposite direction, it went out of my view about a minute later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a noise in the bushes right next to me straight afterwards and got a horrible feeling of fear down my neck and back so i ran inside and locked the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know whether the movement in the bush was an alien being as it could have well been an animal like a cat or a hedghog but i was so scared i didnt dare look at the bushes for longer than a split second. This is the second time i have seen something unexplainable in the last 6 months, the last time i recorded a triangle shaped craft with lights in the corners just up by beamsley beacon, the reason i mention this is because the Menwith Listening station in harrogate is relitavly close to addingham and may have been something to do with it. The more i see this type of thing the more scared i feel about whats going in our universe and wether we really are safe on this planet.<n>

I have already spent time trying to find other witnesses or reports, but came up short. Basically, this had to be one of the most incredible UFO sightings in recent time..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 12 and it was during summer break.  I spent it at my grandma&#39;s house in Highland. I had a friend, Ryan, who lived across the street.  I spent the night at his house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around midnight (exact time, date and month unknown) me and Ryan were laying on his front lawn looking up, staring at the beautiful sky, talking about random topics.  Suddenly, and silently, a triangular shaped craft came into view.  A pretty damn big craft.  Our estimate was that it was several times the size of a 747.  It was relatively close to the ground.  It had to have been black because we saw no outline. We were able to see it was triangular in shape because it had many lights underneath.  I describe it as dim, smokey orange, green and yellow lights, with one big white one in the middle. We stood up shouting and screaming in fear and amazement.  Sometime during the event, I told him to go find a camera or video camera.  The craft suddenly shot a beam of white light to the earth (next to the highway on the! area of dead grass) and then retracted.  Then a few seconds later it shown a light seemingly through the top of it into the clouds.  I was watching it as it continued to fly off. My friend returned with his mom and no camera.  I think the craft was already gone because I remember his mom did not get a chance to see it.  We then noticed his neighbor working in his garage, but it seemed he didnt see the craft, and must not have been there during the event.  It was truely incredible.  I wish I had video or photo footage.  I&#39;ve been fascinated and a believer ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ALL I WANT IS SOME KIND OF CONFORMATION THAT THIS EVENT TOOK PLACE.  I WANT TO TALK TO OTHER WITNESSES!!  I cant be the only one who saw it!!!!!!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/9/09 23:50|San  Jose|CA|Circle|20 minutes|I saw a bright, moving, red light in the sky.|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71597.html|383|ndxe200907| I saw a bright, moving, red light in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking out from a friend’s house to go home at 23:50 PM on Sunday, July 9th when i looked down the street and saw a red light. It was a bright light in the sky, far away in the distance. It looked like a star, but it was red, and far brighter than any star I have ever seen (besides the sun). It was too bright and did not move like a plane or helicopter, too slow to be a satellite or a shooting star.  Similarly, the red light’s movement was erratic thus eliminating any-other known celestial body following a constant orbital path.  It was just above the trees down the street, in the southwestern sky. I called back to my friend, who was walking back inside, to come look at the light. We watched the light for approximately 20 minutes. Over the course of the 20 minutes the light grew fainter and fainter.  It went higher into the sky for about ten minutes, then started moving further south for about five minutes. It moved very slowly. It moved like it was ! the first stroke of writing a &#34;Y,&#34; going up (from the base of the &#34;Y&#34;), and to the left.  After about 10 minutes I called another friend with my cell phone and told him to go outside and look at the light. He saw it too. After watching the light for fifteen minutes, it stopped moving. It was dimming faster than it was before. It would flicker, get slightly dimmer, then brighten again. Every time it flickered it would become slightly less bright. Then when it became as dim as the stars around it, it started flashing and falling towards the earth. It moved faster than it did when it was moving in the previous 20 minutes. It appeared to be in a free-fall. It fell for about 30 seconds then stopped flashing and we couldn’t see it anymore. I could still see it for about 3 seconds after the light went out. I could see the object similarly to the way you can still see brightness from dimming embers.  Then we lost track of it and didn’t see it again.<n>

So I said to my friend do you see how that &#34;UFO&#34; is just stuck hovering above the power plant. At that time he said yes. the the object started moving towards or direction, slow at first then increased speed as it neared. then at that time I stepped of my porch and looked above as it passed the object &#34;UFO&#34; had six lights the front there were yellow and one light was red the the two after that were also yellow. the lights were in a straight line, and behind the object &#34;UFO&#34; were a sequence/series yellow strips of what seemed to be beams. The Object &#34;UFO&#34;  was a straight craft like a cylinder shape. then the Object Just increased speed once again and then seem to just disappear to no were in three night sky. Then my cell phone was cutting on and off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be twice the size of a star with the light fading in and out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as it slowly moved in a circular motion and went in all directions, and appeared to travel great distances in a short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a second object appeared within a minute of the first.  Both were identical in shape, movement and flying patterns.  They looked as if they were dancing about, playing with and chasing one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed both objects for approximately 12 minutes before they went straight over us to the north and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They returned into our vision a minute later and continued flying at alternating speeds with lights fading and brightening every few seconds.  The objects did this 4-5 times before we lost track of them completely.  We were able to view both objects for a total of about 18 minutes.<n>

I figured it was a satellite, but it was huge, easily 3/4 of a centimeter in diameter, and BRIGHT, we watched it move in a straight line east for almost a minute then everything changed it started accelerating for another 10-20 seconds then it briefly stopped, for just a moment, maybe half second then it headed east again. But now it wasn&#39;t moving in a straight line it was boosting; kind of swerving but every time it made a movement not eastward it was really fast. It was also kind of pulsing or breathing the; light never got darker, just brighter then back to normal. By this time it had moved from kind of over head/off my right temple at 2 o&#39;clock; to 3/4 maybe less of the sky towards the horizon. At that point it was about to become obstructed by trees so i jumped on my bike and went as fast as i could to get a better view. i got to a clearing in the trees on my street and there it was still moving east i watched for another 5 seconds before a more white/blue, like a clean white color (as apposed to the color of the rest of it which was more of a white/yellow) beam came from the center of it, the beam was 1 1/2 centimeters long and from where i was almost paper thin looking like a millimeter in width, it continued east still swerving with the beam for another 10-15 seconds it was almost to the horizon and i lost it in some trees. whole sighting lasted between 2-3 minutes. Most amazing thing i have ever seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the ISS.  PD))<n>

I told my friend to turn around because he was driving, and we went back to where we saw it and it was gone. We searched the sky for about 5 minutes and we didnt see it.

In this case it should be very very easy to confirm the same sighting, because a formation of 50-100 objects in such a shape is very very unique. On the local web sites, news papers etc.  I found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On youtube some videos: &#34;Lots of UFOs in Vienna on July 9.&#34;   But those are single points or maybe 2 points moving in the sky.

Since what I saw was so unique, not only a few moving dots in the sky, I am motivated to continue investigating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. Visibility of the formation from my position to the west is unlikely, because it UK/London it is at 9:00pm local time too bright. And the objects have been too small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. Hot Air-Baloons? A German specialist from CNAP told me: that these objects where just those chinese burning baloons. (definitively not because -<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. Asked at the ZAMG (Central Station for Meteorology and Geological Dynamic in Vienna) about wind direction and speed on 7/9/09 22:00. It was 9m/s in 1200feet, direction from 270Deg (WESTWIND) (Baloons, Paragliders etc. do not fly against the wind)<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5. US-Army Jet Fleet from Iraq to UK. Very unlikely that 100 Jets, in 60.000 feet (where they do not make much noise).<n> <n><n> <n><n> PENDING: I am checking, at which elevation at 22:00 local time Geographic position 48N 16E, the sun is still visible. I beleive, since the stars where visible, it should be above 50km (150.000feet). In that case, 100% NO for Jet transfer. They travel max. at 25.000m<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6. I expanded the trak of the observation now to the EAST. (286 Deg was the heading).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7. The track crosses exactly the Black Sea, north of Turkey.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8. My colleague in Istanbul told me, that he got in tough on June 15. with lot of People of the UFO-Conference in Istanbul (Erik v. Daeniken, ... and many others)<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9. My colleague will forward the immage I reconstructed to those people. He said, that since Jun 15. they observed a massive amount of objects above the black sea! Same as in 1999, where a large earthquake killed 60.000 People in North or Turkey. (official numbers are 20.000).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10. 1999 and July 22. Solar Eclipse causes with very high likelyhood heavy earthquakes. This is in relation with UFO observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Final line:<n> <n><n> <n><n> In case I will get any confirmation of this unique observation, I will let you know.  It could be the largest amount of UFOs observation in a single case ever. Worth to continue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have attached a reconstruction how the sky looked like.

In my photos I found a blue spot just to the east of the moon. My photos were not very good so the spot only showed up when I tried to enhance the photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have chased UFOs in the past, and found them ether undetermined or something neat. One UFO I chased was on a cloudy night. I was travelling from Shelburn Ontario Canada to Mount Forest Ontario by the back roads when I spotted these coloured lights in the sky. They were fuzzy and dull and looked as if they were moving. I decided to see how close I could get to the lights and I started to follow them. After several miles of following the lights in the sky I could see a cell tower through the trees. The cell towers lights were the same colour as the lights in the sky. When I got to the base of the cell tower I could see that the lights in the sky were the lights from the cell tower reflecting off the clouds in the sky. The clouds were moving and it was the moving clouds that made the lights look like they were moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any way has anyone been photographing the Moon lately? If you have did you spot the blue light east of the Moon? There was a bright star to the east of the Moon and the blue light was between the star and the Moon. The blue light was not visible to the naked eye it was only when I tried to enhance the photos it showed up on all of them. I spotted it on July 9 2009 at approximately 3:00 am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the person might have photographed Jupiter, which is near the Moon, currently.  PD))<n>

7/8/09 23:00|Camdenton|MO|Sphere|1 to 2 minutes|Large Red Glowing Spherical Object Moving Slowly About 150 Foot Above Ground Right in Front of Me|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71092.html|398|ndxe200907| Large Red Glowing Spherical Object Moving Slowly About 150 Foot Above Ground Right in Front of Me<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking a motorcycle trip along Route 66 and I was riding my motorcycle to a fellow coworkers cabin on Lake of the Ozarks Missouri to stay the night off the Route.  I got the directions wrong to his cabin and was heading West on Highway 54 at about 11:00 p.m. CST right on the outskirts of Camdenton Missouri when I noticed a large sphere on the left hand side of the highway above a commercial building (it was South).  I thought it was a large dealership type balloon at first, but it started moving very slowly across the highway in a zig zag style fashion. I immediately slowed my motorcycle speed down to about 10 mph, as I was transfixed on the object and could not keep my eyes off of it.  I thought it was maybe a hot air balloon ride as I got closer and thought it was amazing that they had hot air balloon rides so late and so low to the ground in the Ozark hills. It was a spherical type object but was not static in shape...it was hard to identify what it was for some reason. I couldn&#39;t see any type of hot air balloon basket, but for some reason I felt as if I was being watched while riding on the bike. I kept wanting to pull my bike over to take a picture, but was too amazed at the object that I didn&#39;t for some reason. It was large (the size of a small house) and floating about 150 foot above the ground...it was reddish colored with a glow (I thought the glow was the fire for fire for the hot air balloon). It passed right over the top of me along the highway and was hovering along the right side of the highway (the North side). I was trying to find a place to pull my motorcycle over so I could take a picture, but trees were getting in the way, but I could still see the object for another 10 to 15 seconds or so. I finally found an open spot with no trees to take the picture and within seconds of getting off my motorcycle, the object faded extremely fast heading in a 45 degree angle. It was literally gone within a few seconds, but there were no obstructions or trees for it to dissappear b! ehind. I t couldn&#39;t have been a hot air balloon because of the exit speed and how low to the ground it was. It was definitely sphere-like. The whole experience lasted only a minute or two, but I have tried to rationalize what I saw almost every minute of the day since then (It was 6 days ago). The professor&#39;s cabin who I was staying at knew what I had seen, as he had seen the exact same type of object hovering above Lake of the Ozarks 3 years ago in late fall 2006. We are co-workers at a University...both professors. He told me that I could come forward with his information as well. Him and his wife both witnessed the object hovering above Lake of the Ozarks for about 5 minutes...they could not believe their eyes...and were also so transfixed that they didn&#39;t capture it on film. He informed me that he kicks himself all the time for not taking a picture or video, but for some reason he was so mesmerized he didn&#39;t move. The fellow professor and his wife never told anyone but relatives in the past...but him and I have talked for hours in the past 6 days to try to rationalize what we saw, but there is no rational known explanation of the object, how it moved, it&#39;s size, shape, and aura around it. I have never been an avid UFO follower and was not looking for a UFO...it found me...and I completely believe and now intend to spend my summers investigating this phenomenon (as a professor my summers are fairly free). I will help you in any way I can...I am 100% CERTAIN that I witnessed a UFO...as a lawyer and professor I am very skeptical without evidence...but the evidence was literally about 150 feet right above in front of me...it was the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed in my life. I will remain anonymous for now, but if for proof or other purposes you may request me to come forward, I may at some later time.<n>

These objects were very high up with strobing light.  About :30 seconds after they passed overhead a separate blimp-like object / could have been three smaller objects in tight triangle formation, or a single blimp...very hard to tell. This set of lights trailed the just-passed set of lights, but much slower, as if left behind or dragged.  Weird.  Faint headlight light projected from the front of the 3 - similar to if you ever looked up in a movie theater and could see the projector light above you.  Creepy...don&#39;t care to see it again.

We were in our sleeping bags looking into the sky in the bed of his truck, we noticed a set of stars in a triangular shape; discussing the unusual shape of the stars we then noticed a bright flash covering the diameter of one of the corners. A white light then emerged from the star and began to streak across the sky making a zig zag like pattern. We followed the object by pointing at it and after aproximately 30 seconds the object turned back towards the corner of the triangular stars and faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were pretty shaken up by this and our hair was standing on end, we could barely sleep after that, very exciting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I reached up to close the camper shell&#39;s back window, I noticed a bright light almost directly overhead. I also noticed it was moving slowly to the Northeast. It was brighter than Arcturus, which is also about overhead at this time, and brighter than the usual aircraft which fly overhead, so I listened for the sound of a jet, which usually accompanies &#39;normal&#39; aircraft that fly overhead. Although many are high altitude flights, the sound still should have been audible by that point. There was no sound, and the single point of light was not blinking, so I thought that perhaps it was something other than a commercial or military flight, perhaps a very reflective satellite - although I&#39;d never seen one this bright - and started counting about 5 seconds after it passed the zenith. I continued counting and moving across the street as it went behind pine trees to observe it until it disappeared over the mountains to the Northeast, at an altitude of about 15 - 20 degrees above true horizon. The heading (ref&#39;d to true north) was estimated at about 40 degrees. The speed seemed very steady throughout the sighting. Altogether the sighting lasted for a count of 127 seconds, from just past zenith to disappearance over the horizon. It took about 10 seconds to gather my tools, go inside and check the time on an &#39;atomic clock&#39;, which showed 20:33:45. There was no sound from the object at all, the apparent brightness was approximately between that of Jupiter and Venus in the early morning sky and did not fluctuate much, if at all. There was no discernable blinking light, just a steady white color. It did not change noticeably in brightness from overhead to disappearance, as a commercial or military flight usually does - i.e. when the forward lights are blocked by the rest of the jet or plane. The sky was clear of clouds, and although the sunset is &#39;officially&#39; at 19:40 at this latitude, the mountains su! rroundin g the valley give us a sunset at about 19:15 and dusk lasts about an hour . A few of the brighter stars were just visible. Moonrise was a few minutes ago at about 21:20 (from my position).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought it was a plane since I live near PDX but i soon realized it was not a commercial plane. It was also just sitting there up in the air, and that wasn&#39;t right either. All of a sudden it just disappeared. The way it was shaped was there was a long rectangle. Down at the bottom of the rectangle there were two circles, one on each side. Then at the top there was a half circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then, we saw one and about 2 inches behind it, we saw another one following it. It maintained the same distance from the other one. They were like very bright stars. They were moving from Southwest to Northeast; the opposite direction of satellites. They moved in that direction for a couple of seconds, then  appeared to turn to the left. They had no blinking lights like an airplane. Their turn to the left may have just been that they turned out toward space because both lights dimmed at that time.

I came home that night and when I walked in my grandfather said that they mentioned on the local news that we would be able to see the space station tonight at a certain time. (possibly 10:55) He said last time it was in the area it passed right over our house.  So we proceeded to walk outside, we saw my uncle and his friend were across the street waiting for it as well.  So we&#39;re waiting and waiting, watching the blinking lights of a few planes, when i see a bright white light (non-blinking) heading towards my house, I said to my grandfather there it is!..  I was instantly shot down by him saying no thats not it as he points to the south of where I was looking, it was another light, bright orange moving very fast.  This orange light seemed to be a larger light than the one I first saw, probably because it was closer.  So my grandfather, my uncle his friend and I were all fixed on the orange light, convinced this was! the space station.  When my grandfather looks to where I first pointed and it was that white light I first saw now cruising right over our house, he said then oh there it is.  We all decided that was the space station, but then moved our eyes back to the bright orange light having no clue what it could be.  My gramp was in the air force for years and he said he&#39;d never seen anything like that, It then move out of our view over the tree/city line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The space station and the object were both moving from Southwest to Northeast. All of this occured within a few minutes, and there was no sound. The orange light was constant, not blinking or changing in appearance whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that month there was a news report from a town maybe 20-25 minutes Northeast of us, about a reported UFO sighting, and the report had pictures.

I have been seeing white star-like orb UFO&#39;s. These orbs can dim or get very bright. They are low in the atmosphere and appear at various times of the night and in many different positions in the sky. They speed up and slow down and make sharp maneuvers at times.  I usually see one at a time so I do not know if there is more than one or if the same one is appearing over and over in the sky cruising along.  I have been wanting to get one on film getting brighter but have not had that opportunity until on this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approx 10:45pm EST after I had just filmed the orb passing by some stars I sat back down and continued to skywatch. I was scanning the sky with my eyes and looked above me to catch a glimpse of a very bright, low, star-like object maybe a few hundred feet passing over where I was sitting.  It was very low and very bright. It was moving West to East.  I jumped out of my chair and began to film it. I was so astonished at the complete silence of this slow moving object!  I could not see if it was a structured craft or what it was at all.  All I could see was the bright light.  You can see how low and bright this object was when it passes the stars as it is moving across the sky. I am an avid skywatcher and have been involved with this UFO phenomenon my whole life. I have filmed airplanes, helicopters and satellites and other various explainable aircraft.  This was NONE of those things!  The complete silence and appearance of this UFO light was amazing and I am so very grateful I was able to document it! I have the other UFO orb footage from various days in June and July I will upload after this one as well as what I filmed directly before this awesome sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: My camcorder was running behind an hour.

That is why this one stood out. Instead of the normal color of light, it was glowing a dark amber color. it was heading in a N NW direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my room mate what she thought it was, she didn&#39;t know.  We continued to watch it, as it flew in our direction. It was very high up.  As it got closer, it just blinked out. I could still see it though.  Against the dark sky, the shape was very defined.  It was almost jellyfish like, in the way it was moving around as it flew forward. As I ran down the sidewalk, it was almost above my head.  I could see it very clear. It was very large, rotating in a circular motion, and continuing on its course. It the got directly above my head, and instantly changed it&#39;s course sharply to directly west. I continued to watch it, and finally lost sight of it when it flew beyond the path of some trees.<n>

It MAY have slowed, hesitated or varied slightly in it&#39;s course, but I can not be sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially, I thought this may be the Shuttle or ISS catching the glint of the sun that had just set over the horizon, but the shining was FAR brighter than previous sightings of known space objects and the light did not fade or dissipate as it went towards the visible edge of the sky (we have mountains fairly close there).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to exit the hot tub and proceed to the front of my home to maintain visibility as my neighbors home and shed quickly blocked my view.

On top of the aircraft was a pole with what seemed to be a flag or some object on top. It started at the tree line and took off fast a silently. As we watched a piece of the light from the aircraft shot off of the ship and stood still in the sky. The aircraft did not loose form or amount of lights.

7/7/09 21:30|Milwaukee|WI|Other|5 minutes|Seen Three aliens three different times outside my window within 2 weeks|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72662.html|422|ndxe200907| Seen Three aliens three different times outside my window within 2 weeks<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw three translucent inter-dimensional beings out my window three times in 2 weeks   I was sitting on my recliner in my living room.  I was watching my Television and I noticed something in the trees.  I looked through my big glass window that looks onto the back of the apartment building. I saw three aliens or some kind of beings in my trees.  At least I thought they were in the trees. The tree line is about 10 feet my window.  They were about 4  feet off the ground. I was scared to death, I could not move, I just froze with fear.  There were three of them. They were sitting side by side. At least I think they were sitting, hard to tell because they were translucent. I could see right through them, seeing the leaves move behind them.  Like in the movie “Predator” they were kind of see through but the outline of them was visible. They were on a platform.  They had very long arms and the width of their bodies were about 6.  Their height was maybe 1 foot, hard to tell since I was not sure if they were sitting or standing.  This was about 10.am around the first week of July, of 2009 in Milwaukee Wisconsin.  I am in an apartment complex that is two stories’ high and 10 apartments wide.  Mostly very nice Mexican people live here.  I am from Georgia.  I mention that in case this becomes significant since there are so many sightings of  UFO’s in Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In no way were these Grays aliens that people talk about.  The face was cone shaped. I could not really make out eyes or any features.  Obviously they were cloaked or thought they were invisible, I do not know.  They stared at me the whole time, never looking around, just right at me for about 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally I got the nerve to stand up slowly and make my way to the front door. I knew the window was open; I wanted to close it because I was afraid they would come in and abduct me. Or do experiments as we hear about what happens to people.  As I had my back to them for only a second, I turned to look back but they had gone. I then went too quickly to my neighbor’s apartment. She asked me if I had seen a ghost. I said just something very weird. I would not tell her for being afraid of her thinking I was crazy. I was so afraid I told no body. Not even my boyfriend who was out of town for the next two weeks. I was there alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to let you know. I am a 48 year old woman from Georgia. I do not do drugs, I do drink a beer here and there but I had not had any beer for about a week. I have never hallucinated or imagined anything in my whole life. I am not on any prescription drugs and have never been on them. I was really seeing this and wish I had never had. So when Mark came home from working in Canada I did not tell him even though I was still scared. A couple mornings after he was home he woke me to ask if I have ever seen anything weird out the back window.  I said yes, why are you asking me? He was scared, I could tell as he started to tell me that he saw three beings out the back window in the trees that he could see through. It was about 5:30 as we slept in the living room all night since it is cooler then than our bedroom. We have had placed our mattress on the floor near the front door. He said there were three of them side by side with cone faces, long arms and almost he could make out! eyes or holes where there would be eyes. He described them exactly as I had seen them and also they were on a platform. He said the platform was a milky color but still translucent. He could see the outline and see the leaves right through them. He said their heads were moving up and down, to the right to the left looking at the back of out apartment building. He was sure they did not see him since he was so far from the window near the front door on the mattress which is on the floor. When I am in my recliner I am only about 4 feet from the window. He said they were there for about 4 minutes also then they disappeared. When I asked him to point right where he saw them, it was interesting because they were on the right side of our window but when I saw them they were on the left side. Remember now both times were in the morning and same description. He said they were doing something with their hands, maybe working controls? I don’t know, I am just scared out of my mind the! y will come back again. I was happy I could share this bizarre! happeni ng in out lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So about two days after Mark had seen them I was in my recliner watching Television. It was around 9 a.m in the morning. I saw movement in the trees again and this time there was only one of the beings. I saw him for about only about 1 minute or minute and a half or so. This time he was in the middle of the window about the same height in the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His cone shaped face and long hanging arms, looking right at me. I was very scared and had a look of fear on my face. Mark was in the room and when he saw my face he saw I was scared but when he turned his head to look it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I have been analyzing this highly unusual event. I am scared all time. I am in fear they will take mark or myself to where to do what? Why appear behind an old run down apartment building in virtually the same place area in the trees? This has reoccurred three times in the morning hours. From about a minute and a half to about 4 minutes they stay to study mark or I? To take readings of the Earth, say maybe they are measuring the Earths magnetic field, gasses in atmosphere? Are they planning an attack on mankind? Do they want to become our friends? Learn our language? Are they just as curious about us as we are of them? Do they want to reproduce with our species? Do they want to use us as food? So many things run through our heads, WHY WHY HERE? Why not appear at the White House, a museum, a school, a park or in a science laboratory? Why behind an old apartment building at OUR WINDOW? Are the other people in the apartments seeing them also? I am not ready to ask around. I want to move out of here as quickly as I can but for financial reasons I don’t see that happening anytime soon. Maybe they will never appear again and my nerves can calm down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend Mary is vey excited about this. She wants to see them very badly so she can take photos or video tape them to show the world. She says this is very important for the world to see that beings are showing up here repeatedly. She says they probably are not from another world but from another dimension. That maybe their laboratory in their dimension is situated right there at all times but the veil from our dimensions are opening up. They are not really in the trees at all but in their time and a different dimension. They could be opening and closing them. They are showing up as almost invisible, is that because they are scared that we will shoot them? They know enough that this is a common reaction among humans, Shoot first ask questions later. Do they even know we see them at all? Mary says we can roll up a ball of yarn with a long string on the end. When they appear throw it at them, it might go into their place and we might see just a string hanging in mid air! when they closed the veil. The yarn will not show harmful intent because we could put a note on it saying :Become our friends, Talk to us, we know your there. We could put a little present inside the ball of yarn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She wants to bring in a high tech video camera, digital camera, regular camera, infrared camera, aura camera and a meter she has that can pick up very low frequencies that turns it into voice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It made no sound and remained in one place. I asked my wife to come and see, and she agreed that it was not a normal object. She went to get the camera, and as i was focusing to take a picture it zipped quickly north and then very fast took off west and out of sight. It appeared to be about 150ft away and 50 feet up. IT WAS AWESOME! This is the first time I have ever seen anything in the sky that could not be explained.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While we were sitting there, I noticed a light coming out of the south and pointed it out to my girlfriend.  We both watched as this light slowly traveled in a NE direction.  At one point, when it was at its closest to us, another plane was flying over the light (could easily make out FAA lights on it).  The object was a solid light, about the size of a grain of rice at arms length.  I thought the color was white while my girlfriend thought it had yellow around it.  As it approached and was heading away, the light it put out was steady and solid.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend thinks it was more of an egg shape, I seem to think it was more oval.  The sighting lasted about 5 mintues.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its altitude is unknown, but it appeared lower than the airliner that flew over it.  At first I thought is was a Sat. or the ISS, but it was too large to be a sat. and to low to be the ISS.<n>

I want another try. It&#39;s something you don&#39;t forget.  What actually got me thinking about it again, surfing channels,there was a show on Discovery channel and they talked about possible energy forms, mercury being one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My story;  It was a clear day, a few high cumulus clouds and at least 6 airliners at different altitudes, 20-30 thousand feet.  We get a lot of air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving north on interstate 95,exit227 I travel this road occasionally.  I happened to be looking at a cloud when I saw this cigar shaped object moving through the cloud, I might have seen it for 5 seconds It was moving east to west, about the same speed of the aircraft  around it.I thought,how can all these aircraft not see this?I’d say it was 20-30thousand ft high, may be 20 miles out. The airliners were barely visible other than a con trail. This object was a lot bigger,maybe as big as 6 greyhound buses, big enough to see in detail It seemed to be 1 dimension,there were 3 separate  rotating screens[blue like the sky with small clouds inside ringed by this flowing silver[that&#39;s where the mercury comes in] I was alone [unfortunately] I only saw one. I mentioned  it to my son afterwards and  he found a picture  on u-tube, they called it a helix. A grainy picture  but the same shape. I’ve thought about going back to that spot ,under the same conditions and looking for it .The experience has been both exciting and a little scary.Was it some sort of craft or a portal?I’v often looked into the night sky and wondered are we alone?Now I know we’re not.One odd thought I did have, the other day my wife and I were headed south on I 95,got to this exit and I wondered aloud,where did that saying every cloud has a silver lining originate?  I’v been married  33yrs,raised two sons, I do have a web site mrcanoe.com.I would be happy to answer any questions.

There where alto-stratus clouds that the objects where moving above and below.  The keep going in a circle over and over slowly going east.  I would loose them and pick up the objects 30 degrees away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I probably would not have looked up if not for the sound of two military jets.  They where circling around the area to the north east.  This is not seen around here too often as there are no major airports for 60 miles or so.  They looked like F-15s, but I don&#39;t think they fly those any more.  They were definitely military jets one seen very clearly, and the other jet was heard.  There are not any bases close by.  While I was looking up to see the jets something else caught my eye.  There where maybe a dozen or so objects to the east - south east possibly over Juneau, WI area.  The best way to describe them is to liken them to a school of fish.  They where going in a large circle moving fast and in sync like a school of fish.  I lost them once and went to get my wife to see them.  While looking up to see them again, I reacquired the strange lights due east from my position. The lights seemed to be very bright -9 magnitude and then change to very dark all while going in a complete circle. The circle seamed to be horizontal (side to side) and not vertical (up and down). At times seen above the clouds and at times seen below.  The objects where moving quite fast in a clock wise circle.  The second sighting did not last very long and my wife was not able to see the objects. It seamed that the objects disappeared and less than a minute or two later a jet was again heard at a very fast rate, and you can clearly tell the difference between military and civilian jets.  The cloud layer was very thin higher altitude clouds.  I would guess the clouds at the time to be 6000 to 10000 ft.  At least one military jet was heard again, but not see after the last ufo sighting.  Sounded very fast, but not super sonic.  Possibly super sonic at high altitude when jet was last spotted heading straight east toward lake Michigan.  I would very much like to find out what these objects where, and where the jets involved at all, or was it all just coincidence.<n>

It took about 5 minutes for it to cross the sky last night, and tonight we spotted it halfway through the sky - and it took maybe three minutes to cross the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first I thought that this might be a satellite, since I have witnessed this before.  What set apart this sighting was the fact that the light did not follow a elipitcal flight path across the night sky.  This light followed what would be considered a normal flight path of a plane close to the horizon.  The light was not a airplane since no strobes were observed, and the light maintained a constant level even as it moved away from us.  The speed was constant and no erratic turns were observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He did that from time to time, but after three days I became worried and called for him off and on throughout the day.  Early the next morning just as the sun was beginning to rise, I noticed something dark in the grass near the road.  The form was not there the night before.  Since he was a black cat I thought that he might be sleeping there.  I began walking down the driveway calling his name.  I had a flashlight and shone it on the dark form in the grass.  At first it looked like a pile of leaves, but as I walked around the form I could see his face.  He was covered with live oak leaves.  We don’t have live oaks in our yard, but there are live oak leaves all over the ground of the empty lot across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was getting brighter and I could see that my cat was missing a lot of hair and I could follow a trail of tufts of his hair that led back across the street to the empty lot.  It looked like he was dragged across the street with his tail pointing away from the lot making me think that he was dragged by it.  There aren’t any dogs roaming the neighborhood, but I looked at his tail which had become almost entirely hairless to see if there were any bite marks, but I saw none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cat was missing his left ear and it looked like the ear had been cut off and was still bloody.  I could smell that he was decomposing, so I went to get a shovel to pick him up to be buried.  As I turned him over and his mouth was wide open and full of maggots.  All of his body was covered with maggots, except the ear that was bloody.  I don’t understand why the maggots wouldn’t be in the ear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would not think any further than it being a wild animal attack, but with no bite marks and the ear was cleanly severed from his head.  I have reported several sightings including the circular object that was in our neighborhood and followed my car down the street, so I suspect that this may not be so simple a death.  I’m not crazy and have thought long and hard about posting this.<n>

Another one of the maintenance guys said he saw something like that too, he said it was weird almost like it was taking pictures because the light would get bright then turn off.  They both agreed that that the light was stationary and turned off and on a total of 2 to 3 times.  Well I have seen this bright light in the sky a total of 3 times since then.The first time it was about 2:30 am located in the western sky ,thats when a bright light caught my attention from the corner of my eye.  I kept looking in that direction and saw nothing but a few seconds later there it was again, got real bright then dimmed out. The second time I was with a friend he said hey look over there it&#39;s one of those bright lights again.  It was in the northern sky about 3:00 am and it was there for about a good 2 minutes turning on and off about 6 times in 30 second intervals.The most recent sighting is July 7,2009 at 4:45 am I was outside setting up my tripod for my telescope, I was excited to see Jupitor for the first time through a telescope, the skys were clear and Jupitor was really bright. As I was getting lined up with the spotting scope there it was a bright light that would dim out for about 30 seconds then reappear. It repeated this process about 3 times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This bright light doesn&#39;t give off that gleem like Venus and Jupitor give off, but the size and brightness are about the same.It does give a pulse like affect as it seems to grow in brightness then dims out and then repeats that cycle about 3 times. It seems to be stationary I have never seen it move.<n>

It was about 11:33 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up overhead and spotted a brilliant orange object, somewhat circular in shape.  It was about half the diameter of the holes punched in three-ring notebook paper held 30&#34; from the eye. I estimated its altitude at 25K feet or higher.  From my position near the intersection of the Shasta View Drive and Tarmac Road, at 40*34&#39;49N X 122*19&#39;26W, the object appeared to be at 85 degrees above the horizon to the SSW.  Judging by its altitude, it was probably directly over the southwestern margins of the city limits of Redding, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, its coloration was steady and unchanged; the object was stationary.  But as I watched, it began to change shape, with several smaller orange objects coming from it, rapidly separating from the main object to a short distance then momentarily flashing and winking out, never to be seen again. This happened about  four different times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The main object would alternately appear as a circular shape then dim slightly from a bright orange color to a bright red and back again, and as it did so, it took on the appearance of multiple spheres clustered together; very much like the oft-cited theodolite camera footage shot near Area 51 some years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But then the large object quickly winked out itself, going from bright orange to red, then to a brownish hue and vanished completely. It was completely out of sight for about a second and would suddenly flash and reappear in another location a short distance away, where it again stood motionless.  This on-off-on and sudden relocation event happened about six times.  Held at arm&#39;s length, these &#34;jumps&#34; would appear about three inches from point to point.  At an altitude of 25,000 feet altitude or more, this represents a jump of about a half mile or more, (transitioned instantly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I debated whether to run and grab my high-powered binoculars, but was afraid that the object would disappear before I could return to view the phenomenon.  The object moved in several directions in this disappear-reappear sequence and finally, as I was on my cell phone yelling for my girlfriend out in Palo Cedro to go out and look, it began moving in a south easterly direction and vanished just as she was just stepping outside. The sighting lasted about three minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the International Space Station (ISS) pass overhead moving in a northeasterly direction about an hour earlier, so I know this was neither a sighting of nor mis-identification of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After checking with the administration at the Redding Municipal Airport, I was told they have a recently installed ARTS-3C radar system that is &#34;slaved&#34; to the TRACON System at the Oakland Bay Airport, but they have no provisions for recording the returns locally.  I checked the internet for live radar feeds, but I guess there aren&#39;t any available to &#34;mere civilians&#34;.  Maybe it might be possible to find out if there is some ATC radar tapes that could be examined for a signature on this.<n>

I then noticed that this object has it was traveling through the night sky appeared to be lowering in altitude because it got larger and brighter in appearance. In fact the object seemed to be at that moment a falling star that’s how bright it became, and just has quick has it became large and bright, the object became smaller in size and then dimmed out like it was gaining altitude again then became the same size and color, and brightness has it was when I first thought it was a satellite. The object began to slow down and the stopped completely for not more than a few seconds then disappeared like it just began to do a vertical climb in altitude. I lost sight of the object within 3-5 seconds... I knew it could not have been a satellite because satellites do not fall &amp; rise in altitude and become has bright has a falling star, and they do not come to a complete stop &amp; then do a vertical altitude climb, and within a few seconds disappear out of sight. The object also had no navigation lights such has the normal red, and green that all conventional aircraft including military air craft exhibit. This object was very strange in that it did not look like anything remotely conventional or terrestrial including in the way it maneuvered in the night shy. The closest resemblance was that of a falling star, and even then it broke the rules of a falling star, has it began to fall then immediately got very bright then started to do a vertical climb then stop then climb again within a few seconds completely out of sight... End.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My first thought is to look for the typical signs of an airplane. Flashing lights, and the typical sounds you hear when a plane is flying overhead. Well none of these were there and as this light passed over us there were three other lights behined this that were i guess you could call it sparkling. Again there was no noise. All of a sudden these lights were gone as soon a they appeared. About a minute later an actual airplane flew over with all signs of an airplain. Strobe lights and the sounds of the engiune. Pretty much confirming what we saw before that was not normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After about 3 min of talk I noticed what looked like a dim, pulsating, blue star moving extremely fast to the south west and ascending.  It was moving entirely to fast to be a plane and also moving to slow to be a shooting star. It proceeded to change its course to direct west and straightened its course, then went out immediatly. After about 30 sec I noticed a much brighter and continuous white light bigger than the first (about 3 times larger.) and also much lower and closer, moving at about the same speed as the first, heading in a north west direction. It proceeded to ascend also and then abruptly faded out like a shooting star about roughly a mile from my position. This was not a shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this event about 3 min to 5 min later I noticed a 3rd light that immediately shot out of the northern sky and descended to the southern sky. It then proceeded to fade out. The 3rd light I believe was a normal shooting star (Meteorite).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to be swarming aound the illuminated roof of the West Penn hospital in Friendship Park.  They moved about at high rates of speed and changed direction very rapidly, appearing to chase each other off and on, sometimes disappearing into a relatively cloudy sky.  They were too fast to be any kind of conventional aircraft and too large to be birds.  This went on for more than 20 minutes.<n>

This was lower then the clouds as I watched it pass under NOT THROUGH some clouds.I would say where it was between me and the moon it was close enough to hear if it was a plane or jet..because I have seen planes and jets at that distance and heard them also...This was not...no sound..no blinking and the light was yellow to bright white.It did not leave no trail..and there were not many clouds in the sky as it was pretty clear with a huge bright moon.I was thinking of calling the near town airport to see if they had anything land or noticed a blip on the radar...n but did not. I also have seen satellites go ever but this object was way to low for that type of sighting.This light was not moving like a meteor or a any of the space Debre either that would be entering the atmosphere and it was not burning up either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of ISS.

There was a green light in the sky, but it was too close to be a star.  It was moving side-to-side and hovering, like nothing I have ever seen before.  I jumped in my car and drove to its location.  It was a green glowing circle shaped object, about 100ft above us, floating.  We watched and took pictures as more bystanders showed up.  It slowly started to move NE.  Then all of a sudden it shot 30 ft east in seconds.  It was unbelievable.  We watched it move half a block east then come to a stop.  A police officer eventually showed up and asked us what we were doing.  He saw the object also and had no idea what it was.  Around this time we saw a white wire sticking out of both sides of this UFO.  I have no pictures of it though.  It eventually went very high in the sky and slowly faded away.  It was the strangest thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No one seems to notice the strange, fading dot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusion: Whatever it was, it radiated light unlike an airplane, a pallor probably with a more sinister purpose than communication. It faded away without hesitation, like it knew that it was being watched. It disappeared very quickly although its outline was still large, which means that the object wasn’t flying directly away.<n>

My husband is a very skeptical, CPA, who doesn&#39;t believe in anything he can not see, so for him to watch this, much less video the incident, is a huge sign that is was something very strange. He had to leave to get to work on time, but as he drove he kept looking for it. After floating along slowly, suddenly it was gone.

I then noticed that it was hovering and moving slightly in a circular pattern.  It was not an airplane or a helicopter.  It made no audible noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for about 15 minutes.  I don&#39;t have any idea how long it was there before I noticed it or how long it was there after I stopped watching it.  I could see that the object had at least 3 different lights though at first it appeared to be a single light.  I got my digital camera and attempted to take photos but they wouldn&#39;t come out.

(also a white ball of light)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because this happened a few years ago, i can deduce a exact date upon request of some minor research...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My (now) wife and I decided to sneak away from our family to lay on the beach. While we watched the stars, we saw a light approaching from down beach that seemed like a helicopter at first. We realixed that the light was not a coast guard helicopter with a spotlight, but rather a silent, and onmi-directional while light. The light pulsed slowly and rather unsteadily as it approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was excited and I focused in the light as though i could could pull energy from it (an idea I got from Whilhem Reich). To our amazement, the light dimmed and slowed in approach. Soon, the light turned in direction and sped away very quickly, continuing to dim untill the object was unseeable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the profound incident, we were buzzing. We layed on the beach and stared at the sky. My wife and I felt very serene, but we felt as if energy was pulsing between us as we layed in the sand holding hands. Eventually, she dosed off to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happed next will leave an idellable impression on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared directly ahead of me at a small patch of clouds blocking the stars when suddenly a craft shook into view in front of the cloud (or it came out of them). But the ship actually shook vilently side to side for about a second untill my eyes could focus on it. Then it decended somewhat quickly and directly towards me (I was so captivated I hardly tried to wake my wife).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was more arrowhead shaped than triangle. It was solid and contained three unblinking red lights (one in each corner) and a single, slightly larger white light in the very center. It made absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft slowed more as it approached the beach and it flew directly overhead of us. The scale was hard to judge, but it encompassed my whole view as i looked directly above me. It seemed to be either the size of a large passenger jet (in length) at about two hundred feet or possibly very large at an unkown altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued in-land at an increadibly slow pace, and i watched it as it passed over the beach houses and continued out of the line of sight. (Being away from the resorts made altitude estimation difficult)  I regret not reporting this earlier, but the details are so vivid to me, I think about the incident often. I have no fear attached to the incident, strictly awe and wonder. Plus, I wish to contribute to the collective knowledge of the topic. (3D animation can be produced upon request)<n>
7/6/09 01:00|Columbia|MD|Unknown|30 seconds|Light solid blue semi-circle of light projecting onto bedroom floor.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70916.html|453|ndxe200907| Light solid blue semi-circle of light projecting onto bedroom floor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On July 6, 2009, around 1:00am, I woke up to tend to my infant son in another room who was crying.  When I returned to my bedroom, there was a bright light solid blue light shining onto the carpet on the floor in my bedroom.  It was in the shape of a semi-circle.  It almost looked like a half of a spotlight shining on the floor. I am not good with measurements but I think the diameter was probably 8 inches long (maybe the size of the top half of a small personal pizza.) The light was still and did not move.  I did not hear any noise outside.  At first I thought maybe it was a car headlight.  Then I realized that this explanation was not possible since our bedroom backs up to a heavily wooded area and there are no cars around.  Our bedrooms are also on the second floor (we live in a townhome) and the blinds  were halfway down so there was no way a light could project into our room and shine onto the floor in the shape of a semi-circle. I began looking around to see if I could find the source of the light.  I could not see any blue light coming in through the window, but I decided to look out of the window anyway.  As I took a step forward, the light on the floor disappeared.   When I looked outside I did not see anything or hear anything.  I looked for planes and or helicopters that might have had search lights but I saw nothing in the sky.  The whole episode lasted approximately 30 seconds or less.  Today I called the non-emergency police number to see if there had been any other sightings of this light or if there had been any search helicopters in the area. I was told there were no other reportings of any lights but it was a possibility a helicopter was in the area.  However, the dispatcher was unable to confirm whether there was a helicopter in the area at that time.  I found the incident VERY unsettling!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober minded.  She was shaken by the experience.  PD))<n>

The first object was orange almost plasma like in appearance and shaped in a cylindrical type fashion.  The other object looked star like in appearance and was approximately 20 feet behind matching EXACT speed and direction in a left to right fashion between the rooftops of the house on the opposite side of the street as we where facing through the front window of the house.  I would approximate the height to be about 500 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We only witnessed these craft between one set of roof tops both to only wink out before emerging again.  THE SIGHTING WAS VERY CLEAR and other reports in there has been other witnessed events in the street to the same description and in point of fact this was one of friends second sighting that week having told me earlier that day !!!!<n>

My husband and I went outside in the parking lot to smoke.  An acquaintance was outside as well and alerted us to a flaming red/orange light in the shape of a long, narrow, lateral rectangle in the southern sky, moving slowly and horizontally on a very determined smooth course, being the size of a nickel at arms length, and at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object as it headed due north reaching closer to the horizon made a steady incline, yet it did not become smaller as most aircrafts would at an incline-it just disappeared.  It was proceeded by three more on the exact same coarse as the first from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the time of these sightings, several other people came out to witness.  There were a total of nine witnesses including a confused government contractor working for the Department of Homeland Security&#39;s Transportation Safety Administration.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next round of objects (three total) originated from the west to east (toward us) then veering off to the north. Heading in the same northern direction as the other four. Directionally as they headed toward us they appeared as round flaming red/orange balls, but as they veered their coarse to the north we could then see the rectangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night sky was very clear and there were no trails from these objects. It was obvious They had a definite, intelligent flight plan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day the phone system of the entire Motel was out of order.<n>

We like to watch storms roll in from there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still day light out and the clouds were fairly high and white at this point of the storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after the first or second lightning flash went off I saw something through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved into view it moved at a steady flat pace just below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was in view for about 20-25 seconds, long enough for me to grab my wife and run to the other side of the porch for her to see it before it was hidden by trees &amp; clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not an aviation expert but I&#39;ll describe what I saw comparing it to common items seen in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Holding my thumb and forefinger out at arm’s length it was about 2 inches long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Cessna plane that flies over frequently at a similar distance would be about a 1/4 inch or smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to see it very clearly at first as it was below the clouds and I could see 2-3 lights in back and the same amount up front. I saw the body of the object fairly clearly; it was a pipe or a tube shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The angle it was at, I&#39;d expect to see wings or more of the object, but there were none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is uncommon to have aircraft fly this low in the area and when they do, it is usually small private jets and Cesena type aircraft, all of which can be distinctly heard before being seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object made no noise and traveled at a speed (once again comparing to a Cessna), would be about 4-5 times the speed of a Cesena, possibly more. It&#39;s very hard to put a size/distance to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it moved across my line of sight, it entered the lowest parts of the clouds still fairly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights front and rear seemed to pulse, possibly flash, but it could have been because it was going through the translucent clouds. The lights were all white front and rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was traveling West to East approximately 5 miles North of Highway 80 and I saw it East of FM 450 travelling toward Marshall TX.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I saw had 3 maybe 4 lights that appeared to be round, the number of them was not something I was paying attention to at the time. What I was trying to remember is that the space filled with lights was equal front &amp;/or rear was approximately 1/3 the total distance of the object.  At no time did I see any wings, or tail fins, or any other color of lights but white front and rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is about it, not sure what it was but it was nothing I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading!<n>

His house is high on a hill facing west to the valley below, and the Gore Mountain Range rising above it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The friend who owned the home, noticed a strange object low in the air, across the mountain on the other side. I saw what looked like a balloon above 6 or 7 spherical shaped objects hovering above the ground, and moving northward.  The spheres seemed to move individually, yet seemed like they were all connected, as if a cable was attached to them.  The spheres seemed opaqueWe observed it as it continued to move northward, as if it was probing the area.  It would move upward and downward some, but wouldn’t go very high in the air.  Numerous times, it would move through treed areas.  I thought it would crash,  But it just kept moving through the trees, as if the trees were non-existent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a picture with my camera phone.  One friend got out his binoculars.  He watched through the binoculars, as the spheres moved towards a heard of elk.  The elk raised up, and went running as the spheres got close to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it continue northward on its probing adventure, till it disappeared out of site, north of us.<n>

I was shooting  an outdoor sequence for an online video contest entry.  The footage was a shot of my hand picking up a brick, the camera was to follow the brick as I raised it up.  The shots were successful and I put the footage away for a while intending to work on it later. I have now finally gotten around to it.   It was Friday, July 18 when I finally started editing the footage together.  I was moving through it frame by frame, intending to do some motion tracking for the project.  That is when I noticed a streak cross the frame.  The object appeared distant and slightly obscured by a light cloud cover.  It moved across the screen in a slight upwards diagonal motion the entire sequence lasts only six frames.  However, upon reviewing the rest of my footage I found that there are more indistinct dark spots that cannot be explained, moving in various directions, they seem to be falling from the sky, then stopping, then moving sideways and in one case following each other .  Unfortunately, because the focus of my shots was on my activities all images are not in focus enough to tell what these objects were, but I cannot recognize any of them as being conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know who to tell about this, who I should show this footage to.  Does anyone have any ideas, suggestions, information as to experts that can verify this footage as being real?  Truthfully I&#39;m very much surprised by the whole incident.  Any response, information would be deeply appreciated.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I never saw the objects while I was shooting; I only saw them after they were on my laptop for editing.  They appear as brown spot almost football shaped, I blew up the images and they seem to have form and mass but I am no expert.  The only adjustment made was auto color done with picture project software that I use.  I first thought this was dust until I noticed it was only on two of my photos and they were taken almost one hour apart all the photo in between have no dust at all, and the lens was never cleaned during shooting.

Our friends were visiting from Canada and we were all outside talking, laughing and having a great time for hours.  At about 2:00 am, July 5th three of us looked up in the sky and saw an oval shaped, green luminescent light to the east.  Because it was dark and I don’t know how big this object was, it was difficult to say how close it was.  My depth perception seemed off.  If I used the full moon as a guide for the size of this light, I’d say that looking up, the moon was about the size of a quarter and this green light was about the size of a dime.  At first we thought it was some sort of firework because it just stayed in one spot directly over the roofline of our house for a couple of seconds. Then it started to move. We watched the light travel in an erratic pattern in a southerly direction for about 10 seconds. We were yelling for my husband and son to come out of the house to see this too when suddenly we saw the green light shoot up into the sky.  It went straight up until it was a pinpoint of light like the other stars in the sky. This only took a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my husband and son came outside.  We showed them where the pinpoint of light was and the 5 of us watched the light travel in the sky for about the next 10 minutes.  I’ve seen airplanes and satellites travel in the sky before but this was different.  It did not travel in a straight line.  It zigzagged around the stars.  We watched it move west across the sky then northerly, then it started going in a easterly direction.  Basically, it appeared to be circling the whole sky.  After watching it about 10 minutes, we got kind of freaked out by what we saw and went in the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 46 years old and have worked as a Title I teaching assistant at the local elementary school for 5 years.

We are both in our 30&#39;s with children and have never experienced what we saw that night. In the Northern sky approximately 30 degrees toward the West, was a bright white light, with a flash of red and sometimes blue.  The sky was clear and there was a full moon.  Upon further study with binoculars, this was not a star, an airplane nor a blimp.  I&#39;ve never believed in anything like this, and when I looked through the binoculars, I wanted to vomit.  We tried to think of what else it could be without stating the obvious.  Through the binoculars was an object with squared lights to the left/right, that towards the right side was bright white, and as you looked to the left the lights resemebled LED lights, flashing and moving.  This object sat above the water for approxiamtely 2 hours before it eventually turned and lowered.  The brightest white light was now on the left and it moved further north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Given that the object was visible for two hours, we believe that it may have been a celestial body, perhaps a star, given that the object was &#34;flashing.&#34;  PD))<n>
7/5/09 01:00|Redding|CA|Disk|03:00|Rotating discs with colored lights seen ongoing for 3 weeks in July 2009 over N California|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71396.html|468|ndxe200907| Rotating discs with colored lights seen ongoing for 3 weeks in July 2009 over N California<n> <n><n> <n><n> Beginning late in the first week of july, a number of brightly lit and multicolored discs were witnessed in the vicinity of Redding, California.  The discs were situated approximately 25-40 miles from the area of witness and clustered at the north and west coordinates in small groups, sometimes stacked on one another.  Near Mount Shasta and in the general vicinity of highway 5 is the most prominent location for these discs in the last 3 weeks.  They have also been seen due west over the rugged mountains of Trinity County at approximately the same distance away from the witnesses.  A rough estimation of the distance away is 25-40 miles and elevation above the ground is estimated at 10,000 to 25,000 feet.  All sightings have occurred right around 01:00 hours and most have persisted until 03:00 hours or later with the witnesses all having seen their fill by that time. It is the duration of constant hovering combined with the entirely unusual colored lights that! makes a very convincing argument the objects are not helicopters or airplanes. All four witnesses were satisfied with this conclusion and have agreed their is no &#34;normal&#34; explanation for what has been seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In particular about the craft, they look to be rotating discs oriented horizontally or sometimes tilted at an angle of around 30 degrees. The discs emanate four flashing colors of bright light identified as green, orange, red and blue. The lights flash in a rotation around the perimeter of the discs in an obviously attention getting and unnatural display. The discs have been best described as &#34;Simon&#34; electronic games in the sky rotating. The &#34;Simon&#34; is a game that is still available and consists of four colored lights arranged around a circle that are hit in succession to form a pattern. Surely most people can recall one of these from a television ad at least and visualize the same four colors flashing around the edge of a disc hovering in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are sometimes but not always accompanying craft but normally one flashes more brightly than the others or the others seem to hover near or above a main disc.  The discs do not make fast movements but have been seen to move drastically in the sky in a period of only 15 to 20 minutes.  Witnesses would see and identify the disc, then go indoors for a short while and come back out to see the disc had moved a hand&#39;s span in the sky in only a short time.  There has been reliably one disc in the northern sky near Mount Shasta and also similar discs in the western sky over Trinity County, a bit south of Whiskeytown reservoir.  One of the first sightings involved the disc in the northern sky moving in very small rapid circles side to side but maintaining the same altitude.  Almost like the tip of a pencil drawing small curly-Qs over and over in the same place.  This was much more pronounced than the usual &#34;shimmer&#34; of a star in the sky that results from the atmosphere refracting! the light. The discs were definitely making rapid circling movements while rotating their flashing lights constantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These sightings are complete textbook UFO instances, lasting so long that one has plenty of time to view the object and make a very detailed observation.  These objects are definitely not standard aircraft and resemble nothing seen before by any of the four witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that stars would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witnesses had observed genuine UFO&#39;s.  PD))<n>

It had no lights on it, but it glowed red-orange and pulsated.  We all thought it was a plane on fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we noticed there was a second identical object following behind the first one on the same course at the same altitude.  They passed over our heads and when they were just south of us the leading one accelerated and dissapeared behind the trees.  Simultaneously, the second one seemed to go straight up.  From our view it just shrank, getting smaller and smaller until we could no longer see it. this manuver took less than ten seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until the end they were moving a little slower than the other planes we had seen all day, and on a different flight path.<n>

We watched the light - which was similar in shape to a globe or rounded sphere - as it crossed the sky from west to east.

We were shooting off fireworks, and all of the sudden one of the youger kids had said hey look over there.  So we looked and it was this yellowish-orange light kind of just sitting there. I thought at first maybe its just a firework, but then it started coming towards us.  I looked over to my uncle and said what is that. I remember saying hey maybe it&#39;s a helicopter or a plane, but it was flying way to high to be a helicopter and it had no blinking lights so it couldn&#39;t be a plane.  All of the sudden it turned to our right started moving for a few feet (relative to us).

I began to notice one bright red light that appeared to be hovering about 3 miles away and approximately a quarter mile off the ground. I stopped looking at it until my friend pointed it out to me which made me inspect it more closely. It appeared at first to be a bright red football shaped light  hovering in one spot but by its light I could see a matte black object in the shape of a large oddly shaped airplane. From the point I had first noticed until we both started inspecting it maybe 5 minutes had elapsed with this object which appeared to be at least 50 feet long and wide hovering in one place but as soon as we both looked closer it appeared to get dimmer until we realized it was because it had left at such an amazing speed that the bright light just appeared to get dimmer. it took off at a 30 degree angle headed directly away from us and up into a completely clear sky until it disappeared from distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was about midnight (Eastern Time).<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking Northward are attention soon became focused on a bright orange light which did travel very fast, stop in mid-air, did a u-turn, and zoom in and out of the atmosphere at incredible speeds.  It was like nothing I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made me fearful and curious at the same time, yet I kept my composure due to my daughter and her young friend getting scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object could have been located anywhere from 5-10 miles out at times and much, much further at times,  It would be hard for me to tell or approximate a distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day while talking about it, my other daughter, who was not present on our back deck, said that while at a friends house a few blocks away on the same night also witnessed this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, we did video record this occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my true testimonial as I know it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness forwards video, taken with cell phone camera, of object.

I could not make out the general shape of the object, but did observe that it had one large red light, and a smaller orange light next to, and seemingly behind, the red one. The object executed a shallow turn, gradually heading south. It suddenly appeared to stop, and hovered for several seconds. About this time, an identical object came from same direction, following a seemingly identical flight path. It also stopped, and hovered slightly behind the first object. After it began to hover, a third identical object came into view, and fell into formation behind the previous two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three objects hovered in what I can only describe as a loose crescent formation, for at least 30 seconds. Shortly after the appearance of the 3rd object, I stuck my head in the apartment and told my roommate they should come and see this. They came outside, and witnessed a good deal of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime after the 30 second mark, the first object floated upwards and disappeared. Following this, the remaining objects moved closer together, and almost seemed to touch one another. They then separated, hovered for a few more seconds, and finally drifted upwards and disappeared as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the entire event, from the appearance of the first object to the disappearance of the latter two, was about 90 seconds to 2 minutes in duration. Though, frankly, it&#39;s difficult to say as I was more than a little surprised to be seeing this, and thus wasn&#39;t paying attention to the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These clearly were not fireworks of any kind. Also, the lights on these objects were not consistent with what I&#39;ve witnessed on traditional aircraft. There was no white/clear light, and none of the lights on the objects blinked or flashed at any time. They were also silent, and seemed to have a slight &#34;wiggle&#34; in their movements. There&#39;s a lot of air traffic in my area, so I see planes and helicopters every day. I feel safe in saying these objects were very odd, in both their behavior and appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please feel free to contact me if you need any further information.<n>

DEFINITELY NOT A PLANE, Helicopter nor Blimp  No blinking lights just solid orange round hazy orb (large as in the size of a plane or helicopter) It traveled steadily from almost direct east to west (more like from SE to NW I guess) Like it would have had to go over O’Hare.  It was not going much faster than an airplane coming into and going out of O’Hare at takeoff or landing.  Cant be sure if no sound because fireworks in neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I (both in the accounting profession) were sitting at fire pit enjoying evening.  What was surprising was that it was so low it caught our attention right away.  We both watched as it just steadily went along.  No abrupt movements. It actually could have been taken as a normal flying object, nothing spectacular but for the shape, color and no outlines seen at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another plane was actually coming in (to O’Hare) just to the south of the orb and at maybe the same height.  That pilot had to have seen it!  And, all night we could plainly and clearly see all other planes (their shapes, outlines, lights etc) without question.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, we are quite perplexed at what this was.  I’m sorry if report seems scattered, I’m very excited because this is only the second time I have witnesses something this unusual and have been fortunate to have a witness so I don’t feel like I’m just crazy or &#34;seeing things.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sure you will have many reports on this because it was 4th of July evening and many people had to be outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for having a sounding board for this sort of thing because it is kind of embarrassing and intimidating to report such things.  And it is nice to have a place to go and see if others saw it to confirm it more so.  Or maybe get a sane worldly explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

This is when I had to point it out to my son. 2 objects following same path so close together?  The first one suddenly disappeard.  Then, the second did so too, at the exact same point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then came the 3rd one - again, exactly the same path (n.e. to s.e.?) and disappeared in the exact same spot.  We thought, clouds covering them?  But then we saw an airplane - blinking lights - like you&#39;d expect from a regular airplane - it followed the same path, too.  But, it didn&#39;t disappear like the 3 orange globes, so we know they didn&#39;t go into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What in the heck was that?

So for a solid minute we watched them pass. They were Orange/Red lights that were circular I believe?? More a blur or fuzzy light. At first we thought jets, but they were way to close together and moving at such a strange pace, almost dragging. They were also only light- there was no clear shape. Then...they just dissapereared into the sky. they were there one second then one by one they dissapeared. It was so strange and i was too scared to take a video. one girl got a picture, but no videos, we were all just too shocked. A few were screaming, scared, thought maybe commets. Anyway I just read some articles and saw video clips of others and that is EXACTLY what we saw. Strange and I wish I knew more!<n>

Some one commented that it was probably an amber from the fire works show and I was like the show had been over for a couple hours now. We walked out to the road and an orange sphere object, if i could guess about maybe 10 to 20 ft in diameter about 300 hundred yards away and about 200 yards up, it was just above the height of a water tower, flew by us.   it was too fast but was moving along. Made no noise what so ever.  Had orange glow about it, i couldn&#39;t tell where it was coming from the inside or if it was shinny?  Glowed orange. We all just kind of looked at each other and went back to the porch sat down and talked.  Then another one showed up on the same path as the first one about hour later. We watched it fly by.<n>

I went outside to make sure it was not just a reflection off the glass. High in the western sky and above the broken cloud layer was a large bright red light. It was slowly traveling west to east for possibly 3 minutes. The thin cloud layer did not impede the brightness of the light at any time. After being stationary for 30 seconds, the light became a rapid acceleration to the south and completely disappeared in 10 seconds. I am a private pilot (instrument-rated) and can say definitely this in no way resembled a commercial airplane at the approx altitude of 10,000 feet.  I frequently watch commercial aircraft over my house on approach to Pittsburgh International Airport. This object would have been in PIT’s airspace or above.  Possibly a contact with Pittsburgh ATC could verify a radar contact. The object was much larger and brighter than a commercial high flying aircraft. The color was always a distinct red. It was not airplane navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was not pulsing, twinkling, or flashing, but remained steady. It was larger than a star or a planet (4x approx) (it reminded me of a warning light at the top of a cell tower, but it was much, much higher in the sky). I went outside to observe further. There was a very thin and broken cloud cover, and I could see that it was well above that. The light was very bright red and the clouds never obscured it. I watched it for about 6 minutes (looked through binoculars also, but it still just looked like a steady, round red light).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch, the light slowly started to move (3 or 4 seconds, eastern direction), then it pulsed rapidly and moved rapidly (southern direction, still pulsing) and was gone in another 3 or 4 seconds.

If I was to guess its location I would say it was just southwest of Mt.Rainier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have various experiences with military aircraft and this was not one.  I also have viewed atmosphere and rocket tests from Vandenburg AFB.  This was not one.  This was not a star, planet, flare, swamp gas or weather balloon.  Very doubtfull this was some sort of test from the space station or other man-made object in orbit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judging by the distance from my point of view, and using the size and location of Mt.Rainier as a reference, the object was many times greater in size than a Boeing 747.<n>

I looked up in the sky and saw 3 bright reddish orange lights.  They moved from NW to SE for about 15 seconds before disappearing.  I figured I was seeing flares but I remember thinking it was odd that they were in such perfect line, were glowing steadily and disappeared at perfect intervals, one after the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with friends but didn&#39;t think to tell them as everyone would say they were fireworks (which would be a very logical conclusion, given the time and place).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t until I read reports here on the NUFORC website that I even thought twice about the event.  If people from various parts of Washington all saw these lights at roughly the same time, the lights must have been higher than flares or fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still put my money on the fireworks explanation but I just wanted to add one more data point to this event.<n>

Seen on 07/04/2009 22:24 for 4 min 19 secs. If the moon were 12:00 the Red Object came out of the horizon at 07:30 then increased altitude steadily with the same speed and Heading of direction (Reason Im not saying North South East or West Is I was not familiar with the surroundings). At first glance thought to be Red coast guard helicopter, but as It passed under the moon we could see It was creating Its own Red light. The Red light was under the flat black angular UFO.The best description of the red glow like looking at Red Glowing Moliton Steel.The reason I use the tearm angular Is,I cant explaine the shape of It. Ive tried to sketch a drawing but I just cant seem to get It exact. I know what It Is not. It was not the International space station because It was on ground side of the Clowds. It was not a Jet,Helicopter,Blimp,Small Air Craft because It had no Tracker Beacon or vapor disturbance. It was not a hot air balloon because It was too fast and Entering proximity of no fly zone of Selfridge Air National Guard Base. We lost sight of the UFO because of the Buildings and tree line elevation. This was Real It was Unknown and It was In the Air.The Slang Military/Airman tearm for this is &#34;Rock&#34;=RAUC R=Real A=Airborn U=Unknown C=Craft.To Describe my feelings I would have to say at first Jumpy/shaky but within a few minutes after fulfillment/Collected. When I got home at 02:44 I could not sleep untill after 06:00 and Only slept for 3 or 4 hours<n>

Speed and trajectory was similar to ISS and other satellite flyovers, but the color was bright orange and didn&#39;t appear to change (i.e., no flashing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light continued in a northernly direction, passing to the west of us and maybe an altitude of 70 degrees or so.  Somewhere in the NW direction, it faded in very much the same way that satellites do when they enter the Earth&#39;s shadow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total observation time seemed to be 1-2 minutes, with the light maintaining its magnitude the entire time, except at the end when it quickly faded and disappeared.  The orange coloring seemed to be the oddest part, and given the time of day, I could see how this could be red sunlight from below the horizon glinting off of a satellite (though the length of time and the prolonged intensity makes me doubt this).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound detected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was overcast, and the position of the moon could be easily determined, but no features could be made out through the clouds.  The orange light was clear enough to appear to be beneath the clouds, but there was no way to determine for sure whether the cloud cover extended across the entire sky (i.e., it&#39;s possible that there were clouds blocking the moon, but not this light).  Intellicast.com is reporting the ceiling at 8000&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of the adults present, myself included, have worked in the air freight industry, and are familiar with witnessing commercial aircraft on approach from 10 miles out and closer.  We all tried to debunk this as an aircraft, but could not detect any indicator of such, like wing markers or red strobe lights (especially as the light moved in relation to us, where such indicators should have became apparent).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned home, I verified that ISS was not in the area using heavens-above.com.  A search for &#34;UFO&#34; on Twitter.com showed several similar reports around the same timeframe.<n>

The casino is located on a hillside with an impressive view of the Snoqualmie Valley.  We drove to the top floor of the parking garage in hopes that we would be able to view the fireworks displays in the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were not disappointed.  We enjoyed the beautiful displays across the Snoqualmie Valley.   We were nearly ready to go home when we noticed a large, red, oval light moving very slowly across the sky.  The light was high in the sky just north of Mt. Si, a mountain in the area that is 3,500 feet high.  We watched the craft move slowly across the sky toward Mt. Si.  The light was not blinking, but was a large, solid red light in the sky.  After watching the object for approximately two minutes, the craft suddenly turned and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another couple was standing near us.  They also saw the object.  We began to discuss the large, red, slow moving object in the distant sky.  We all agreed that it was not an airplane, helicopter or fireworks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Excited and amazed, the other couple told us that they had seen the same type of craft the night before, July 3rd, while visiting their son in Sultan, WA.  They had left their son’s home in Sultan and observed two large, red, slow moving objects in the sky.  That night they called their son on a cell phone and he went outside to observe the two red lights in the sky.  They told us that the two lights moved slowly across the sky that night as well. However, they also moved up and down at different times and then disappeared.  This couple was shocked and surprised to see another red object in the sky the very next night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We estimate that the object was 7-8 miles from us at the time we saw it at about 10:15 PM.  It was approximately 3,000 feet high in the sky. Based on the distance away and the size of the object, we are convinced that the craft was incredibly large.  The shape was that of a big circle that had been slightly flattened. The edges of the object were not sharply defined, but somewhat irregular.<n>

It then finally moved straight out into the atmosphere, disappearing.  It then was back, (10 minutes later) at an even lower sighting just below the handle of the big dipper, moving horizontally to the North then West and just sat for 2 to 3 minutes or so.  It then moved out of sight, getting smaller and smaller until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All stars in the night sky were white, moon was bright in the South-East sky and this redish glow moved about, slow then fast, slow then fast.  It was not constant as the satellites moving through the sky, this redish glow moved then stopped many times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was dark as 10 of us watched fireworks around the lake from a boat, we all viewed this object straight up in the southern sky.  It never traveled out of sight moving horizontally.<n>

This thing was covering ground maybe at a rate of 400 miles every 1 seconds it was fast there was no super sonic boom or nothing.Boy the object I saw its really really fast faster than a f-22 raptor never seen something fly that fast and I seen a SR-71 and they are fast but never will be as fast as what I saw.There were a total of 2 wittneses.<n>

The camera was on a tripod and the shutter was released via remote.  Upon reviewing the photos, I noticed a long thin object with lights moving from right to left across many of the photos.  The camera was on a slow shutter setting to record the trails of lights from the fireworks and although the fireworks are streaking, the object is not creating streaks or trails. The lights on the object are clearly defined separately.  I was watching the fireworks live as they happened while only occassionally glancing at the display on the camera.  I never saw anything at all with my naked eye.  I have many photos with no objects in them, yet I have many series of photos with the object moving across the landscape.  I also have many photos of the same landscape taken during daylight hours which reveals no explanation for these objects and lights.  I have sent 2 photos to the director of the ufo reporting center for his examination.  The 2 photos are from a series of 6 shots taken at 10:08PM that show the object moving across the landscape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We watched their big displays go off and then coming from the left into our view was a glowing round orb moving across the sky from west to east and moving towards the direction of the full moon.  We watched it move smoothly across the night sky and it was lovely.  Reddish/orange ...looking like it was lighted within moving swiftly across.  I began to take pictures when someone said “Look, what IS that?” I watched and saw what I would describe as a fascinating ball of glowing orange/red color moving silently across the sky.

I was waiting for my father and brother in law to shoot off the last firework.  I was looking to the South observing the neighbor&#39;s fireworks when a red light caught my attention.  I watched it for about 5 seconds, waiting for it to explode or disappear like normal fireworks.  I realized while I was waiting that I had never seen a firework sit for so long in the sky without disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a red light that about every 3 seconds flashed a gold light from the bottom.  My next guess was that it was an air balloon, then I realized I had never seen an air balloon at 10:pm at night.  The shape - the best way I can describe it is by calling it a circle.  I don&#39;t believe it was an airplane because there were no hazard lights and I don&#39;t think it was a helicopter either.  I don&#39;t really know what I would call it.  It was on a steady path and it seemed to be moving in a line. It didn&#39;t waver, and it seemed to be progressing quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute and a half, I stood up and walked about three and a half feet to join the other 13 individuals who were observing its progress.  None of us were drunk or on any kind of medication.  We all noticed that it had a red light and seemed to be flying about the same level as a commercial airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about three minutes, the object was getting smaller and smaller and it finally disappeared.  One individual had a camera and was able to capture a few pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am no aviation expert, and I don&#39;t know exactly what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above statement is true and accurate to the best of my recollection.<n>

Neither one of us even realized the other had been watching the object.  We all walked to the south end of the back yard to get a closer look.  It was a very bright red/orange object that appeared to glow. It did not blink like lights from a plane it just glowed.  Pictures were taken by one of the people present. It had started it&#39;s course by coming from the south to the north but then slowly changed course and made a turn going southwest.  We kept watching it until it was out of sight.  There was no noise coming from this object like an engine.  It was very quiet.<n>

She said she didn&#39;t tell anyone because she got distracted by all the fireworks. She then said that she saw a red, circular &#39;space ship&#39; that she thought was a balloon at first, but changed her mind when it got closer and she saw that it moved more like a plane, not &#39;bumping around&#39; and there was no string.  She added that it looked to be made of glass with a bright red light inside it.  She said that she felt scared at first and then happy, and that she did not hear anything unusual.  I asked if it had a happy face on it, and she said it did not. I asked if it flashed at all and she said yes, a lighter red or orange, from the middle.  I asked her if she could see the shape clearly, and she said she could not because the light was bright, but that she felt as it went away &#34;In a flat line&#34; it seemed to her that it changed and became longer in shape. She indicated that she first saw it coming from the South at about the same level as the commercial planes that go overhead many times a day, but that when it got closer, it seemed lower and closer than a plane. She feels she may have thought it was higher at first but realized it was much lower when it came closer, not that it suddenly dove down.  When it left, she said it rose slightly and went up and to the West before she could no longer see it.  She said that she did not see the light go out, but it faded into the distance and continued to flash in a regular pattern.  She would like to know where it came from *smiles*. So would we.<n>

My family and I were standing outsied after we had finished up a few fireworks.  I was getting ready to leave when a family member looked up and said what&#39;s that? I looked up and at first thought it was trick someone was playing to try and freak out people during the 4th.  However it&#39;s movement was so odd that I called 5 other family members and said look! We a looked up and saw this object. It then started moving towards the right and then speed up just a bit and moved up. It disappeared up into space as it does when I have seen the space shuttle. When it was almost out of few completely it almost flickered like a twinkling star and then it was gone. I&#39;m not a believer in this sort of &#34;UFO&#34; stuff at all. However, this was something strange. I have tried to find any toys online that would cause something like this but I failed to find anything. If anyone can explain this it would be great. Also there was no noise at all. it was just there. Conditions were completely clear while viewing it. The sky was clear and this was not a firework of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The smaller lights compared to the other light seemed stationary and in the rough shape of a triangle.  I heard people saying &#34;What is that&#34; and people were scrambling to get a camera.   It was going in a straight line, and the light dimmed as it was heading away in a straight line towards the West.  It appeared to be solid, but also appeared to be made of light.  I felt confusion when I saw it, because I could not tell what it was.  The main reason I would not think of it as normal aircraft is because it didn&#39;t have those safety lights, and it didn&#39;t appear to blink, but it seemed to be fading in and our from the orang-ish gold color to the three smaller lights.   While I was watching it, everything seemed to be quieter than normal. Kind of like the same effect snow has - Where everything seems quiet.  I seemed to see a lot of detail in it even without wearing my glasses.<n>

We went about a mile away to the local newspaper building parking lot.  You can see very well from there and not get tangled up in the traffic down on the highway.  There was about 50 people scattered about the parking lot.  We sat our lawn chairs up and relaxed.  As the show started something kept catching my attention in the sky to the right of me. I looked at my husband and he said that yes, he&#39;s been watching it too.  No one else noticed.  They were all focused on the fireworks. It was stable in the sky flashing slow.  Then it started to move.  Very slowly at first.  Then after about 5 minutes it just &#34;shot&#34; away. I have lived in Killeen for about 35 years and I have seen all kinds of military aircraft and flares.  This was neither.  This is also not the first time for me to see things like this here.<n>

At first thought it was just from a firework since it was 4th of July.  But when it didn&#39;t burn out, I noticed it was moving across the sky, in the same flight patterns that I have seen numerous planes take while landing at Harrisburg International Airport.  But I don&#39;t ever remember seeing one with a pink landing light.  I watched as it flew overhead and noticed that there were no strobes where there should have been wings or the tail.  It was just a light with no shape that I could make out.  I also noticed that there was no sound as it flew overhead.  As it headed east towards the airport, it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were heading in a southeasterly direction silently towards the ocean at about 30 mph. They were a brilliant orange in color and were the size of a quarter at arms length.	There was approximately 1000 feet between each of the orange “balls”. There was a slight altitude difference between one “ball” and the next but the distance separating each ball was the same. They were all generally flying on the same flight path. They kept coming one after the other and we estimate between 6 and 8 of the orange “balls”. I was able to snap 2 photos but no video because of a dead battery. 	After I had called my son and wife outside and they were able to see what I was seeing, I took my son with me in the car to try to get a closer look. As we were driving we saw the last one heading towards Long Island. I got out of my car and tried to get a photo but it was too late. Before the last one was out of sight, it seemed to get 2 to 3 times brighter and then just shoot off. 				These orange balls were first sighted in my backyard in West Haven, CT and we followed them about ½ mile to the West Haven shore before they headed out towards Long Island. I watch the sky almost every night and have never seen anything like this before. My wife was actually a little upset after seeing this. It was not fireworks or planes or helicopters, I’m absolutely sure. We just want to know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My wife a 37 year old stay a home mom and I a 35 year old auto body tech and my daughters and also some people around us were watching fireworks on Laurel beach in Milford,CT. (We were not drinking alcohol). When a large round red ball that we first thought was a firework or a flare moved slowly across the sky. We were on the beach in Milford,CT and watched the object move across Long Island sound starting at West Haven beach area moving towards Long island, NY and then disappearing into thin air what seemed to be half way across long island sound. The reason I know it was not a firework or a flare is because it lasted 10-15 min. around 30 min went by and then we saw the same thing happen again almost like a recording of what we just saw. It to lasted 10-15 min before disappearing. I also know the UFO was not a aircraft because I have lived in this area my whole life and know the flight paths of aircraft between Tweed New Haven airport and Sikorsky airport in Stratford,CT. Also there were know beacons on the UFO it was just a solid red ball or an orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I heard my wife and a friend telling us What is That? and I looked up and saw an oval shaped, red thing in the air.  Definitely not an airplane, missile, or satellite. It was going 150 mph approximately which is pretty slow for something in the air. It was glowing as it headed from the South East to the West.  It was not floating, it was moving.  I have nothing to compare it to because it looked so different. I have seen fighter jets at night with their afterburners on, helicopters, commercial, private, and military planes, vintage war birds, blimps, kites, sky divers, and this was nothing like them in any way.   It was silent and it became lighter as it went along its horizontal path.  It continued in a curve, slightly changing direction and upwards at a shallow angle before it flew out of sight. The whole sighting made me feel a bit confused.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not remember it flashing but heard some of the others saying it did.<n>

It glowed orange from within, and bobbed along moving from North to South.  I pointed it out to my friend with me, and at least one other person next to me looked up and saw it to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped, held its position for a few seconds then began to rise straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappeared in about 10-seconds.

It was maintaining a constant speed, and we had time to get binoculars and observe it to be a black object with an orange leading edge. This sighting lasted approximately one minute and 45 seconds, the time it took from 90 degrees when we noticed it, until it passed over the horizon. It was a constant speed going from South to North on a path toward Coeur d&#39;Alene, Idaho. From the ground where we were sitting, the object was observed approximately 45 degrees above the eastern horizon. Amazing, no sound, and through binoculars as it approached the horizon it appeared to be a black object with the bright orange light leading it. The orange light dissipated as it neared the northern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so amazed that we didn&#39;t even think to try to get video footage or other images other than observing it through binoculars...<n> <n><n> <n><n> We can be contacted for more information if necessary.

However, it became apparent after a few seconds that this was no firework even though it had the glowing color of a yellow/orange fire because it was moving way too slowly. The movement from our vantage point first moved from right to left fairly slowly which seemed like it could have been an airplane. However, after about 30 seconds of this right to left slow movement the object was still for about 10 to 15 seconds. Then the object moved very little from left to right for a short time of around 10 seconds. Immediately thereafter, the movement started going down towards the earth in a straight line. This downward movement lasted about 15 to 20 seconds as the fire type light started to fade away in intensity. After the full downward movement of 20 seconds or so the light did indeed fade into darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my observation the best explanation I could come up with is the fire light might have been possibly an airplane which was engulfed in flames or perhaps an erratic moving missile which seems more unlikely. In any case, this could not have been a type of fancy firework considering how long it lasted and the nonlinear movement.<n>

Fireworks were going off in the distant western sky far from the 2 red pinkish glowing lights that were moving slowly from Northwest to North. I watched for a moment and realized they weren&#39;t anything I’ve seen before. We moved away from the court so that we could get out from under the overhead lights and get a better view. I&#39;m 38 and have seen planes, helicopters, flares etc. and the glow that came from these objects was unlike anything I&#39;d seen. The moon was in the opposite southeastern part of the sky. The objects seemed to move at the same speed in a straight line for a minute then hovered for approximately 20 seconds then continued moving simultaneously together. I was blocks from a camera so I decided to just watch it. After a minute and a half the light following disappeared either going suddenly beyond sight or just fading. Then another thirty seconds passed and the last one faded. The entire event lasted approximately 2 and a-half minutes. I’ve never seen a UFO or have any need to make crap up. It maybe explainable but I felt compelled to report it.<n>

It was very strange as it seemed to be stationary.  I first thought it was a normal airplane beacon light but the light was too large, I would estimate at least a diameter of 200 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my friend to watch the sky and she witnessed the light too.  After a few minutes the light stopped blinking.  We heard no air traffic or other common flying noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the sky for another 10 minutes and then witnessed a commercial passenger (??) air plane fly over the area where we saw the light.  The plane flew over without issue but gave an account as just how big the light was as the plane seemed dwarfed by the size of the light we saw.  The light did not flash over the sky nor did we see any other attributes from a normal beacon light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were approximately 8 miles from the firework show and alone at the base of a mountain.  It was very strange.<n>

Far off in the distance, there were other fireworks. I noticed a bright orange color (the color of fire), seemed to be square in shape. At first I thought it was a firework, but it kept going higher and higher and did not explode nor did the color fade. My neighbor&#39;s son said &#34;what is that?&#34; and it was quickly overhead. It was cloudy and the object was very high in the sky, however I could make out a circle pattern on the bottom of the object. I could not tell the shape. When the object was overhead, it was no longer bright orange but seemed to be almost the color and texture of a cloud. The circle pattern on the bottom seemed a soft pinkish red color. It continued on its path and was out of eyesight within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were facing north and the light was coming towards us slightly to the left side of the north, and to see the lights we needed to lift our heads up slightly in the distance the objects were coming from. When the object reached about 90 degrees to the left of its location, the object started to rise upward. As it did, I saw two more objects appear from the same point as the first one. The same thing happened. By the time the other two objects’ reach the other on, two more came out and the first object was very high in the sky and diminished. The angle we had to look at the first object was at that 90 degree angle from the way we were looking when it was closest to us. The object had seemed to rise a little below the stars and faded away.  This happened up to about ten objects. Time frame is around 15 minutes. We did no further investigation because I am skeptical and we had guest over watching the fire works. However, we believe in “anything is possible.” Today I went online to see if anyone reported this. I did find someone in Bartlett, Illinois. This town is about 10 to 15 minutes away and east of our location. He explained it in a similar way then the way it happened here. That confirmed to me that these were coming from other places. If these were homemade, I do not think the person could do this in other location that far away and have these objects follow one another. The man from Bartlett said the object got to a point where they formed in a line together. Then, I remembered looking on the internet and seeing that it has happened in other places than Illinois. I have seen similar pictures on the internet of that formation of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s sizes were almost the size of airplane lights off in a short distance. The lights, to me, glowed ever so softly, but were powerful in brightness. When I was observing how they were approaching it as though they were dangling from something, like a tiny helium balloon. However, we could not see any object connected to these lights. There were other people there is well and they saw the same thing. They may come forward, but who knows. We will try.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One last thing,  Back in the early 1980’s, my ex-husband told me that he was walking in an old area by his house and saw a hovering craft. He said he was approached and told if he said anything that he would be killed. This happened in Carpentersville Illinois in a vacant area off of route 31 in Carpentersville, Illinois. The land used to be a race track. Which is technically North of where I live now. This is all I have to offer. I do believe that there is something. Are they spying ships for the government, UFO’s? I will never say they are a hoax anymore. There is something. Thank you for your time.<n>

In the middle of the show, a bit past 21:15 we noticed a red, almost square shape high in the Northern sky above St. Louis county,  a somewhat higher altitude than airplanes that arrive into Lambert Airport, it continued to rise at a very quick pace faster than regular aircraft; a minute later in the direction of the fireworks display, the same size red square shaped craft  rose from the tree-line straight up at an unbelievable fast pace and then angled towards the other red square now hovering high in the sky. All of us on the porch witnessed it, at first a couple people thought the second one was a hot air balloon but within seconds of it rapidly rising faster into the atmosphere than even airplanes do that theory was discounted; it was clear it was not any type of balloon or regular aircraft, we lost visual contact of both crafts in the clouds as it had rained about 10 minutes prior.  Both were identical, almost square, and possibly slightly rectangular, with a very small light at one corner. Visual contact lasted about two minutes in duration.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We observed a red light in the sky that appeared to have other smaller red lights below or around it.  The red light was as large as one of the planets and was due south of us.  It also appeared to be higher in the sky than the flight path normally taken by planes flying to our local airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the two of us watched it over a period of time of about 15 minutes, we observed three things in particular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First, the light would slowly get brighter, then dim, then get brighter, then dim.  At the brightest, it was red but as bright as Venus.  At the faintest, it was still as bright as most stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Secondly, it appeared to be motionless for at least five minutes, if not longer as we first watched it.  We ruled out flares and fireworks of any kind because it was just there, not moving, just changing its brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Third, we realized that it was finally moving and appeared to be actually drifting up and to our left in an approximately 45 degree angle eastward. This took an estimated ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then disappeared before it reached where the moon was but the moon’s light was not the reason it disappeared…it just finally faded out completely.<n>

They appeared in the western sky in a triangular shape and slowly moved across the sky to the east.  They did not rise from the horizon they just appeared in the sky.  Two of the lights seemed to stay side by side.  Two of the lights disappeared and the other two continued across the sky and we lost sight as the fireworks started.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights looked to be just east of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have had other “sightings” before (3 years in a row except for last year), so this would be our 4th year. With the naked eye they look like red lights. They generally seemed to appear right as the fireworks started.  But this time as I looked up, I saw 4 red lights in a large triangular pattern and yelled to my husband “They are here now!”  I grabbed my camera (with tripod) and got some unique photos. With magnification, the red dots appear to look like some sort of worm like shape. And they moved faster than the shutter.  Then 2 of the lights just “faded out”.  I took as many as I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By 9:10: they were all gone.<n>

The four lights were well spaced apart, the second and third running an almost parallel course.  Although red,  they were luminous like Venus.  The moon was in the sky,  full and in the SE sky.  The four lights passed almost directly overhead,  never flickering.  The flightpath to nearby Gillespie Field received two incoming light planes in that time that the lights were observed.  The eastern flight path out of Lindberg Field San Diego is further south.  The lights appeared to gain a vertical altitude upon reaching a point south of the city of El Cajon.  The continued slowly tracking east,  maintaining the same luminosity.

In the East was the moon.  Then I saw what appeared to be cigar shaped object above the moon from my perspective.  It was quite far away and moving quite rapidly across the sky.  If it was a jet at the size that I witnessed it, it would not be moving that fast.  There was no vapor trail, and it was silent.  We watched it move rapidly off into the distance.  Almost immediately following that, 4 F-16s followed and appeared to give chase.  That being said, it is also July 4th and sometimes the F-16s give air shows and the F-16s remained in the area for sometime after the object left which makes me question whether or not they were actually chasing the object or not.  I could clearly hear the F-16s but not the object.  I am an aircraft owner with 950 hours of pilot-in command time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called out for the others to look and my friend yelled for everyone to stop lighting fireworks and look. We all moved toward or fence, staring to the South as the craft grew larger. It was like a rounded square shape or sphere, a beautiful reddish orange color with a single bright pulse of amber light every 2 -3 seconds. It had no anti-collision lights and did not look like any conventional craft any of us had ever seen, and it was not a firework. Two of the adults are ex-military and very familiar with military craft. They both stated that what we were watching was not a plane or helicopter or any other conventional craft. The object moved slowly, with a slow, pulsing strobe of bright gold that would flash and light the center of it.  I believe it was about 1/4 to 1/3 mile away.  It was traveling North towards us and curved gently toward the West as it disappeared in a smooth flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed that the center was darker than the rest of the ship until the light pulsed, and as it traveled, it went from a reddish color to an orange - the object appeared to be lit from inside - Like a frosted glass shade on a lamp. There were 12 adults, most of us non-drinkers, and 3 children that all watched. We had been watching fireworks in the distance to the South and were alerted by the fact that unlike the fireworks that had been going on all around the neighborhood, this object was moving horizontally, did not explode, made no sound, and made a slow arc towards the West before it got so far away we could not see it. We all felt different - confusion, amazement, and fear -A few of us were excited and almost euphoric - Feeling lucky to see it. We all discussed the object as it flew in the sky, ruling out every flying craft we could think of as we watched it. We lost sight of it when it flew out of sight.<n>

I told my friend look at that….that is different type of firework, something we both never seen.  As we both watched this ball of fire rise up almost until the human eye could not see it any more it veered off to the right and appeared to turn into a twinkling little white light almost star appearance?  The person who I was with, said “she has to look into what this new type of firework is so she could get some.   We both were mesmerized by this as we anticipated a big blast of some kind as normal fireworks displays usually have.  But to our surprise, there was no blast or load noise of any kind.  Then a few minutes later appearing in the same location across the night sky, and still before t! he fireworks display had started yet another one of these same strange appearing balls of fire started floating upward.  This one was spaced out were the last one was so it was in the same local but North from the first ball of fire?  Again, we watched this and were truly amazed by this gently floating glowing ball of something that veered off to the Right again and turned into a small looking star.  Well we forgot all about this, until we received our Shavehead Lake Wave newsletter in the mail.  Apparently, we were not the only ones who witnessed this event. As stated in the newsletter, “This year a STRANGE BALL OF FIRE moved slowly across the sky.  Was it a plane on fire?  Was it a comet? No one seems to know.”  August 6, 2011 Approx. 9PM- So here it is, 3 years later at the same above location totally forgetting this above event even took place, when myself, a friend of mine, my daughter and her friend were eagerly anticipating our fire that we were so enjoying when at the tip of the peninsula appeared to be a slow moving uprising ball of fire.  I was speechless, for a few moments and then shouted look you guys, OMG I have not seen this since a few years back on July 4th.   We were all amazed in watching this.  And again, this slow glowing ball of fire gradually moving upward until our eyes could not see it any more veered off to the South or Right and turned into what we thought a little white star or light.  Well this appeared spaced out evenly with 8 balls of fire.  You could only imagine the thrill for me to witness this event AGAIN.  Everyone I was with couldn’t wait to go home and look this up on the internet.  My friend looked up this on the net a few days later when we got home and told me! the same sightings were seen that same night…..in Michigan, by others directly East of Union, MI some 200-300 miles away ! I never told the others this, but later that night I had to walk my dog for one last time.  It was quite late already after our fire and the others were in the house getting ready for bed.  As I walked out towards the lake, I heard a very low sound and looked up above.  I said, out load to myself, OMG I hope this is not the mother ship and was very frightened to have just seen this very low, very large looking what appeared to be a plane or I didn’t even want to know cuz I was frightened and just stood in amazement as it glided over my head out into the East sky. I stood waiting to see if those red balls of fire were going to go to this thing.  But then I didn’t even want to know and went back into the house with my dog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just reporting this because last night on Coast to Coast AM- WLS-98AM Radio I caught a glimpse of your last name and want you to know about these 2 sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It had a red glow and was round.  The travel was in a straight line, the color and glow didn&#39;t very (no blinking as does an aircraft).  One person took a picture of it with a phone camera, just a red dot. If it was the size of an aircraft, it was moving much faster than a jet plane.  To compare its size to a celestial object, I&#39;d say it was about four times the size of Venus.<n>

I then ran outside to try find it in the sky from another angle but could not relocate it.

But i noticed that the star seemed too bright and close to earth for that time of the morning which was at approx. 6:30am. still walking and looking up,this &#34;star&#34; seemed to be moving. i stopped walking to observe it, it looked &#34;put&#34; or &#34;still&#34;.  i started walking again, again it seemed to be moving slowly. i stopped walking again and i could see that indeed it really was moving. Then like they alway do, it changed. It went from a simulated star to a bright light that was yellow and red in color, like the color of fire. I stood there watching it as it seemed to just scurry away. I dont know how many feet in the air it was. all i know that it was at a far enough distance for me to feel comfortable watching it.<n>

It was very high traveling from north to south  directly overhead and had no sound.  It had 2 lights, one on each wing that were not blinking and as bright as the stars around them.  The object blocked out the stars as it moved and you could just make out its silhouetted in the dark blue of the skies background.  It was elongated (Cigar shaped) with a bulge in the middle.  At arm&#39;s length it was the length of my thumb.  Just before I lost sight of it I observed it tilt up and it quickly faded into the darkness of the sky. In my opinion it was very large but I can’t give an estimate of its size or its distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 50 years old, I have been star gazing all of my life and have never seen anything like this before.<n>

Looking at the sky from the back seat through the back window, I thought I saw a meteor from the back side of the truck, but soon realized it was an aircraft because the light source was flashing in equal intervals.  I was amazed by its speed because any material subjected to that speed should have been burnt due to air friction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once my view was blocked by the truck&#39;s roof, I got up and slid the sunroof open in order to get a view.

It was a bright orange colour.  There was only 1 object and it was about the size of a large aircraft travelling at about 10,000 feet.  At first it looked like an aircraft of this description in a ball of fire.  The fire was not round in shape but more of a star shape.  The light did not change shape and it didn&#39;t twinkle or flicker like fire but did glow like fire.  There was no trail left by the light.  It was also brighter at the centre of the light as if the ‘aircraft’ was burning then the light was radiating out in the star shape.  At this stage I would not have been surprised if it had lost height and crashed but it stayed at a steady height as it travelled across the sky.  It took about 10 - 15 seconds from when I saw it to disappear into the distance.  It seemed to travel faster than an aircraft would.  If a large aircraft travels at 500 mph then I would say it was travelling 800 - 900 mph.  It was a very clear night with no clouds and it was not obscured from my view at any point.  I have never seen anything like this before and at no point did it make any sound that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like a balloon on fire but as I watched the object I realized it was nothing normal.  The object looked as if it was on fire at first but as I watched it I realized that the fire might have been in the center of it. It could have possibly had a clear shell on the outside of it.  But as I began to watch it, it started to float out into the sky at a very quick rate . Before I knew it the object was so far away and it looked like just a little star in the sky. This object floated into the sky around 500 feet away from me and had disappeared into the sky in just around 1 minute. I have never seen anything like this before. I have lived in the same house for 13 years this could have definitely been a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide little contact information.  PD))<n>

The sky had some clouds, nothing real cloudy. The object we seen was circle in shape and was flying somewhat low. Look like a fireball on top with lights on the bottom. It stopped in the sky for about a minute than started moving and picked up speed. I tried to take a picture but at that moment it took off very fast and was gone. I cant say Im a believer but I do know what we seen was not anything I have ever seen before. I few years back I seen these lights in the sky three just floated and after a few seconds they were joined by two more they moved together in the same direction as the object I seen on July 3rd. I never reported it about a year later I seen these same objects on TV I knew at that point what I seen was real and not a hoax. If you have any other reports on this object please contact me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank You<n>

As we were driving I noticed a large, orange light in the sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane or helicopter, but there were no other lights and the entire object was the same glowing orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued driving another 1/4 mile or so, watching it the whole time.  It became obvious that it was moving in a westerly direction at a fairly steady speed.  I decided to pull over and watch the object. A few seconds after doing so, it suddenly changed direction and began heading east.  My friend was able to get a picture of the object on his iPhone.  The object slowly continued east for maybe another 30 seconds while seeming to gain altitude before fizzling out of sight, possibly disappearing into a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event lasted around 2 minutes.  There were many people out shooting off fireworks that night, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were other witnesses.  The object was too high in the sky, too big, and too far away to be a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend who was with me works in the airline industry and was at a loss to explain what we saw.<n>
7/3/09 22:30|Greer|SC|Light|1.5 minutes|Bright red UFO with small white UFO that was deployed from the top.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70904.html|563|ndxe200907| Bright red UFO with small white UFO that was deployed from the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping out behind my house with my 4 year old. We live in Spartanburg county about 3 miles from the Greenville/Spartanburg Airport. We were hanging out playing video games until about 10:30pm when we decided to turn in for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was getting our blankets ready I looked up and through the mesh door of the tent which was facing to the west. Through the mesh I saw an incredibly bright red light of considerable size moving slowly over the treeline. My first thought was that it might be an airplane, but I have lived in this area my entire life and I literally see planes come and go every night. This was like nothing I had ever seen and I immediately knew that it was not a plane. I fumbled around in the dark for my video camera, unzipped the door of the tent and was able to start filming the object about 20-30 seconds after it originally caught my eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the bright red object continued slowly moving South, but then unexpectedly a much smaller white light emerged from the top and went upward at a fairly rapid pace. When the light was a good 2x higher from the ground than the red light, the red light quickly disappeared. The white light continued to stay in view and continued to move southward at a speed of perhaps 3x faster than the red light was traveling. After a bit it flickered and disappeared. When the red one disappeared, it just blinked off like a switch was flipped, but the white one flickered and faded more subtly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the entire thing on tape, and the footage of the small object emerging from the larger object is quite good. My only regret is that I zoomed in to try to get a closer look, and some of the footage is rather jerky... serves me right for always making fun of people who don&#39;t seem to be able to hold a camera still while filming a UFO. Still though, it&#39;s pretty exciting video. Here&#39;s the link to the video on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II9G-kvdzh0  I was very excited to see this. I&#39;ve kept my eyes open for stuff before when I&#39;m looking at the stars, but this was completely out of the blue and entirely unexpected. Plus, I NEVER carry my video camera with me, so the fact that my camera on hand is still amazing to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Skeptics may point out that: 1. this sighting took place very close to an airport 2. the sighting took place on July 3rd (fireworks)  Had I not seen the object myself for the duration that it was visible, and especially the emergence of the smaller white light, I too would have argued these as possibilities. However, the footage easily dismisses these arguments. It made no sound, and it moved unlike any fireworks I have ever seen. Especially the way the white light speeds up after separating from the red light. My 4 year old can be heard in the background trying to figure out what it was that we were seeing. No mention of &#34;fireworks&#34;, but he did say &#34;maybe it&#39;s a rocket ship&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, it was a blast being able to see it and film it.<n>

Of course, I say it is a UFO, not an alien because I believe it may possibly be able to be described.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not the first person to see it, but it was drawn to my attention within a minute of its appearance.  The night was semi-cloudy, and there was a haze from everyone shooting off fireworks.  There were few stars, and the moon was not a factor given the objects location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably somewhere between 1,500 and 3,000 feet off the ground, several miles west of Clinton, traveling south to north.  It appeared to put off its own light, and was roughly the color of fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thoughts were that it was a meteor that was starting to enter the atmosphere, however I quickly dropped that idea because it did not leave a tail, did not seem to be breaking apart, and was moving at a slow, steady pace at the same elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It can only be described as a glowing ball.  It did not flash or change colors, and the brightness stayed roughly the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe it was a conventional aircraft.  I grew up in the area, and it is only about 30 miles from Whiteman AFB.  This was not a typical flight path for the aircraft from that base, and it was too low to be a commercial jet.  It is possible it was a helicopter from an odd angle, but again, the speed and color make that highly unlikely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving probably somewhere around 150-300 miles per hour, as it was in the normal speeds of aircraft that I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was mostly writing because I was hoping that someone else had witnessed this as well and would be able to explain what my entire family saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
7/3/09 22:20|Murfreesboro|TN|Unknown|30 seconds|Strange light/flame over Murfreesboro, TN|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70830.html|565|ndxe200907| Strange light/flame over Murfreesboro, TN<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting out on my patio tonight, in Murfreesboro, TN, and I was up looking at the stars and planes as they fly across the sky.  I looked up, and saw what I first thought was a low flying plane going through the clouds.  The reason for this is because there seemed to be a bright light with a ring around it, like a headlight looks going through the fog.  As it got closer, I realized it that the light looked more like a flame than a light.  It&#39;s hard to describe, but it was an orange light that seemed to change shapes as it went, and changed positions.  If you can imagine a small circle, it was almost like the light was going in a circular motion, but again, changing shapes like a flame.  The next thing I thought of was a hot air balloon, but again, it was going way too fast for a hot air balloon, but that is what it looked like.  Almost like a flame flying up inside a balloon.  This object was flying lower than the clouds that were out.  I literally watched it appear in the sky above the house next to me, and then walked to the side of my house to watch it continue as it disappeared behind the tree line, which is about a mile from my house.  I sit out on my patio many nights a week, and I have never seem anything like this before.  Like I said earlier, it almost appeared to be a hot air balloon from underneath, but again, traveling about the same speed I see planes flying after taking off my Nashville International Airport.  It also appeared to fly underneath another plane that was well up in the sky, I am guessing around 25,000 - 30,000 feet.  I&#39;m not kidding, it literally flew directly underneath it.  If they were flying at the same altitude, they would have hit each other.  It appeared to fly at a level low enough, that if it were a regular single engine plane, I would have heard a noise, but I didn&#39;t hear a thing.  I was also listening to some music on my computer, turned down low so that it wouldn&#39;t have covered up any aircraft noise, and I never experienced any electrical probl! ems.  It flew on a straight path from east to west.  I didn&#39;t see anything coming out of it, or any light beams radiating from it at all.  I am guessing at the height it appeared to be at, which was around 5,000 feet, it traveled numerous miles in a matter of less than 30 seconds.  Not sure what else to say, other than I hope someone else saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It moved horizontally almost like a comet but then it came to a complete stop!  After stopping for about 20 seconds it shot up into the sky so fast and disappeared like a ballon in the sky.  About 10 minutes later it was back and there was another one right next to it and they did the same thing and followed each other after they stopped and went back up into the sky.  Absolutely phenomenal!<n>

(State Route 101) It was more over top of my view because I was now looking through power line wires and was getting a better reference as far as speed and how high it was , my best guess on speed was around 50 or 60 mph because of my vantage point following it between the power lines in my binoculars, it took some time to cross each line and then it started going into some clouds and it was becoming more difficult to follow and at this point, I went to look with my naked eye and I lost track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen various air traffic around the area before and after this, all were distinguishable airplane traffic, these other two objects were something completely different, And I would not be surprised if someone snapped a picture of this given the number people waiting for the fireworks looking at the sky directly over Clyde Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clyde is about 80 miles southeast of Toledo and 30 Miles south of Sandusky Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The time we saw this was 9:45 P.M. dusk, not quite dark enough for fireworks, the sky was mostly clear with a couple of spotty clouds, I lost view at about 9:49 P.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we looked just south of where we were standing we saw two &#34;fireballs&#34; following one another in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I did not believe what I was seeing, but there were 10-15 of us witnessing the same thing at the same time.  We are able to see both of these objects for approximately 6 minutes at which time only 1 remained visible.  They seemed to be moving west across the sky and straight up at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was probably 20 minutes later that we were able to barely distinguish an orange glow still seeming to hover very, very high above us.<n>

I quickly found the point of light with my binoculars and noticed that is was steady white with no colored or blinking lights.  I watched the light, without the binoculars, until it went out of view behind a tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be at a very high altitude, very far away and moving very fast across the sky.   I thought it might be a satellite, but I was unsure if satellites travel from south to north across the sky.  It was not a shooting star.<n>

It was viewed from Highway 25 about 2-3 miles north of Durand, WI.  While there were fireworks in the area, the objects were seen before local fireworks display.  Absolutely not planes Venus, helicopters.  Absolutely not stars.  Three separate objects were seen.  At first, these 3 light red objects were seen in a diagonal line somewhat like the “ \ “ line.  Thought initially they were one object.  Would remind one of the pattern of the Phoenix lights but only three glowing balls, stationary.  First thought was 3 radio towers but objects were too high in the sky.  Viewed for about 15 -20 minutes.  One light slowly went up until it slowly faded – duration till fade about 4-5 minutes.  After the first light went up and slowly faded, the middle light did. Finally the third light did likewise.  Absolutely not airplanes.  About 20 minutes after the last light faded a plane did fly in the general area.  Much, much different.  This location is not too far from Elm Wood, WI.  General vicinity of Plum City, maybe 13 miles away<n>

What caught my attention was the red light seemingly on the bottom of the object.  it wasn&#39;t clear like an airplane or other craft.  The read light was &#34;fuzzy&#34; to the best of my description.  As it got closer it appeared to be flying right under the clouds and the red light appeared to move location on the object.  Also, the red light was getting dimmer then went out completely as the object was overhead.  I heard no sound and the object was round and black or dark.  It seemed to be traveling at a good rate of speed, possibly a little faster than a small plane.  Like I said, it appeared to be several hundred feet in the air right below the clouds.  My wife saw it also but dismissed it as a plane.  She said that she saw the red light as it moved away towards the east.  It continued in a straight line west to east until it flew out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(Bristol, UK)<n> <n><n> <n><n> RE-POST: i am terribly sorry, the date is correct here, my computer calendar said June for some reason. i have edited the date appropriately, sorry about that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up in the early hours of the morning for a cigarette, and it was a clear sky, with a large cloud to the west. I was standing on the door step, and something caught my eye shooting past. I thought it was a bird flying low across the houses, and then maybe 3 or 4 seconds later i noticed a reflection in the sky, something going up into the atmosphere. I can still picture it exactly in my mind, and it seemed to shoot up and across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object i seen was definitely not an airplane or anything man-made, it had a circular/spherical form. and was only properly visible while the sun was reflecting off it. There were no chem-trails for the duration of the sighting (which rules out a jet, or fighter plane), although as it went &#34;up&#34; into the atmosphere, it left a blurring trail behind it which lasted for a couple of seconds, then disappearing from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The glow it gave off, maybe lights, or reflection from the sun gives me the solid impression it was metallic. I cannot think of anything man-made of which fly/moves/appears in this way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The path it took across the sky, was a straight line... at a very high speed. As it almost went behind the houses in the distance, it shot up, in an arching motion into the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot really tell what color it was, but i can say it was definitely metallic, and after browsing you-tube for similar footage to explain to my friend what i had seen. He mentioned seeing a similar metallic ball shoot across the sky a few weeks back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope this report may help towards any other possible sightings on that day, because i am still confused as to what i saw. On, a biased view, it could easily have been said that this ball/sphere was a probe/satellite of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as for skepticism i cannot find any other kind of object that matches the description of a man-made aircraft.<n>

It was a bright white light. Made no sounds at all. Traveling faster then a jet fighter. I live in Gig Harbor and I have a good view of the Eastern sky. It took approximately 8-9 minutes for it to vanish into the deep horizon. I know this was not a satellite because it was much to bright and larger then a satellite. Satellites fades out after about 20 - 25% from it being directly over head. This never really faded out, it just got further and further away until it was past the horizon. I know what a satellite looks like as well as space junk. This was neither. It was hard to distinguish size and shape as well as altitude because it was too dark. But if I had to guess, I&#39;d say it was 4-10,000 feet in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I often see aircraft on their flight path to Sea-Tac Airport but this object wasn&#39;t even in that pattern. The Tacoma/Pierce County Airport is nearby but there were no aircraft visible during this event at either Sea-Tac or Tacoma/Pierce County Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a trained observer.

I had never seen this star this bright in the location this star was in. I dont ever remember even seeing a star there before. I was smoking and decided it was just a star, but when I looked back at it again, it had dimmed a lot. And it looked to me as if there were beams of light coming from the bottom of it. This caught my attention so I watched it. It moved slightly to the right as I watched it.I thought it might have been me moving, so i tested my movement against it... I stood very still and it moved again, this time to the left. It freaked me out so now I came inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we kept driving, a tree passed in front of us which got in the way of the object, and after passing the tree where there were no other trees around, the bright circular object was gone!

After a few seconds the light slowed down considerably and then grew very bright. Once the light&#39;s brightness reached its peak, the light started moving up at a 45-55 degree angle and then the light started to dim and after a few more seconds, the light disappeared completely. I told my friend who I was on the phone with what I saw and that I couldnt believe it! Anyway, that was what happened. It was odd to say the least! And I must mention, that when it happened, it was still very light outside! There were only the two brightest stars visible in the sky. And the light that I saw was very bright and then just disappeared!  It was truly bizarre!<n>

I had the windows to my Jeep down because my air conditioner needed to be charged.  I was sober and 19 years old.  I was going to university in the city and I went to see a relative.  I left her house by myself on a very cool night.  It was breezy and balmy so having the windows down felt good. It may have stormed.  I drove my Jeep through New Albany and ended up driving north on Silver St. at around 9:00pm that night and came to the intersection of Ekin Ave.  I came to a stop and found the two red flashing “STOP” lights working as usual that night except there were more this time.  More lights. I slowed down because I was so engaged with what was rows of lights that dove so low over that intersection, after this craft slid over my head, the small one story houses and their trees ended up hiding them.  It was semi quiet and LOW. Very low.! Nobody else was around and I drove on Ekin, following in my Jeep and the craft flew over a bank of trees southeast, in front of a home no less, when I assume it headed for the river.  I couldn’t drive as fast as I’d have liked but I tried to catch up and couldn’t.  I called 911 in two counties and asked if they had gotten any calls, they had nothing and told me to call the airport.  The airport hadn’t heard or seen anything but I know what I saw.  I think I even called the news station.  They took my story but didn’t care. I made a point to exhaust all avenues but no one else saw it.  The sky at the intersection that night was dark and it was breezy.  Pulling up to the STOP became something else entirely.  These lights were bulbs (?) of some sort and they lined the bottom side of the craft.  As the craft flew over the intersection of Silver St. and Ekin Ave. its underbelly was flat with three red orbs as lights or something else?  I pulled up and noticed the craft as I stopped and s! lowed to a halt as I looked at it cross over my head and down ! Ekin Ave nue.  That is when I began trying to follow it. It was probably headed to Ft. Knox.  When I say “craft?  I assume it was all attached. It was above me and moving but the lights seemed anchored somehow.  Positioned.  There were no aircraft in the sky and if there were they wouldn&#39;t be that low.  When I called the airport I told them it flew &#34;as the low as the treetops&#34; when they said they had heard nothing.  The airway into Louisville goes over the city.

I looked up at the sky and saw what appeared to be a small metallic sphere traveling from SW to NE.  It certainly didn&#39;t seem to be far enough away to be an airplane, and I could see no definitive markings.  It wasn&#39;t traveling at a great rate of speed, and seemed pretty ordinary.  I heard no sound and there was no contrail of any sort.  I only saw it for about 10 seconds...from the time it came over the house to when it went over the trees.  I estimate it&#39;s altitude to be at least a few hundred feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

7/1/09 18:00|Mesa|AZ|Light|10 minutes|2 brilliant lights in the Mesa, Arizona sky|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71331.html|599|ndxe200907| 2 brilliant lights in the Mesa, Arizona sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving my parents home when I noticed a bright light in the west northwest part of the sky. Initially I thought it was an airplane, but after it remained in the same position for a couple minutes I realized it couldn&#39;t be. I looked for airplanes in the sky and one moved beyond this light so I definitely knew it was stationary. I called my parents on the phone and had them head out to look at it. It was after I hung up with them that I noticed a second due north. I went to take video and pictures with my phone, but neither finction worked. I had stopped on the side of the road for a better look when I heard helicopters coming from the south (Williams Air Force base) as they passed overhead the northern light went out. The light in the west northwest remained. I drove home to get my camera which is only 4 miles away. By the time I got home the light was out and I&#39;ve never seen either since. Nothing was mentioned on the news or in the newspaper after. The skies lighting had the sun set behind mountains but still light outside. Some stars visible but none nearly this brilliant.<n>

All of a sudden out of the corner of my view something irregular caught my eye. I turned to look at it, and saw what appeared to be a triangle of white dots. The sky was clear, with few clouds around. I scanned the sky for just a second or two, and by the time I returned my focus to where the object had just been, it was gone. This incident has stuck with me ever since, and even though I saw the object for just a second or two, I can still picture it perfectly in my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object as stated before was in the shape of a triangle. The three white dots were connected by faint white smoky/whispy lines which converged at the center of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the short moment that I saw the object, I didn&#39;t see it fly or move at all. It was stationary when it caught my attention, and seconds later it was just gone. After it had disappeared, I could see no smoke trails indicating where it had gone, nor did I hear any sounds indicative of a fast moving aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently saw a television program where I saw a filmed sighting of a remarkably similar object, which was filmed in California. After seeing this, I decided that I should document my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The light slowly faded away until we were able to discern that it was not a airplane, and was an oval shaped aircraft of somesort that I have never seen before.  The light continued to fade,and the craft began to look blurry, until the entire plane faded away and disappeared completely.  I was left looking all over the sky for the object, but it was gone.  It had just vanished in the middle of the sky, and it hadn&#39;t been flying at a very high altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a unknown craft moving in the sky. I watched it for about 2 minutes straight. I noticed it was staggering side to side but still proceeding forward. The lights on the unknown craft seemed normal like a flashlight, constant. When I was staring at this unknown object to the end it was light of it was dissappearing into space, I thought it was. Then 2 seconds later a flash of light appeared in that same spot to where it dissappeared. I thought to myself, could it have jumped into lightspeed. To when I thought about our atmosphere when crafts breaking into mach or light speed there is a slight chance you see light at the end making a singularity of some sort which causes the air and water molecules to disrupt. Apparently, this one broke it to where it was like the light shinned brighter than a spot light or the north star. One sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We take photographs daily to upload to our facebook profile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 1st of July 2009, sometime between 07:00-09:00 we took some photographs for this purpose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yesterday, whilst searching for a photograph I came across a photograph taken on the 1st of July which appears to have two golden triangular/spherical shapes in it.  The second one appears to have a halo surrounding it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For your information, Tofo is a remote location and we have no air traffic at all and no weather station within close proximity.  I am mystified as to what these shapes can be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A second photograph taken on the same day shows two golden blurs.  Please allow me to reiterate that it is not possible that this is a damaged lens as other photographs taken on the same day, both before and after these photograph[s] reflect no such objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would really appreciate your urgent and soonest reply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kind regards and many thanks  ((name deleted))<n>

I was with my younger brother and my two neighbors talking about how the school year went and future plans.  While in out discussion, although it was still very bright out, I witnessed a fast streak of light behind some houses.  As soon as it passed, my brother and I freaked out yelling to everyone &#34;did you see that?!&#34;  It looked as though it was a meteor but it was way too bright to be one, and it was still bright outside.  My brother and I were staring straight at that direction while everyone else was backwards to it. I was lucky to see it, but I don&#39;t know what I saw really.  It had this glow to it as if staring into a bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never reported this before, never thought of doing so, but now I am.<n>

We were on vacation in a seaside hotel. 8 adults and 4 children we were outside of the building. Suddenly kids started to scream to us to come and see what is flying in the sky. We turned north-east and we saw bright red ball to rise to the sky from the sea. Kids said that while rising two bright red pieces have separated and fallen down. We, the adults saw only the main ball. When raised in the sky, the ball changed his direction and started moving parallel with the ground. We were observing this movement about a minute while the ball was moving away and disappeared in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

7/1/09 00:00|Fort Wayne|IN|Formation|several weeks|Multiple sightings of fast moving points of light with changing motion, no identifiable shape, sudden appearances and disappearances.|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71096.html|612|ndxe200907| Multiple sightings of fast moving points of light with changing motion, no identifiable shape, sudden appearances and disappearances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Multiple sightings of unidentified objects have occurred in the past few weeks over Fort Wayne, Indiana. Sightings have been made by myself and 5 other people.  I have experience in astronomy, astrology, and physics, as do two other witnesses.  REPORT:  On clear nights the unknown objects have been seen flying across the sky as (apparently) tiny points of light--NOT BLINKING, with a constant glow--, about the size/brightness of an average star (from our perspective). At first we assumed they were planes or possibly satellites, but for how small they were--seeing as they were at extremely high altitudes--they were moving far too fast.  The objects moved at a seemingly constant velocity, but their independent trajectories are  not constant.  We have seen them travel in straight paths, in exaggerated arcs, and even move back in forth in a kind of weaving motion. What is peculiar is that the objects do not appear off the horizon, they simply appear at random points in the sky, sometimes along with barely noticeable flashes of light.  Some are stationary and then begin to move very suddenly with no detectable acceleration.  Furthermore, the objects do not necessarily fly toward the horizon as they move away from us.  Instead they either fade away or simply blip out of sight.  We assume that this means they are not following the curve of the earth, but moving on some kind of tangent.  One object was the most interesting.  It was much lower in the atmosphere then the others, appearing very large and bright, but with no obvious shape.  It was just a point of light.  It moved very quickly across the sky, and disappeared in a very sudden and almost undetectable flash of light.  It was nowhere near the horizon at the time of its disappearance.  The color of light coming from the larger object seemed to be a yellow shade, the wavelength being around 580nm. The most recent sighting was witnessed by myself alone at approximately 4:15 am, Wednesday, July 15 2009.  There was a small flash and then a poi! nt of li ght like others before.  This time, though,as the object moved directly over my position, the amplitude of the light it emitted greatly increased until it was very very bright.  It dimmed again, then brightened for a shorter amount of time, before quickly speeding up and simply disappearing at about 75 degrees off the horizon. ** I realize this report is not very well organized, but it is in all aspects completely serious.  I would very sincerely appreciate if someone were to look into this case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
