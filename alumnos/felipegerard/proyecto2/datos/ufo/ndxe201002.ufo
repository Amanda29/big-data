It was impossible for it to have been done bu a person, all probabilites have been excluded trying to figure it out. they drove off quickly and it vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had never met her friend before which made the night extremely weird. &#34;Hi nice to meet you, come check out this ufo in the sky!&#34;  My cousin, her boyfriend, and myself were standing out in the freezing cold last night smoking cigarettes and talking about life in general, when all three of us suddenly got silent and began questioning what was visually in front of us.  It was a bright white light high in the sky with six smaller lights blinking around it on both sides, six total.  There were only three other colors besides the white light in the middle.  RED BLUE GREEN, RED BLUE GREEN.  That was the pattern.  At times it would move farther away making it appear as one bright light.  Every few minutes it would begin to move around very slowly but then return to sitting still.  This took place for around two hours.  After I built up the ! self esteem to go inside and tell the others what I was witnessing thats exactly what happened.  They came outside and it only appeared to be a very bright star.  They began to laugh and give us funny looks when the light completely disappeared for three or four seconds only to reappear bright and flashing the pattern of multi-colored lights again.  We stayed outside observing for nearly three hours stunned in disbilief at what we were witnessing.  Im not saying it was a ufo I do not know what it was.  I am 22 years old and the five people with me were all between 22 and 26.  None of us have ever seen something like that before and when you witness something like that it is truly disturbing in a sense, it makes your spine tingle.  Shortly before the object went away two planes circled within the area of the object but would not get very close.  I just hate not knowing something and I really wish there was an explanation to what we witnessed.  I certainly never thought I wou! ld be sitting online typing this but i don&#39;t know what else to! do.  ho pefully others around the area saw the light also and they will hopefully talk about it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/28/10 23:00|Wexford (Ireland)||Light|5 minutes|Orange glowing objects seen in skies over Wexford, Ireland.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74503.html|3|ndxe201002| Orange glowing objects seen in skies over Wexford, Ireland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 11:00pm on 28/02/2010 I witnessed a number of bright orange lights moving from the North West tracking a South Easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just arrived home and as I got out from my car I looked up to the sky to see a large orange light.  I watched for about 20 seconds as it slowly tracked from North West in a South Easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky’s above us are on a busy flight path so I was used to seeing the flashing lights of aircraft in the sky.  What made this sighting unusual and what captured my attention was the orange colour and the fact that it was not flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night is question was a very clear night with a full moon high in the sky and to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I would get some binoculars and watch the object from the rear of my house. The rear of the house is south facing. I waited outside the rear of the house expecting to see the object.  After 10 – 15 seconds, there was no sight of the orange glowing object so I went to the side of the house to see where it might have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my amazement I saw in total three objects of the same colour, two which were slightly less intense in luminescence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I ran back into the house to get my binoculars and called my partner and two children.  We ran back through the house to the front door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the front of the house, which is north facing, two of the objects changed to a different path, rising in the sky and losing their luminescence.  The third object continued on a south easterly track.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the remaining object through binoculars for 5-10 seconds and then went through to the back of the house where again I was able to track the object on a south easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The luminescence of the object faded as it continued south easterly direction.  I did not see this as unusual as it was heading in the direction of the location of the moon, not directly at the moon!.   However, I was able to continue to track the object as it moved into a south easterly direction while losing it’s luminescence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not distinctly make out the shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was additionally so unusual was there was no sound from the object(s).  Normally as aircraft pass over head their engine noise can be heard very distinctly.  However on this occasion there was no sound what so ever.<n>

At first, when it was coming towards us, it looked like a boomerang shape. When it was in this shape, the left side of the craft had several non-blinking lights that were blue. The right side was virtually the same except the lights were red. In the middle, there were several diamond shaped white lights that also did not blink. As it passed over our heads, it seemed to be moving more slowly than a regular aircraft. Also when it passed over head, instead of a boomerang shape, it appeared to be triangular. about a second after it passed over our head,the blue lights went out. it started to turn slowly vertically while it was moving. When it was almost completely vertical i thought it seemed to be diamond shaped. I am not entirely sure because it was dark. then as soon as it came near us, it seemed to be across the sky in about five or six seconds. At t! hat point, i realized the portable video game system in my pocket had a camera and I took it out and snapped a picture. I would send the picture but I do not have an SD card to transfer the photo to my computer. But in the picture i could make out a huge diamond shaped light and a small red blinking light in the front. I thought it was very strange that the object went through so many changes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So, then I thought “ok maybe it is a comet or meteor” when suddenly what I saw it split into three white circles in a backwards “L” shape.  I was not too far from home, so I immediately called my dad and told him to go outside and face south. He saw what my boyfriend and I had seen, and then, it split into five circles. We were amazed and going crazy trying to figure out what it was. As we drove as far South as we could we noticed the five circles of light were vertically straight. Trees got in the way of my view, but when I managed to get another glimpse of it, it was horizontally straight. We saw a plane that appeared to be heading in the same direction and then it took a turn away from it. I am not sure it had to do anything with what we saw, but it seemed interesting. The five circle! s of light clustered a bit closer together and quickly faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did try to take pictures of these mysterious orbs in the sky in the duration of about ten minutes that this was going on, but my camera phone could not capture something at the distance of the lights, which I want to say was possibly twenty to thirty miles away. Relative to the size of full moon that was out at the time, I would say it was about one eighth of the size (and the moon was big and low around 1850 hours), or about three times the size of the North Star, or maybe even the size of a light bulb twenty to thirty feet away. I am sure more people had to see it if they were going south of Krome Avenue. This is not the first time I see something of this interest in the sky and I am certain that we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The meteor was falling for a much longer duration and was significantly larger that I was accustomed to seeing.  It looked like a burning fireball travelling at a high speed.  It kept falling and then split into two smaller burning fireballs and continued to fall.  Well before it hit the ground each meteor split into two orbs or lights (thus four total) and each light turned and travelled horizontal to the ground.  They were no longer falling.  We then noticed a fifth and all five were travelling at different speeds to the west.  We watched them fly for several minutes until they got so far we could no longer see them.  They did not fly in any formation and appeared to be travelling at different speeds and altitudes.  Next we noticed a second fireball that did the exact same thing.  There were 10 orbs or lights total travelling in two groups of f! ive towards the west.  We watched them for about 5 minutes.  The lights were white with no color.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thought it was a plane on fire crashing. Then before it hit the ground, it seperated into 4-5 objects and flew in different directions and different angles but relatively horizontal.  Objects looked to be moving at different speeds until we could no longer see them.  This occured in homestead florida, near homestead airforce base. Unless this was a military exercise or an air show, I have no other explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He described it as being a large white light in the sky just above a telephone pole to the north of our house.  The light looked much like a regular star in the sky but much more prominent than the other stars.  When my father viewed the light through a pair of binoculars, it appeared to be a light composed of about 7 to 9 smaller lights.  To the left of this large light was another smaller light.  Suddenly, the light started to move up and toward the south, right over our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was the only thing that could be seen throughout this entire ordeal.  No craft could be completely seen through this light.  As the light moved toward our house, it moved with the speed of a regular airplane.  It was also noted that 2 small lights were blinking under the main light, in sequential order.  After the light moved over our house it continued traveling south until in could no longer be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My view was from a high position over looking Lake Travis and the hills around it. The shape was circular, although, it had the effect of appearing to be two lights/circles contained in one &#34;craft&#34;. But what was clear was that it was a deep flaming color that didn&#39;t indicate any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen, but possibly a satellite, though it would be very large if one. I watched as the light pulsed from dim to bright at a slow pace. After a few minutes it went dim to darkness.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It may have been the first weekend in March.)  Very clear, quiet winter night at the beach. Cold. The ocean was very calm. I&#39;d gone out to a dunes crosswalk to look at the ocean before going to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked south down the beach and noticed three large glowing white lights. One of them was about 45 degrees up from the horizon just east over the surf. Another was the same height, but more directly south over the beach, and the third one was the same height and much further west as if over the marsh. If I stretched my arm out in front of my face, they were about the size of my fingertip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They caught my attention because they were still.  They didn&#39;t move in the sky at all. They did fluoresce somewhat which may have been an atmospheric effect. It seemed like they were &#39;shining&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were flares, but they were so high up and, as I watched, they did not fade.  This area is a flight path for commercial airlines going up and down the east coast. The jets usually fly quite high in the sky. I did see a few jet lights passing far up overhead. These unusual lights stood out because they were closer, far larger, silent, and did not move. I went out the next day and looked around to see if there were any large light poles that might have accounted for this.  There were none.  I&#39;ve been going to this beach for 50 years and have never seen anything like this.<n>

Firstly, it was not a dot of light.  It seemed larger, and palely lit.  It was circular.  It went up like a flare, and behaved very much like that, however, this was clearly not &#34;Fire.&#34;  It was just a pale round lit up object.  What happened next was what was strange.  It shot off away from me and across the horizon like a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m hoping someone else saw this, and had a better look at it.  I’m guessing there is a normal explanation for it, but the last time I saw something like this was a large meteor, and it was clearly just that, and had pieces of it coming of in the tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This behaved in a similar manner, but with no tail, or fire-like characteristics whatsoever.  I only saw it for seconds, but it seems like it went up, then off in a different direction.  Very strange.<n>

The first was when I was studying in Bangalore, India, in 2001. This is the second one and occurred about a week ago at my current location, Hyderabad, India.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the terrace of our place resting on an arm-chair. The only reason I was even looking up at the sky was because of the angle at which the armchair reclined. I noticed a bright light in the western horizon, and as it was still twilight the object was the only ‘star’ I saw in the sky.  Even as I watched , it suddenly seemed to grow in size and intensity, moved ‘up’ in a way that I cannot really put into words (a sort of beaming, if you will) for a little distance at normal speed, then disappeared abruptly. I tried to figure out what it could have been, but so far no logical explanation has seemed good enough, to me. What I saw was bizarre behavior, I am absolutely sure that this-like the first sighting I had had years ago-was no aircraft or a weather balloon of any kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I my self have been questioned years ago for statements I made while in the Army Reserves while on active duty, as I followed and read Operation Blue Book material and made some quotes about an aircraft that crashed in upstate New York in the late 1970&#39;s. I have also seen things like advanced lazer technology with Huges Aircraft that would scare many people today! What I have come to understand is really simple. People do see things they can not explain or identify. But remember the F-117 first flew in 1969. The stealth single wing bomber around the same time. The F-71 Blackbird before that! Please tell me we haven&#39;t made any advancement in aircraft in nearly 40 years? I&#39;m fully convinced of UFO&#39;s but of our advanced military. Are you seriously going to tell me, that people or beings flew lightyears accross the universe to put graffiti in our corn fields, but did&#39;t have enough intell! igents to leave a post card, or hack our primative internet to say &#34;What&#39;s Up?&#34; Or &#34;See Me, Feel Me Dude?&#34; Don&#39;t want to get to sarcastic, but please try a tiny bit of common sense. If NASA has already admitted in their park to flying 15 times the speed of sound 30 years ago, where do you think we are now? Think about computers, and cellphones and where they&#39;ve come in 30 years. Hope you at least respond. I do not rule the possibility out completely, but at best it&#39;s a 1% or less shot. Mostly they wouldn&#39;t do graffiti.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

As I got out of my car I was looking at the Eastern part of the sky, which is very open from my driveway and this night was particularly clear. I instantly spotted two faint glowing orange lights off in the distance out of the Northeastern part of the sky that were headed South. The two objects, which had what I would describe as a fiery glow, were moving in formation, with one apparently leading the other and at a slightly higher altitude in the sky from my vantage point. The objects were traveling at a steady pace and appeared to float across the sky. I could not make out any sound coming from the objects, and to my knowledge they did not make any noise. I ran in to my front yard to try and track the two objects as they glided across the sky and disappeared behind my neighbors house. I ran to my side yard and around the back of my neighbors house, but the objects had vanished. T! he event was very brief but profound, I would have given anything to have had someone there with me to witness what I saw. This event felt like I was witnessing something that I could not possibly explain, which made the hair stand up all over my neck and arms. I have recently taken a more keen look at the sky as I am currently enrolled in an astronomy class at the University of Kansas, and I have to say that witnessing these two objects was easily the most intriguing, confusing, and spookiest thing I have witnessed to date.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was relaxing and looking into the clear western sky where the consolation of Orion could be clearly observed.  At the bottom of my garden is a nursing home and appearing over the roof of the nursing home was a orange flickering light, as I observed this light I could tell immediatly that it was rotating. I called my wife who was inside, to come outside to witness this with me.  The craft we observed had lights rotating around it and was saucer shaped, as it came over the top of us I was transfixed on the base of the craft which was silvery blue in colour and the whole base was rotating - anti-clockwise with the orange lights above.  The craft continued over my house.  To observe this further my wife and I went through the house and out of the front of our property.  Once out on our front lawn we could no longer see the object in the night sky anywhere.  I recall feeling rather c! alm rather than excited but amazed by what we had just saw.  I went back inside my prperty and checked the time with the clock and still have no idea why!  I cannot stress enough that this was a mechanical craft, no noise I could hear, flying I would estimate 3-4,000 feet and the  size of a chopper. (unless it was higher in the sky than I estimate, then it would be larger!)<n>

Midway between the Napa River and Sonoma Creek when we saw a craft standing in a salt pond.  We had just passed the area in which the craft was aproximately 30 minutes prior and the craft was not there when we passed by the location. We were aproximately 4tenths of a mile from it. It stood aproximately 50 ft. high and 40 ft. wide.  It had what I call legs extending out from the sides aproximately 3 ft. from the body of the craft starting aprox.10 ft. from the top to the bottom. We couldn&#39;t see the bottom because it was on the other side of the levy. We were amazed and starred at it for a few minutes. We talked about a camera. We had problems with the boat motor as it failed to start.  Somehow we lossed our memory of what happened from the time we saw the craft to the time we were back at the Hudeman slough boat ramp.  We would have seen it as we passed by the spot at the levy when we headed back to the ramp.  My brother and I both feel as if an energy source could have taken our concentration etc and over powered us after we seen the craft. We haven&#39;t talked about this to anybody since as we both agree people will say we are crazy, were on drugs or some other comments.  After I listenen to coast to coast on the am channel the other morning, I thought I would share this sighting.  I have a very hard time believing that we were the only ones who saw this craft. It stood out in an area with no trees, buildings or structures at all in the area.  I have never seen a craft similar to this in my life other than one on a science fiction movie maby.  We are very curious as to wether or not a similar report has been made.  If you have indeed received a similar report of a similar object I would appreciate you getting back to me.<n>

Time was exactly 5:55 am, when I first saw this, total time was about 4 to 5 minutes.  Traffic on turnpike was all slowing down as a result of whatever this was.  I am n! ot a follower of ufo&#39;s and have never reported anything like this before, but feel whatever this was, it was not normal to say the least, and very vivid will it be in my imagination for a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am walking home from work and looking up at the stars as I usually do as it is dark when I finish work.  I use a head mounted light intensifier to aide in my walking. This light intensifier magnifies the stars and makes even the most dullest of them bright. The weird thing is of this is that I noticed that one of the stars was moving, so I dismissed it as a plane, but it started moving in the opposite direction so suddenly. I removed my head mounted gear and gazed upon this light which to the naked eye appeared to be an orangey colour in the shape of a three pointed equilateral triangle but the sides were not straight, they curved to the three points. It was a bright light that moved west-east then back and then moving back again west-east it then started to get smaller as if it were moving away. It did not however move away across the sky when it got smaller its positio! n was fixed and it got smaller and smaller until in a little puff of orange light it disappeared and even with my intensifier it was not there anymore, there was no sky bound movement at all. This lasted in total for about two minutes but is still to me the most prominent evidence that we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I looked up in the sky and saw what appeared to be two bright stars.  I stayed out longer than usual and had a second cigarette when I noticed, what I thought to be stars, were now moving slowly in all different directions.  I went back inside studied for another hour and went back out to the balcony to have another cigarette once again I noticed the two bright lights in different locations but still moving slowly in all different directions and at times they would suddenly stop and stay in one position for a few minutes and start moving slowly again.  This continued until 4 AM and then they suddenly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has continued at least 2-3 times a week from February to present day July 31, 2010 around midnight again.  I woke my husband one night at 2 AM on another night I was studying, because he didn&#39;t believe me and said that I had gone mad from all the studying and he witnessed one of the starlike objects moving around.  He didn&#39;t know what to make of it and then proceeded to tell me not to wake him up again.  I&#39;m very fascinated by this and wondered could they be satellites and went online tonight to do some research after six months of witnessing these things in the sky and found out I&#39;m not the only one seeing these lights.  I can&#39;t wait to show my husband!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was between 8pm and 8:10 pm.Looking South,  I noticed a series of high altitude very bright lights in the dark sky.  I passed a car parked on the roadway that seemed to be watching the lights also. The lights dimmed and went dark. There were no aircraft in the sky that i could see or aircraft lights to indicate it was a plane or helicopter. Then a whole series of lights came on and covered a large area.They came on all at once and dimmed and went out independantly.  If there was any movement of the lights it wasnt much.Not like a meteor or space junk entering the atmosphere. The lights were not colored just white and bright.All the lights went out. Then after 30 seconds 3 came back on.I shined my spotlight in the direction of the lights. The lights dimmed and went out and again there were no signs of aircraft lights. There were several cars on the hiway and you could not help but to notice the occu! rance.<n>

There was nothing attached to it, nor were there any lights around it and it was the only one I saw, it was about maybe 3 feet wide and 4 feet tall if I were to guess.<n>

Starting with my last sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 02/24/2010.At 1330 while driving on Interstate 8 going west, we were about 30 miles out of Gila Bend, I was traveling with my fiancé,  I had told her on one occasion I had seen a UFO on this same stretch of road, back in 2002, It was a relatively clear sky , as I remarked that we were getting close to the location of my first sighting on this road, I told her that just north  in the foot hill’s is where it was, so she looked and  remarked in a hushed voice, “ Yea I see it”, and so I looked harder and there it was, a  bright white ball of light, it looked to be on the far side of the hill’s to the north, 15-20 miles away. I was driving around 75 mph. It remained visible  out the side window  “as if traveling in pace with us” this could just be a trick of distance, but  it remained visible to us while we stopped in Yuma for a snack,  and on till we passed El Centro Ca.  It never changed its Altitude or distance, to any extent visible to us, but did remain out the passenger window till about 1600, and we were going into the foothills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first time I had this happen on this road was 8 or 9 years ago in November, and I was going East, My first sight of it was around 10:00 the sun was on my right the object was North by North East I was just going into the curves that drop you out of the foothills, my guess at that time was it was 50 miles away, I watched it as I was traveling on my motorcycle, I stopped for gas 2 times and it remained steadily visible till I was almost to Phoenix, that sighting lasted for over 4 hours, it “shrunk into the distance N.xNe.”<n>

After that I came inside and uploaded the pics onto my computer and was amazed to find several round sphere’s a long ways up over my House. So, I zoomed in the pic and there was this disc looking sphere, greenish on the center and fuzzy white around the outside. It also appeared to have area’s of exhaust coming from several spots around the orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following night December 26, 2009, I took about 50 or 60 more pics and was again surprised to see many more of these round muti-colored orbs. There appeared to be human-like occupants inside the craft, I could tell because these things are transparent. Today is March 7,2010 , every single night since then I have seen MANY different size and shaped crafts, several of them appear to be VERY large. In the photo’s you can see people inside, also what appears to be computer terminals and flat screens, with people sitting or standing around them. Also, you can see what looks to be  ( plasma warp drive’s) or something. I have seen these on clear nights, cloudy night s, in the rain, in the snow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One time I was observing a couple of them hovering way up overhead, and it seemed as soon as I took a picture and my flash went off, they took off, it looked like a shooting star, it took off so fast, my brother happened to be standing outside with me during one of these events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can go outside on any given night and capture these things on camera, sometimes I have to take a couple pics, then its as though the flash attracts them and then there’s anywhere from 1 - 20,30 of them. I have many pictures, I haven’t really wanted to report them because there is such a stigma attached to this topic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I’ve seen, I have proof on film, and they’re not blurry images, you can clearly see thses things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I take several photo’s in a row , pointing at the same spot, they are never in the same spot, they are definitely moving. And there is like a roaring sound like multiple jets flying in circles, and then sometimes, no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They are very beautiful crafts, and super fast. My wife has seen the pictures, but doesn’t care, she tells me I’m losing it, even though she can clearly see the pictures. She’s the type of person that ( just wants to live her life) and doesn’t want to be bothered with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tell her she needs to pay attention, we don’t know what these things are capable of , where they’re from, Are they extra-terrestrial, or Secret Machines made by our very own Government. That’s another reason I have taken so long to report them, I don’t need no trouble from no Government Agency, or Black Op Project  messing with me and my Family. I will share the photos with you. But I wish to remain anonymous.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/24/10 04:30|Arden|AR|Formation|20 minutes|Without knowing I disturbed the same lighted aircraft that my family and I have seen 24 years ago in the same area as before.|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74473.html|37|ndxe201002| Without knowing I disturbed the same lighted aircraft that my family and I have seen 24 years ago in the same area as before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the year of &#39;86 my family and I saw a very huge lighted aircraft hovering above highway 32 west of Ashdown. It was during the school year almost at dusk. The remaining daylight showed what I remember as a huge craft that looked like what I seen off of Star Wars. It was going as slow as we were, almost as it was floating. it stayed with us until the turn off of Old Richmond Road. It was like it was using the road also. I remember yelling to my Father to follow it. He looked as he seen a ghost as my Mother told him no. Other cars and trucks were driving fast to follow. I remember that like it was yesterday. It was posted in the Little River News and also aired on the local 10 o&#39;clock News. Stories were told for a long time until suddenly falling silent. The morning of 2/24/10 I just left Texarkana, AR from shopping late night I felt like riding some old back roads and listen to my newly installed sound system that is very loud. I did not want to disturb the! working class town folk, because I know how it feels to wake up to loud music on a work day. I cut down the road that leads behind our paper mill, Domtar. It is just a little North of the town Ogden, AR. I hate to admit this, but I got a little lost down further I drove. It has been years since I have driven that route. I got turned around several times and seemed like i went around in circles. I knew what community I was in just not were exactly i was. A while after driving very slow on the gravel road I felt like I was being followed. That is because I have noticed a light that seems to stay the same distance behind me when I travel down Highway 32 going East towards Asdown. It always originate around my parents home community of Arden. It seems not only to follow me from there on that road but stays a good distance behind me on every road I take leaving from that area. I have driven out to the wooded area called Gum Flats, which is a very wooded area that covers a lot o! f land from Foreman, Ar to Wilton and Ashdown, AR to see if I ! could ca tch a show like i did when I was 9 years old. I did not think to try crossing Highway 32 and covering the South part of the area. It is very different almost like a marsh like swamp land with its fair share of large remote and hard to get places. This stretch of land is between Ashdown and Foreman is covered with crops and cattle farms. A very large if not more is very remote and has lots of wildlife including lots of water beds and creeks that leads for miles. When some of it felt familiar I got fed up and started to feel like I should stop these kids or so called buddies from playing these jokes on me. I have only been without a job for a month but i started to ride the old back roads again a lot to ease my mind and plan my future. I figured my friends was doing a little joke to keep me on my toes. I guess I was wrong, when I cut down a narrow road and turned around very quickly, it was almost a little bigger than one lane. Being far enough down the road that had a fence r! oad on both sides, I should have caught a glimpse of the back end of any vehicle if it had turned around like I did. I drove very fast to catch them but did not see or hear any sign of a vehicle or people present. I knew that there had to be something following me because when i went down a long straight road that had a street light at where i started the road that left a perfect light on the road i saw on down a shadow that broke the light and moved a little left and right. With no trees to do this and still being straight I new they were behind me fixing to fool around again. I never heard a sound when I stopped and killed the engine no gravel crunch, no sudden stop and slide that is when I realized I told no one that I was there. Feeling like a fool i started back on the road and saw a shadow in the distance like a house or barn with a yard and cars. As I got closer I saw a reflection of a dull metal gleam from my headlights. It was like a normal reflection off a metal b! uilding but shinier and the shine seamed to go away and come b! ack. I t hought I lost my mind and should call a local friend to help me get home so i could get to bed. When I got close to the house it had a dull brown or tan color that could not have any kind of reflection. In middle of that what i thought would be me mentally breaking down finally going mad like my girlfriend has been accusing me of being when I told my Lighted Jokes Following story, I realized I knew the bridge I was driving upon.I took the side road that is numbered County Road 9, which I have been on many times also have a few friends that live on and near the rough road. Feeling frisky and Awaken I turned my Stereo full blast on the best song I cold find on my Flash drive that had the loudest base also when this flash drive is in my player it has a bright flashing blue light that is random flashes. Grabbing the New L.E.D. flash light I bought earlier I turned it on and shined it out side in many directions randomly and switching directions very quickly. I also was driving n! ot straight but from one side to the next staying kind of centered on the road, like i was bouncing from one ditch to the other. Slowly getting closer to the houses that live closer to the highway 32 which this road leads I came around a curve that is not sharp 2 lights flashed on almost like the flash light i played with and the flash drive that was flashing. My first thought was I was seen acting a fool on the road by our local Wildlife Officers of the Law making sure our wildlife friends was not being harmed by poachers out of season (great job fellas!) After seeing two I noticed they were getting brighter, when all of a sudden 8 to nine more flashed on creating a shape that looked a lot like I have seen before but did not grasp at the moment. I still blamed my good buddy for taking a joke to far, so I went toward the lights thinking they where in a tree stationed waiting on me. It was not to far away when i saw no tree and this Huge U.F.O. floating above me it was like ! a stealth camo it was dressed in because all i could see was t! he brigh t lights and what looked like its paint or body of the vehicle was bending light so it looked like the sky around it. when I stopped the car and turned off the radio it also stop approaching me it was huge like a large non perfect oval hole in sky with lights. I wanted to get as close as I could to touch it, when I drove a few more feet the lights went out and I still saw it there like it was trying to hide with the camo paint job that reminds me of the movie Predator, where I still saw its shape but it tried to blend in the sky. I saw it glide slowly to the field to the right and what I thought land, without having a great light I could not say for sure. I stopped and started to get out so I can see what I can learn about this thing that haunts me. Without emotions or feelings I was full of a urge to finish this 24 years of wonder. Then thought to myself what if something happens to me no one would know because I did not inform any one about me being lost and driving all ov! er these back roads. I sadly left and went down to my friends with a thought of finding out what that is if I even have to walk for days in the marsh, camping and getting cold, wet, and finding out why it messes with me. Maybe I am at the right places at the wrong times and they feel threatened by me. First question my buddy got was if he was involved. He looked like he got pale and told me no, and if I remember one night about 4 or 5 months back when me and my brother visited we went to a old property and he saw lights above the trees move around and we did not listen or look cause we thought he was playing. &#34;well same lights&#34; he said and seen them off and on around the same place. The way he talked with his tone I did believe him. Next day i rode with him and my brother to my cousin&#39;s house to get a stove. I only would go if I could see this road in daylight. He drove faster than I liked, but I saw the grand scale of how much wet lands I would have to cover to end this my! stery. Moving the stove I fooling around told my cousin I know! you are involved. he said &#34;for what&#34;. I said Causing the lights to flash in front of my car. He got scared and was loudly say those things are for real many times and said it was about midnight the night I saw them when he was scared by them back in the house and went to bed thinking he was seeing things.      I do not believe in the other worldly aliens. I like Sci-Fi but outer space beings do not make me think they came to earth for deserts, swamps, and cattle to probe. I have seen many aircraft flights that were over my parents home were we lived since I was in 2nd grade. They have been large and small copters with many jet engine aircraft making the same path over the house. I was even Nearly Knocked off my feet by a Bomber I think was a F-1 it was big and very loud it flew right above the ground at tree top level. With many bases around and lots of remote land that maybe no one can reach. Our Military Force may have a very quiet stealth machine that has new camo like armor and! super flight abilities. I would like to know why we have not seen one in combat it seems like the tech has not changed since i seen 25 years ago or that of what I researched. the lights from the early 50s is the same shape and size. I know i am not the only one to see this ship. I am not scared to tell my story, because I want to put it out in the open and I will find this thing or many things if it is one of many that breaks off from a larger ship to do test runs in isolated areas using its stealth shell and flight controls to see if it can be spotted by civilians who drive or live in these areas. Also my vehicle did not get shut down by e.m.p. at the time we were face off, but the day after my electrical systems started to act up. first my radio was reset of all my settings like the battery was unhooked or reset. my electric windows and locks did not work also my transmition will not go in gear. When I checked engine over my battery was leaking acid like it exploded from! a short. I now am without a ride so I am even more ready to f! ind this thing and face it to find my answers as well as what other would like to know.  If any person like my self know any more info that will lead to the closure of this mystery please help and tell of your encounters.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to hover for a moment, then it drew closer.  Then it pulled back began to switch back and forth in the sky at an amazing speed not capable of any conventionally, human-made aircraft.  We watched it for several seconds weave back and forth (east to west) in a &#34;Z&#34; pattern in the sky, then it zoomed in again for another moment then quickly zoomed out and flew to the north out of visibility at an amazing speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there for several seconds trying to process what we had just witnessed.  I said to my friend, &#34;did you just see that?&#34; and she replied &#34;yes, did you?&#34;.  Neither of us could come up with a rational explanation for it.<n>

They started out really high, I thought it was helicopters at first but then they started to dive and do maneuvers I have never seen.  One got so low I could see it was triangular shaped and glowing an almost unnatural purplish blue and the other looked very orb like and blue.  We are not the only people who saw them, a whole line of cars followed us to where the low one was flying but when we got there everything was gone, and we were there within a minute.

An object flew like an aircraft only inches above water. The duration was few seconds (10-15) only as it was so fast and close to where we were standing.It was shaped like a Disc but hazy i.e. not a solid object. It could not be a ferry, speedboat, shadow of a plane, water wave, water current or my Imagination - Because my friend said what the F was that. I looked up to look for a plane, but anyone in NYC knows it has been gray &amp; cloudy eliminating any light source, no boat could flew by without obvious appearance or without water trail, waves etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an amazing experience, I don&#39;t know what it was but it was an Un-Identified object for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i am pretty educated and scientific person, and would not believe anything until I would see anything with my own fair eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was something.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Within 5 minutes drive from Marshall we both suddenly noticed a bright, green light or orb in the sky, slightly above and in front of us. It appeared to be stationary and wasn&#39;t very big but within seconds it seemed to grow as if getting closer and/or brighter. We were both in awe, as this was not by any means normal. It was about 1.5 to 2 times the size and brightness of the moon that night. Not 2 seconds after it appeared to move closer, it took off. The large, green orb displayed streaks of orange light as it moved from the top corner of the driver-side of the windshield up into the sky and completely out of sight in the blink of an eye, with the movement resembling an upward swoop. The whole experience lasted about 6-15 seconds or so but I have never, ever seen anything like that in my life.  I am convinced that it was not of this! world, simply because it was so bright, moved with such speed, and even more so the way it moved. A hook-shape if you will, where, when it was stationary, it was resting at the end or barb of the hook and once moving, quickly swooped down then back up and was gone. That about sums it up though. Hope you enjoy the report. I definitely enjoyed observing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then all of a sudden more came by from all directions. Mostly north to south and south to north. Alsofrom north to south tuning to the west. Then we turned to the west and saw some coming from north to south and south to north. MY husband saw a total of 10 then went in the house cause he was cold. I stayed out for about 5 more minutes and saw 2 more coming from the north to south. A total of 12. Then instantly I saw a luminous white v shaped object swope in front of me towards the north. It swooped from the north and turned and swooped to the east and up and out towards the north . Then I saw the last small round white object follow in the same direction. So there was 12 small white objects and the larger  luminous v shaped object. I then saw no more and went in the house around 7:30 p.m. It was just amazing!!!<n>

As we parked our vehicle in our driveway and stepped out we both noticed an extraordinarily large bright light in the sky just below the cloud ceiling.  The size of the UFO/light in relation to distance in the sky was larger than several passenger airplanes combined.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were facing due south and we looked up – it was approximately at 120 degrees angle (if 90 degrees is zenith).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was already moving extremely quick, far faster than any airplane.  The best description of how bright the light was relates to the science experiments done in school when burning magnesium.  This light was not a flare, was consistently bright, did not have a chemical trail and left no sound/wake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we noticed the single, very large, bright light, it took approximately 1.5 seconds and it moved due south at a high velocity.  Within that 1.5 seconds it had moved from our position we noted to a point in the horizon we could no longer see – it had in essence disappeared.  The best description of the velocity is similar to watching either star wars or star trek when the ship moves to hyperdrive/warp speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yet, there was no sonic boom typical of high velocity aircraft.

2/20/10 13:47|Clearwater|FL|Triangle|12 minutes|5 UFO's in broad daylight sighting.|7/11/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/111/S111360.html|58|ndxe201002| 5 UFO&#39;s in broad daylight sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was jogging on a popular trail and all the sudden I see a blinding red flash up in the sky in front of me.  Somewhat startled I stopped and looked up.  About 300 yards in front of me and a short distance above the trees was a giant white triangle shaped aircraft surrounded by 3 &#34;balls of light&#34;.  Best way I can describe them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I first looked up, I had the strangest sensation I&#39;ve ever had. I didn&#39;t think they were UFO&#39;s, I just had no idea what I was looking at.  I could almost feel my brain trying to figure it all out. Then I finally realized what it was I was looking at.  The Triangle aircraft was about 3 passenger airplanes in length and maybe 5 stories high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Triangle aircraft had 2 large red lights in the back and one white light in the front. The 3 lights took up almost the entire bottom of the aircraft.  The red light was blinding bright and gradually dimmed out.  As it dimmed out the 2nd red light came on and again got to be blinding before dimming out.  The white light then proceeded to follow the same pattern and just repeated this sequence the entire 12 mins.  The lights also were not coming from light bulbs. It was much brighter than anything like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the rear of the Triangle were 2 balls of light and 1 to the front.  Oddly they  were in a triangle pattern.  I could tell they were made of metal but much too bright to make out a shape.  The Triangle itself had some sort of distortion around the top or it wasn&#39;t made of metal if that makes any sense.  I can only compare it to a cloud that appeared to be bubbling.  All the aircraft were silent.  I heard absolutely no sound and that includes the sound around me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now for the strange part. I was on a jogging trail and I remember a man on a bicycle ride past me.  I looked over at him to ask him to stop and look at this.  I at this time looked over and it appeared as if I was about 3 or 4 feet in the air even though I wasn&#39;t.  The bicyclist also appeared to be moving very slow.  I wanted to say something to him and it seemed like he was a million miles away.  The whole thing still creeps me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I&#39;m standing there and a second Triangle aircraft literally appears out of the thin air and flashed all 3 of its lights and then vanished.  It didn&#39;t fly away it seriously just was gone.  It too had the same lights, it was an identical aircraft.  It then again appeared and then vanished and that was the last I saw of that one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it vanished, I looked back and the 3 balls of light that were there were now gone too. At this time the first Triangle aircraft started to rise very slowly and just kept going and going and going.  I could still see its lights rotating in sequence when it was VERY high in the atmosphere.  It was the first time I realized how high the sky actually is.  I&#39;ve seen some airplanes real high in the air and this thing was twice as far.  I eventually lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then looked down finally and there about 100 yards in front of me were to Police Officers staring right at me.  I do not know how long they were there or if they saw what I did.  For all I know someone called the Police on the guy standing in the middle of a running trail looking up.  I decided to just quickly leave the area and jogged away.  I have went back to that spot every year since at the same time and have never saw them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record I have no clue if it was Alien or Military.  I&#39;m not far from a very famous Military Base.  What I do know is there are aircraft capable of either turning invisible or vanishing to some other place.  Out of the 5 total UFO&#39;s I saw, only 1 flew away.<n>
2/20/10 12:00|Randsburg|CA|Teardrop|3 minutes|Unknown object flying at unusual pattern|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74488.html|59|ndxe201002| Unknown object flying at unusual pattern<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Saturday, Feb 20, 2010 about 12 noon when my friend and I were out mining in the area of Randsburg, California.  I was driving down the road and I looked to my left and saw what I thought at first was a helicopter.  It was silver and blue and it was traveling along the bottom of the mountain right to left.  My friend and I both thought it was working around a mineshaft.  We pulled over because something didn’t look right.  At closer inspection it looked like three blocks one silver on top, and two blue on the bottom and about the size of a car.  I definitely no longer thought it was a helicopter.  The wind was blowing about 30 mph from our left to right.  We got the camera and took some pictures of the object.  The object then made a right turn and went diagonal up the mountain from left to right and when it got to the top of the mountain it went straight up and disappeared . It was hard to believe we saw something do what it did.  We talked about thi! s on our way home and we remembered that we saw a fighter jet the day before flying around, although we don&#39;t know if that is significant or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We parked on one of the cemetery roads and my boyfriend says “look at those helicopters”  We got out of the car to see what we thought were five helicopters flying up and at an angle in the sky.  Almost at the same time we realized they all looked like they were on fire.  I pulled out my camera and video taped it immediately.  When we cam home I googled what UFO sightings look like because we weren’t sure.  The first video we pulled up was the same exact thing we had seen but it was in Scotland two nights prior.  I would really like to know what it is we saw. I dont know how to send the video it is too large.  We have proof.

It appeared to be coming towards us but then as it seemed to be getting closer it changed direction and veered towards the horizon, climbing into the sky until it faded out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my husband what he thought and he agreed with me, it looked like a fireball, the flames very clearly visible. There were no other lights surrounding it, no noise and as many airports operate in this area, planes are easily distinguishable from this.  This was a definite ball of light and as said, flames inside visible to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are not sure whether it was some jet engined aircraft or an actual fireball.  But the beach this night was very busy with people and this was simply too big to miss, so we are just waiting to see if others report it.<n>

2/19/10 19:55|Frankfort|IL|Triangle|15 - 20 minutes|Multiple Crafts (7-8) - 3 Super Bright White Spot Lights w/Shooting/Flickering|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74432.html|63|ndxe201002| Multiple Crafts (7-8) - 3 Super Bright White Spot Lights w/Shooting/Flickering<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling in a car, for the entire duration of our trip, we witnessed a super bright white light in the sky.  I was curious as to what it was since it was not moving, but standing completely still in mid-air, too high in the sky to be a cell phone tower.  As we proceeded to get closer, the light, we noticed, was actually 2 spot lights.  At that point we thought it was a plane, the lights being the 2 wing lights.  I began to notice a &#34;shooting&#34; type light, flickering from side to side, from one white light to the other.  I know that a plane&#39;s wing lights flicker, but they don&#39;t shoot across the plane&#39;s wings!  At this point, I was sure it was an alien craft.  I kept my eye on this thing the whole trip, and as we came to the stop light, we were directly beneath it, as it hadn&#39;t moved the entire time we were driving.  I actually rolled the window down and looked up into the sky to witness yet another light, which formed a perfect triangle with the other 2 light! s, and was sitting still in the sky as of yet.  I said to my friend, &#34;This is a UFO, an alien craft!&#34;  As I said this, the craft then (after 15 minutes of keeping my eye on it) began to move slowly with the wide end of the triangle as the front of the craft, shooting lights and all, and headed south toward the Monee/Peotone area.  I took my eyes off of the craft and then immediately noticed 6 or 7 more identical lights in the sky around the Frankfort/Mokena/Tinly Park area.  They were the same color, brightness, and height as the previously seen craft.  They looked just like the first one before I was close enough to see the shooting light.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I actually saw something very strange tonight.  I live in ballard, wa.  My building has a rooftop deck. The sun had set and the sky was mostly dark now. I was smoking a cig, and watching the normal path of air traffic that flows into Seatac airport.  I just happened to be looking at a patch of ski to my south, when I noticed a flying V- shaped bommerrang craft flying lower than normal air traffic, about 1500 ft, traveling directly east at a high rate of speed.  It was completely dark..no aircraft lights at all and completely silent.  If, I held out my arm, it would take my entire hand to fully block the object. It blended in perfectly to the night sky.  It was more like watching an invisible shape blocking the sky behind it as it moved.  I watched the object travel from west to east until it disappeared in the distace and darkness (about 15 seconds).  I don&#39;t believe that anyone could have seen this object unless you just happened to be looking dir! ectly at it, as I was.  I feel kinda freaked out because, #1.  I definitely saw this. 2.  Because I know that I definitely saw this, what was it?, and what is it doing?  This is not a joke.  I am someone who knows the value of the scientific method. Summary:  Flying craft, completely silent and extremely stealthy, flew over Ballard, Wa.<n>

Talking on the phone while parked on the street, 4 flying craft in a diamond pattern caught my attention over head at a high altitude and traveling very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what I saw but I didn&#39;t see wings and they stayed in perfect formation.  So as I was watching the first 4 they disappeared very quickly and about 20 seconds later in the same area as the first 4 I saw 2 more flying side by side at the same speed going in the same direction passed over.  I couldn&#39;t tell what color they were if anything they were silver.<n>

When I got out side I noticed right away 3 different orbs flying in a triangle the orbs then moved out of formation circled around each other and then made a perfect horizontal line and started flying in formation again. Then all at the same time they sort of just dimed out. This all happened within 4 or 5 minutes they most have traveled across the sky 6 or 7 miles. These lights were like nothing I have ever seen before. They were so intelligent and magical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

It was amazing, It appeared to the west and looked very close to my location. I could not see the bottom of the flash because of the garage impeding my view. The size of the flash was amazing, It was easily the size of a small house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was dead silence and my two dogs did not react at all. I used to be a fireman and have seen my fair share of transformers exploding and other such events. This was completely new to me. No power was out anywhere that I could tell in the apartment complex or the housing division behind it. I have never seen anything like this in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color was almost a purple blue with what could have been a trick of the eye a reddish border. It flashed like lightning but always seemed to be solid never blinking out.<n>

There was a very very dim orange glow coming from the ports. They where half moon shaped, and concaved. The event took place between 10:20 pm and 10:30.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound, wasn&#39;t anymore than 100 feet off the ground, and cruising smoothly along.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was coming out of the  north traveling due south at approx. 2000 feet. The object appeared to traveling maybe 60mph. slow..it flew directly over our position , we ran outside and watched it travel directly overhead.. i could hear a very faint low rumble. The lighting configuration was unlike anything ive seen before . Down the middle of object appeared 3 red lights spaced out in line,surrounding the lights were 4 white lights in large square , all blinking. The object was large around 100 feet long , couldnt make out outline of craft.. because of unusual light configuration ,wasnt triangle. It appeared to be flying square, or possibly a capital I shape., very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have held a steady job for the last 5 years.  I am a veteran and believe in numbers and facts only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night, I went outside for a cigarette like I normally do.  Occasionally I will pull out my phone and use my google sky map application to observe the night sky.  I looked up to the stars while the app was loading and noticed a star slowly moving south.  Keep in mind a couple things, i live about 10 mins. from the U.S./Mexico border, and the flight paths run east/west over my home.  As I was looking at the light I was wondering what plane could get to that altitude.  I was trying to distinguish the navigation lights, but didn&#39;t see any.  The light then made a sharp 90 degree turn towards the east, sped up by an astonishing amount before disappearing. The whole thing lasted about 3 mins.  One thing of great importance, when the light turned, it traveled between half and 3/4 of the dista ce it had already traveled in about a second before it faded and disappeared.  It was a clear sky where i was with no clouds. It disappeared into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared in the woods in our backyard.  I was worried that it was an aircraft that was in distress.  As we went to the window to get a closer look, it was obvious that it was not an airplane.  It was hovering in the woods in our backyard.  It was bright white and almost appeared to be moving up and down very slowly.  It&#39;s shape appeared cylindrical.  I went out in the car to see if I could get a better look one street over.  My husband said that as soon as I drove off, it disppeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We stopped to have something to eat before leaving, I was busy setting up things, but noticed that a red light appeared on a hill not far from us,and I also noticed that it turned off as quickly as it appeared I figured they found there campsite, and continued what I was doing. We finished eating when the red light appeared again on the hillside, and it also appeared to be throwing a white light against the side of the hill (headlights) but while that did not seem odd, this did it was moving horizontal along the side of this hill, but when it moved above the hill I begin to take notice. Now I am looking at two hills separated by a saddle, height of the hil! l#1  approximately 200&#39; sloping side&#39;s hill#2 same height, but only one side slope&#39;s down to 100&#39; hill&#39;s run east to west my location is 1/4 m north, sky is clear, temp 50&#39;s  The sun had set 20minutes earlier. The red light moves between the two hill&#39;s and separate&#39;s into three bright white sphere&#39;s they form abreast of each other and move in unison. At the base of hill#2 something totally different is happing, picture this 4 columns of red lights stacked one on top of other, like the warning lights on towers moving from right to left and in unison with what appeared to be white lights moving with the columns of red lights which look like the  head light of vehicles passing in front of some obstruction blinking effect, I thought that it was vehicles on hwy 14, but the hwy was some distance away, all this went on for about 30-40 minutes this was a performance for our enjoyment or just showing off! that is the only explanation I offer. the finale to this show was the 3 sphere! s reformed into 1 bright white sphere which turned 180&#39; toward! s us exp anded and brighten then simply blinked gone! This story is not finished. I decided that it would be prudent to pack up and leave, which is what we did. During the period of increased mining the need for a post office was met and one was constructed, the B.L.M. has restored the office as best they could, I noticed the building has we drove past it going  out of the valley.  We found the road which would take us to the highway and home, but something was wrong because instead of the highway we found the post office, again,and again, and again,and again, low fuel stopped the madness we decided to rest until morning. and when morning arrived I had parked 20&#39; from the post office again knowing this it still took more then an hour to find the trail the only trail out of that place all trails are marked by B.L.M. signs Well there it is I had ruled out Military because of the nature of the display there was no other persons in the general area, there was no sound these vehicles were! unidentified, and airborne objects (U.F.O.)<n>

The setting sun was at the horizon line and the sky was a wondrous mix of warm orange and clear blue. It was the beauty of the sky that caught my attention, causing me to look up. In front of me, high in the sky and far in the distance, I saw three distinct, separate, yet identical shapes. From my perspective, they could best be described as lines. Three short, separate, white lines in the sky, completely motionless, neither moving nor growing. As I stared for a moment, trying to decipher what they were, one of them vanished in the blink of an eye, while the other two remained. Literally, in one moment there were three and then in an instant, there were two.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This time the colors are more vivid!!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home late from my 2nd shift job, and pulled in my drive way.  I noticed those flickering craft in the clear night sky again!   I have reported these crafts 3 different times to three different organizations! This makes # 4.   But no one will take me serious.   I HAVE VIDEO AND LOTS OF IT, THEREFORE  I HAVE PROOF!!!!  But  these amazing air crafts, just keep showing up!!!!!! I have looked at many reports and to my surprise , A lot of people are reporting the same thing.   Flickering lights that emit multi colors, and then the light orange ones that  don’t  flicker. The light orange ones are different!  They slowly dim down and  move and then slowly light back up.  They  move the same as the flickering ones though!    A LOT OF PEOPLE  ARE SEEING  THE SAME AIR CRAFTS!!!!   From the east coast to the west!!!!  If your reading this please contact me!!!  I will show you!!!!!   EVERY NIGHT THE SKY IS CLEAR THEY ARE THERE!!!  	  Some nights they are more active then others.  And on  02/18/10 they were  active and flickering brighter than ever!!  I’ve seen them so much now that  I  always assume they are there.  And when I look, sure enough there they are!  I always confirm it by waiting for them to move.   I have 6 rough hours of video edited down to 2 hours.  Plus on the 18th of Feb, I taped some more!!!!!!  You can see the movements on tape but its hard to see, because I believe these crafts are hovering possibly outside of our atmosphere.  Making them who knows how far away!!!!   But you can see the movements on tape and a lot easier with the naked eye!!!  On 02/18/10 I had to get out my video camera due to the fact that, I’ve never seen the multi colors so bright and vivid before!  On this night two of them where unusually bright and vivid, and these two looked liked identical twins, both flickering at the same rate and everything!!!!  Then there was 1 normal  whitish one flickering out in th! e distances.   But when I got my wife outside to look she was also surprised that the colors where so noticeable, but then she pointed out that the  orange one that was almost straight above us,  was dimming down.  And when I looked I saw it dim down and  move around  erratically and then stop and brighten up.   Just to repeat its self and dim down again and move.  It did this over and over again.  They  make all kinds of weird turns, stops, loops, dips and zig zags.  There is no craft known by the general public that is capable of what they do.  I have lots of theories about  who they are and what there doing , and  how they do what they do.   But I need help bringing this to light!!!!!!!  I need more witnesses, and a lot better camera!!!!!    WE NEED TO BELIEVE AND HAVE FAITH IN EACH OTHER!!!!!!!!!         I would really love to  meet up with anyone  and show them what I’m seeing.   I promise ,  you will believe me if you allow me to show you!!!!!!!!!!!!               Ple! ase contact me!!!!!<n>

We noticed three red flashing lights in the sky some distance away. They pulsed light and were very bright. They were going far too fast to be airplanes, even too fast to be jet fighters. If anything, I&#39;d say they were missiles but they looked like they were flying in formation and didn&#39;t have a trail of smoke behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The time was about 11:45Pm.  We were visiting my aunt, in ICU in Port Arthur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just activated(the Google Navigator)on my 3G phone.  I was thinking to myself how cool!, we are tracking in virtual time on a satalite map...&#34;this must be the way we appear from an arial view.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that same instant my friend who was driving,in a calm collective manner says, &#34;See I told you that there are UFO&#39;s around here!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up, my eyes immeadiately fixated, to the top left corner of the windshield.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And....Sure enough!!!  There IT was!!!!  Traveling east bound, about 200 ft above the hwy.  It appeared to be pulsating a irradescent/flouresent bright rainbow color, however all of the colors displayed at the same time........<n> <n><n> <n><n> I find that words are very difficult to express completely what we expireinced!!!  There is just not any vocabulary that I know of that can replicate what we saw!!  However, I will continue at the risk of sounding completely out of my mind...lol<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three Rumboid shaped pulsating objects they seemed to be seperate, but yet as one unit?!?!?  silently/fluidly traveling east bound,paralell to hwy 73...  I have always had a scientific curriosity.... I asked my friend&#34;DID YOU SEE THAT?!?!WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!!????<n> <n><n> <n><n> four times, I also rolled all of the car windows down and I opened the sun roof.  This was to reassure myself that we were&#39;nt just seeing a reflection off of the car&#39;s glass and the fact that my friend confirmed four times that we were both seeing the same phenomina.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I opened the sun roof, never taking my eyes off of the object, I popped my head up through the sun roof, and said WOW!!!! that&#39;s no reflection!!!  That&#39;s a Bonified UFO!<n> <n><n> <n><n> That very instant, the object made an immeadiate U-turn!!!!!!!!!  And now it was following us down hwy73!!!  I never once left visual contact with the object.  I jumped down into my seat and shouted &#34;THEY ARE COMING!!!! THEY ARE FOLLOWING US!!  keep in mind that this is a dark and d! esolate hwy at this time of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept my eye on it, while my friend was franticly speeding up to get away!  I could see the same colors pulsating 100FT above the pavement behind us!! ,but it seemed very different than what colors you or I are use to???!!! I was almost hypnotysed by this strange sight…<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I realized that we were not only being folowed but, also being monitored on a level that no Human/Animal could even begin to comprehend!!!  I could see the triangle shaped pulsating Rumboids getting larger, and closer, leaving and getting smaller, and yet not moving at all?!!?!?!?  well my friend, as strange as it may sound, all of this was taking place simutaneousley,  My eyes and brain were not quiet sure how to process all of this together!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We became panicked and sped up to approx. 120mph.  Again this thing never changed perspective, of course we were speeding, but the object stayed behind us, but not ever moving?!!??!!?<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend says to me&#34;STOP STARING AT IT&#34;!! The object got almost to the back of my car, then I noticed a yellow/amberish colored column of light slowly coming down to the ground from the object... then the column of light became very very bright, nontransparent, and became almost like an orange fire ball. I could see the grass and the dirt flying about ,under this fireball!! I started screaming&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;THEY ARE GOING TO BLOW US UP!!!!!!!&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34; that instanst, the object started to wobble? And the air all around it seemed to ripple as if it were H20?!?!?! Then the object became one with the column of orange/yellow light, it reminded me of how Mercury looks on a hard surface. And all in the same split second, the object then became a bright large sphere, with the same pulsating colorfull pattern... I was shell shocked!!!! Did i just see that take place in this demension/this planet/this Whatever!!!!! By this time I could feel a presence in my persona,,,,not anything unusual,,,no strange voices, but almost like my subconcious ! was suddenly in charge?!!?!I never once felt threatened in that sense, but I was subtlely able to become aware of this new/unfamilair feeling in my head?!?! Sounds lunicital ,I know!!!! but like I said, there is no vocabulary that we have as a species that could come close to propperly describing these events,senses,feelings,&#34;phenominas&#34; We continued for for few minutes, then I noticed two cars traveling east bound were coming,after what seemed like an eternity!! I was wide eyed of course waiting to see if those cars would notice what was following us. Sure enough.......they all slammed on thier brakes and pulled to the side of the road!!! at that time the object behind us, backed down and in a split second, the sphere divided into two and disapered!!!!!! I feel like someone else out there had to have seen something. if so please share.  I feel a sense of isolation from people who have never expireinced these phenominas,  Almost like I can not communicate to them the events that took place that cold clear stary night! I cant help but look to the sky every moment I am outdoors!!!!  I am still a bit &#34;rattled&#34; not threatened per say...but I have a sense that who/what ever that was, is still out there, and knows where I am and what I think before I think it!!!!! well there you go!!! that&#39;s my first encounter/interaction with anything/one that has that magnitude of capabilities..<n>

It first looked like Orion&#39;s Belt but noticed that there was a red sphere shaped objeillct that was pulsating. Asked my mom to look and she saw it too.  Told my dad and since he stated &#34;I worked out there before, they are just testing&#34;.  I made the comment, &#34;How can you test something that is still? It&#39;s not moving nor is it being tested&#34;  This happened for about 45 Minutes but driving in that part of Texas is like driving in Colorado.  So the duration could have been shorter, not really sure, but all I know is that,  There was something out there that was NOT Military<n>
2/16/10 22:15|Mesquite|TX|Rectangle|30 seconds|Rectangle UFO with 4 Dim Red Lights|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74425.html|84|ndxe201002| Rectangle UFO with 4 Dim Red Lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a rectangle shape UFO moving from east to west at night time. It had 4 very dim red lights on each end and was solid black. This was at night. It moved with no sound at all. passed over my head and was out of sight in about 30 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im not sure if this was because it was moving fast or because the lights were very dim. I called the police dept a couple of days later and there was no reports of this thing. I was the only one that saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no FAA lights just 4 very dim red lights on each corner and the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it was one structure because I could not see between the red lights and the lights did not change in formation so it was solid and seem to be moving slow and did not go up higher or go lower. It was moving as a public airliner plane would be moving at 30,000 feet but the UFO was much closer to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have never known it was there unless I was looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I talked to some people at the gas station and a couple of customers were telling me that they have seen red glowing UFOs in my city and others close by at night too but not a brick shape like I saw but round like a saucer with red lights also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At least Im not the only one that has seen these things around here. But they said they never saw a brick shape UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also it was not as high as a public airliner would be. Only maybe a 1000 feet more or less above the ground. This is my first UFO sighting.<n>

Even my wife saw them and took a picture of one. my wife had problems with her camera after taking one picture.<n>
2/16/10 20:00|Denver|CO|Unknown|20 mins|Bright star looking object moved in sky and turned red, blue, green, yellow and hovered in sky|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74403.html|86|ndxe201002| Bright star looking object moved in sky and turned red, blue, green, yellow and hovered in sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing on my apartment patio on the third floor about 30 ft high.  I looked out into the sky and saw what appeared to be a bright star.  I realized that it wasn&#39;t a star because of the objects slow movement.  It didn&#39;t have any of the typical characteristic movement patterns of a plane either.  I got my sister from inside to come observe with me.  She also agreed that it didn&#39;t appear to be anything like a plane or anything that she recognized.  The object still had a bright iridescent white shine as it slowly moved.  As I watched it more, the object seemed to dim in radiance of the white glow being shown, as if the light was being dimmed down.  The object seemed to stay in one place and then slowly move in a linear fashion.  Not anything like any aircraft.  The object then appeared to start flashing different colors. It would flash a bright red, then bright green, bright blue, and yellow and then back to white in no particular order.  It seemed like the entire object donned the color that it turned to, much unlike blinking aircraft lights that are separated by wing space.  As the object turned different colors it seemed to hover in one place.  It would then slowly do a somewhat figure eight pattern or a circular movement pattern and would at instances seemingly accelerate very quickly and then slow back down and then just hover in place.  It kept doing this and I went inside after about 20 minutes.  I came back out hours later and it was gone.<n>

Almost paralell with the 10 Fwy about 3 miles north of fwy.  It had a bright red light that did blink below a white light. above the white light was another red light that blinked only going over certain areas.   At one point there was a sparkling light that did travel from the white light to the red light on top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mind you this is not a plane, jet, or helicopter.  The red light on top would have been at least 3 to 4 stories high from the white light and the red light never blinked in the same spot above the white light.<n>

He simply just loved driving, its what he liked to do, so I knew we were going to really be going out into the country.  Around nine or ten we were still just talking, when he kinda of dazed off.  I had not noticed what he was looking at until he started yelling that he saw a ufo.  Naturally I didn&#39;t believe him.  Too far fetched for me.  He told me that he saw a strange green light stay still in the sky fore a few brief moments, then zig zag back in for rapidly a few times, then take off again not to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later in the night I had to go to the town over to get to my girlfriends house, around the time I got on the freeway I noticed a green light.  I watched in amazement for a bit eating my own words.  I immediately called him and told him I witnessed the exact same same thing.  I am open to the possibility of it being a military, gas, etc...but bottom line, I have never seen any aircraft move like that, nor a meteor that stays put in the sky for seconds at a time, zips around, then vanishes.<n>

I noticed something small, bright (reflecting light) and spherical in the sky outside my window.  It remained in a stationary position just inland of the coast. From my position I estimated it was pretty high, as the Long Beach air traffic was flying well below it.  Yet for ten minutes it did not move, so I ruled out balloon and blimp.  I tried to record it with my video camera, but the reflectivity of the object and the distance of it made recording impossible, it simply wasn&#39;t registering in my view finder...  As I put my camera down it began moving slowly toward Seal Beach (Naval Weapons Station) direction.  By 16:15 pst it was out of my visual range.  There was only one object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background is irrelevant to the sighting.  I am not ex-military or law enforcement, and I have only seen a UFO one other time, with two friends in 1994.  Turned out to be a prototype for a DRONE the military was testing over the neighborhoods of Lakewood, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So this could be anything.  I am simply reporting it.  Hope someone else out there got a better look at it than i did.  Perhaps the pilots passing underneath it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

As I pulled onto the paved road, I saw a huge circle of amber light rays coming straight down from the sky northeast of my location.  The origin of the rays was circular about the size of approximately 3 to 4 baseball stadiums.  It appeared to have lots of small circles of lights which emitted the rays of light coming down towards the ground.  They didn’t appear to hit the ground however.  My first inclination was to justify something so out of the ordinary, by telling myself it must be the sun shining through the clouds; but it was still dark and in the wrong direction for sunrise not to mention it did not move nor was it time for sunrise.  I sat and took pictures of it for approximately 15 minutes and as the sky lit up with the sunrise, the ray emitting object stayed stationary and the rays faded with the morning light.<n>

I am including her contact phone number in the appropiate section.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Alien Encounter - Alien Encountered in Cheatham County, TN  I reside in Cheatham County, Tennessee, and observed an alien in my yard in February this year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I am coming forward is because the description the woman in Georgia provided of the 3 alien beings she observed at a campsite where she and her husband were camping the latter part of 2009 is almost exactly the same as what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 5:00 in the morning.  There was still snow on the ground from the last snow.  I had gotten ready for work and was sitting in my Suzuki in the drive letting it warm up before leaving for my job in Nashville, Tennessee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I caught movement out of the corner of my eye in the area of my garage (which is used for storage and not to pull a car into).  At first, I thought it was one of the neighbor&#39;s dogs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to look and saw something which very closely matched the description of the alien creatures which the woman in Georgia observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its body, extra long arms and hind legs were so thin.  Its head was very large and bumpy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was pale in color and hairless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very cold outside, and the creature appeared a light grayish color (I&#39;m not sure whether the cold temperature would have affected the appearance of the color).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only difference in my story and hers is that the 3 creatures she saw were upright.  This was moving on all 4&#39;s, however, the way it was moving made it appear like a monkey or gorilla that are oftentimes upright, but then use their arms in conjunction with their legs to propel themselves forward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On all 4&#39;s, it was about the height of a large dog, and I observed that it would be considered short, compared to most humans, if it stood upright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its legs were short, quite a bit stockier than the body and arms, which were long and skinny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept looking back as though it thought it was being followed, and so it was surprised to see me sitting inside the automobile when it looked around, directly at me, for the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a good look at its large, round eyes which were darkish in color.  They appeared a dark brown.  It was as though it sensed I wasn&#39;t going to hurt it, and it continued on across my yard, across the road, and continued out a connecting road which is directly in front of my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are lots of wooded areas in the direction it was traveling, and lots of wooded area behind my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not comfortable just ignoring this occurrence. Questions are racing through my mind - questions which need to be answered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What are these creatures doing in our wooded areas, hiding out by day and wandering by night?  Where did they come from?  Are they depleting any of our resources?  Will they become dangerous if someone acts aggressively toward them?  (I was so busy looking at its eyes and bumpy head that I cannot describe a nose and/or mouth.)  I am a sane individual who is employed at one of Nashville&#39;s most prominent law firms.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness, and source of report, indicate that date is approximate.

There were four objects in total, each appearing to be triangular or diamond-shaped.  They were lit yellowish white at the center and had red spots at their edges.  One object was immediately to the east.  One was immediately to the west.  The last two were to the southeast and southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around midnight a low-pitched humming noise could be heard, even within our home.  The neighborhood is generally quiet at night, so the noise was easy to hear.  This is the second time that we have seen the lights.  The previous time was the first or second Tuesday in January.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Earlier that evening, there had been a series of sonic booms that were similar to a series of sonic booms heard all along the Gulf Coast last fall.  The booms were heard over several nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the initial sighting, an attempt at photographing the objects was made, but t! hey did not appear in the picture.<n>

I thought it is a heading light of an aircraft landing as my area is in the airport landing way.  The direction of the light was from the west to the east and this is not the airport runway direction so i started to dout about the light and also it was a single light and aircrafts are having blinking lights plus the heading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the light was moving very very slow for long time then it started to become very weak slowly till it is totally switched off.  after the light switched off i could trace the moving object as it was a clerly circle shape shaded object in front of the sky stars plus a very weak green colored as if a lamp switched off.  The speed of the object changed and became very fast moving far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> before it dissapears i saw it coming to lower level and i could recognize the common UFO shape very far away before it disappers behind the surrounding buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: The weather was very very clear that night with no clouds.<n>

I have no idea what this thing is but I saw one about 4 nights ago and tried to get a video but it left to soon.  This video starts out a little shaky and blurry but it gets better.  I think i got some pretty clear shots of whatever it was.  Anyway, please excuse my language, as I was kind of excited when i shot the video, and i bruised my shin tripping over a stump and got poked in the face with a stick while i was trying to film.  I guess this makes me an official UFO chaser. LOL :)<n> <n><n> <n><n> BTW, did anyone else living in Redding see this?

At first, we thought we were seeing  two  helicopters in the sky but  noticed  as they were moving from South to North in straight pattern that the lights will change from solid red to orange simultaniously, like a strobe light, and then when both  objects came to a stop, the lights went back to solid red.  All of a sudden the closest light to the South faded away and disappeared.  Then a couple seconds after, the light closest to North began to fade away and also disappeared in the sky.<n>

It was high up enough in the sky that we initially thought it was a plane, or a light on a tower, however it moved very slowly across the sky, and was slightly lower than a conventional plane.  The light faded out slightly faster than it appeared.  It reappeared moments later, and again vanished.  As I began talking about it, it re appeared one last time, much brighter and faster than before.  It looked very similar to a bright ember from a burst firework falling through the sky. It moved slowly at first, this time away from us rather than across our view.  It darted away very rapidly and faded out.  We did not see it again after this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was slightly cloudy, with stars peeking out, the area has some light pollution, with  some very dark stretches of land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was spotted by an educated artist and an IT professional.  Neither has seen lights of this nature in the sky before, and is familiar with the area, planes, and the location of lit towers.<n>

Bright Orange light appeared in the Western sky.  Bright enough to make me and three other people take notice.  It moved slowly but then stopped.  There was no noise. I stood and watched the light for 2 or 3 minutes during which it slowly faded but did not change its position in the sky.  We get a lot of aircraft movement over this location every night and I am used to seeing these, but this was different.  This is why I am taking the time to report it.<n>

Shaped like an oval or sphere.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74366.html|111|ndxe201002| Three orange lights on top and four yellow lights on the bottom. Shaped like an oval or sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out on the patio in my backyard at about 7:15 pm (EST) when I noticed a very strange accumulation of lights. It was still. No movement was made for at least one minute. There were four yellow lights (I thought it was a cluster of stars I&#39;d never seen before) very close together and just above them were three orange(?)lights, one was above and between the 1st and second yellow lights,the 2nd orange light was above and between the second and third yellowlights and the third orange light was above and between the third and fourth yellow lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stared at this for a minute or so and thought it was very odd. Then, the entire object swiftly moved across the sky with no real direction. I followed it&#39;s course for about 20 seconds as it moved over the roof of a house and I could  no longer follow it. It was nothing like I&#39;ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I looked up, basically straight up but facing west, I noticed a line of dim objects, about 30-40 (I will use rough numbers in my description because of how quick event happened) and my first thought was that it was birds reflecting the city lights, but then the objects split into 3 separate groups, one with about 10 objects, the middle one around 20 and the third (farthest group from me) was maybe about 15, again just rough numbers, I didn’t have time to count!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The group was traveling in a southern direction, from where I was in Sunnyvale, I’d say they were directly over Mountain View, about 2 miles west of me.  That path would take them over Cupertino, Saratoga, then the northern edge Santa Cruz Mountain range (around here we call them the Cupertino and Saratoga hills).  The group was moving at a good rate of speed, it was hard for me to focus on them because they were so spread out, and I was trying to see if I could discern any shape, which vaguely they were each a slight V-shape, but I’m not 100% on that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sighting lasted maybe 10-15 seconds, and at the end of it they all seemed to group together and fade out, which is why I think they were only reflecting city light and they dimmed out going over the mountains.   A group of birds could not travel that distance that fast across this valley.  I tried to stay focus on the direction they faded out but saw nothing more.  About 30 seconds later I heard a plane and saw its ! flashing navigation lights, in the same west direction I was facing but far lower, I believe small planes over this area have to be around 1500-2000 ft, so using that these objects were higher, but I could not estimate for sure what height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They made no sound, and moved very quickly in combining and separating their groups.<n>

Crystal clear day.  There were three round globes that formed a triangle.  Next to it on the right of the triangle were two round globes that were reddish and glowing.  This was mostly stationery, but the two globes to the right of the triangle seemed to move a little.  Watched for about 30 seconds and then went to get my camera, turned back instead and saw that the formation was gone. I got my binoculars and looked for it, but it had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I was laying in bed I looked over at the large picture window across the hall.After a few minutes I saw an amazingly bright light beam shoot through the window, lasting 10 seconds. Even though it was of a light quality I had never before seen, I assumed it was one of my other brothers shining a light in my face. I ignored it and was about to go to sleep when my dad walked up the stairs and asked if we had been messing around with a strobe light.He then thought that maybe a police helicopter or swat team was searching for somebody. It was then we all concurred that we saw something extremely odd. We all walked toward the window and then again, this time only about 5 seconds, and it vanished. We could see nothing else in the sky because the whole sky lighted up, but the beam branched out to concentrate in out attic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have never seen anything like that before or since. Ever since the occurrence the electricity in our house has been power surging and shorting. The next day me and my brother felt disoriented and unbalanced although we never consume  alcohol.In our car coins were sticking together and the clock was flashing 12:00 as if the car&#39;s electrical system turned off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Emmediately I notice to balls of fire.  They were orange and they were moving.  They moved for a few minutes getting closer and then light started shooting out of them on the bottom and they disapeared, first one, then a minute later the other one. That was in the west.  The third one came from the north and looked like it was coming straight towards my direction.  It was big and bright. I had time to go and wake up my husband so he could come outside and see.  When he came out, it took what seemed like five minutes for it to shoot out light and then sputter out and disapear.  After that happened.  About five minutes later, what looked like a very big bag was floating down and it landed on the main street about seven houses down from my house.  I think that was just a bag, I could&#39;t tell because it was dark.  It made me want to go down the street though to look, but my husband wasn&#39;t willing to go because its cold and late, so I stayed in and got on the internet to see if anyone else saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen manys strange things in the sky, but never that.  I saw something once that looked like a battle happening in space.  I counted 14 total lights chasing each other.  I would have taken a picture of what i saw, but I don&#39;t have a camera.<n>

It was in sight when I went outside,  Due east from the Ca. coast, possibly as far away as over the Sierras.  It was twinkling, a bit like a christmas tree, in red, blue, green and white.  I watched it for about 30 seconds, and then it just disappeared.  I initially thought it might be a plane, or possibly the I.S.S., but they don&#39;t typically have that shape, that brilliance, and don&#39;t just blank out like a candle that&#39;s been blown out.<n>

I believed it to be a star but it was brighter and yellow.  then i thought it to be a satelite or a plane.  It moved like neither.  It changes directions on a dime and moves very fast for short distances unlike anything i believe our technology has produced.  the part i cant understand is the way it changes directions.  it has been in a few locations and tends to move around.  i usually find it around the little dipper though.  the movements are very subtle though,  it may take u awhile to find it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Saw three red lights blinking one after another in a vertical line slanted backward that were also going east parallel to highway.  I kept my eye on it for 2-3 minutes trying to figure out if the unusual lights were part of a helicopter or plane.  The object then starting heading south and lights disappeared.<n>

Both lights were flying exactly parallel with our vehicle, and appeared to be about the size and speed of a small jet or helicopter preparing to land. We quickly discounted this explanation because of the green color of both lights and the fact that they immediately disappeared in what looked like mid-air. After we had turned on to Hwy. 152, we looked back behind us to our left and could see no evidence of a conventional aircraft like possibly a low flying cropduster with lights having landed on the groun! d. We did not hear any sound during the sighting, either. I&#39;m wondering if this could be another instance of the notoriously frequent Hwy. 5 UFO?  Witnesses are both female and work in health care related occupations, one is a doctor and the other is an instrument technician.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From my position, it was about the size of a pencil eraser; maybe slightly larger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had time to stand up and look at it, then I went out on the back porch, which is on the north side of the house, to see if I could see it anymore, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My 1st thought was that it was a meteor, but it would have had to be huge to  be bright enough for me to see, since my overhead light was on.<n>

My wife was driving our suv and saw the craft as well.  She thought it may be a radio tower.  The object was about ¼ to ½ mile from the freeway and about 1,000 feet up.  I would say 3 times the height of a tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was clearly a craft; there was no discernable fuselage, wings or rotor. It appeared in the shape of a football, and I could see into it enough to see more lights. There were 2 very bright white lights and numerous smaller lights within the craft of other colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled down the window as we passed and took a good look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was so stationary that it was very peculiar.<n>

It was extremely dark out, and the sky was very clear. As he was partway down the driveway, he noticed a group of lights to the north at an elevation of perhaps 45 to 60 degrees (Vermont’s mountainous horizon makes this difficult to judge). They were blinking like the running lights on aircraft, but as if there were three or four aircraft passing right next to each other while heading in different directions. This apparent cluster was what caught his attention, but a moment later he observed the appearance of another light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light, slightly to the south of the cluster, appeared much larger than the others did, my father estimating its apparent diameter to be at least four times that of the largest stars and planets from his perspective, with intensity to match. He described it as being a light orange-yellow color that made him think of a motorcycle headlamp. He wondered if it was from an aircraft’s landing lights, but after a few seconds, it went out in the way that an incandescent lightbulb does when switched off. At this point, he saw that the group of smaller lights was no longer present, but one remaining light had moved south and was heading away from the point where the large light had been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved south, still blinking every second or so. After a few seconds of it moving on this path, another large light appeared at the position of the smaller one. The smaller light kept moving, but the larger light remained completely stationary, not drifting or arcing in the way a flare or even a helicopter with a spotlight might. This happened twice more over the next few seconds, so that there were three large lights marking the smaller one’s previous path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The small light made a “u-turn” back towards the north, blinking all the while. My father described as being as if a car going at a reasonable speed had made a 180-degree turn, but an aircraft going an equivalent speed for his viewpoint would have needed a much larger turning radius. After the smaller light had traveled some distance from the others, all three large lights went out simultaneously, in the same lightbulb-like way the first one had. Through all of this, my father had not heard the slightest sound, except for a large jet that approached from the south after the light finished its turn. The entire incident took less than a minute. At this point, he ran inside to get my mother and myself, but by the time we got outside the light had disappeared, and the jet passed over our house to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father has excellent vision and hearing, a good knowledge of the conditions that can cause many aerial phenomena, and a great love of stargazing, but he has been at a loss to explain what he saw. If the bright lights had not appeared, he would have not given what he observed a second thought, but their intensity and utter lack of movement were like nothing he has ever seen. He has drawn a diagram of the lights’ path and thoroughly explained it to me, but I, too, cannot explain it. The only thought that occurred to me was that he might have seen some sort of ball lightning, but he witnessed an instance of ball lightning in his youth and said that it was not at all like what he saw. He also inquired at the nearest airport, but their only explanation was that Black Hawk helicopters have recently been in use nearby. We found this suggestion unlikely, as the helicopters that frequently pass near our house are particularly loud and my father heard no sounds save the engines of! the jet that appeared just before he ran to find us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In short, we are absolutely stumped as to what he might have observed.<n>

There were two other gentlemen that were maintnence, they were testing the pool for chlorine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked into the sky and saw two star like objects, the first I saw for one second, and it whisked away before I had time to focus on it.  The other hung in the air for about 5 minutes and did not move.  The sun hit it and you could tell it was a metallic object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went over to the maintnence workers and asked if they saw what I was looking at and they did.  They did not know what it was either and were very flabbergasted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the three of us watched it, it began to glow orange.  Then it changed shaped, then again, back to a star like shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then began to move across the sky very slowly, until we could not see it anymore.<n>

Then it headed north and I followed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stopped about mile up the road and I pulled over again.  It just hovered below the clouds and genlty swayed.  After several more minutes I watched vanish into thin air.<n>

After the event it seemed to take about ten min. to get into Kettleman City, traveling on Highway 41.  If the direction of the road that we were on was 12 o&#39;clock, the lights were at about 12:30. The lights were in a triangle position with equal distance between, if they were connected on the perimeter.  There were seven lights that were red and that did not blink like an airplane.  The lights then began to move an incredible distance in a short amount of time, going from the 12:30 position, to the 2:30 position within 5 seconds, and then stops.  It seemed 20 miles off now, and about 10 times closer than when first spotted with the lights in the same formation.  We then pulled over off the road to try to get video on the cell phone and that is when it elevates straight up, what had to be a couple of miles, stops for 2 seconds, and ! then accelerates off at about 3 o&#39;clock until the lights faded out within 2 or 3 sec.  It seemed odd that before we got back on the road after about 2 min., that no cars passed by us.  It was odd because about two miles before we saw the lights, we passed two slower moving cars going in our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drew a picture of the lights when i got home. If you want to contact me i could fax the drawing. I told two people i trust the most about this and I&#39;m not bringing it up again. It didn&#39;t go over to well, just not worth it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I own a construction business in California. My perception of angles and distance are sharpened every week, so what I can not explain is how something could move so far, so fast, then stop, and then elevate straight up.<n>

Building is located at 459 n Gilbert Rd in Gilbert, Az.  I saw in the north area of the sky, over the apartment building across the street a set of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two steady white lights with blinking red light equidistance in between them.  The red light was smaller than the two white lights and appeared to flash off something metallic or silvery in color when it was blinking.  The object was about the size of my thumb to the second joint held horizontally at arm’s length, that was the width of the object.  There was absolutely no sound.  The object moved in a slow and gliding motion towards the west and slightly northwest.  At first I thought it might be a plane, but it had no flashing red and green wingtip lights and no sound.  Also the lights didn’t look like a helicopter and again there was no sound and it had that gliding motion.  I lost it behind the trees, it was that low and then caught a glimpse of it again further away and more to the west and slightly northwest but then lost it again behind the buildings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see it emerge from behind the buildings so it may have turned more northerly or it may have descended even further.  I went back into my workplace.  The entire sighting took no more than 2 minutes I would guess…maybe 3 tops.<n>

It was low enough to describe the flying craft.  My girlfriend had a great view and she describes a metal object with green lights on the upper part of the craft.  She also mentioned red lights underneath the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft had an oval shape.  There were many planes around that time so I must believe that those airplanes had the object at least on their radar.  My girlfriend mentioned it to some people and at least ten witnessed it and took pictures with their cellular phones.  I called my brother also and he took a picture of it, which I possess.  At the time he took the picture the object was further away and it doesn’t show any shape in the picture but he did capture the color red light of the craft.

When I went outside, I heard an airplane flying over head, and looked up to see it.  I then noticed a white balloon behind it.  This balloon did not keep up with the airplane, and moved SW very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then noticed it was heading for another white balloon in its path.  I went into my house to get my dad&#39;s pair of binoculars and went back outside.  I located them again, and when I looked through the binoculars I noticed a red/orange round shape between them.  I then realized that the two white balloons were actually reflecting the sunlight, and thought they looked more like stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom came out on the porch and I pointed them out to her.  She had to go to work and that was at 10:05 am.  I had been watching them for fifteen minutes now, but after I said goodbye I looked back up and the one that was heading towards the other was now moving in the oppisite direction.  I followed it for a minute and then looked up at it without the binoculars and could not see it.  When I looked through the binoculars it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept watching the sky, but the clouds rolled in and there was no chance of seeing it again.  I now there was a shuttle launch early this morning and that it was delivering a piece of the space station.  I was not going to think twice about it until I saw them move away from each other, and thought that was very strange.  I went to the NASA website to see the launch, and found that the red/orange object couldn&#39;t be the tank, because that falls off ten minutes in to the flight.  This took place six hours later..<n>

Instead of taking a steady path like a satellite, this whitish circle began to make irregular patterns very quickly.  It almost looked like a white/silver balloon that was getting caught up in the wind and was blowing from random gusts of wind.  It remained the same color and brightness, but would zig zag, then seem to stop, then repeat the irregular rapid movement.  I watched it for approximately two minutes until I lost it to the north west.<n>

He called me in and told me to look out the window in the sky.  We live in the country so there is not a lot of light pollution. There was an object that looked to be a star, but slightly larger, and not sure how exactly far away.  It would move in a small area around it, in a zig-zag motion, and it went up and down, and in circles.  It was also flashing colors slowly, such as pinkish purple, red, green, and blue.  It wouldn’t move all the time, but every so seconds it would move.  I know it couldn’t have been a star because of the way it was moving, and just the colors were very vivid.  It seemed to have move up quite a bit from when we first started to watch it.  There was a couple planes, I believe that have also been in the sky, but this was no plane.  It was a very strange sighting, but also a little difficult to see because of the distance.<n>

She screamed that it was a UFO, so my oldest daughter ran to the back of the house to look out and seen it really low too and said it was a black triangle with red lights.  I didn&#39;t get to see it because by the time I went back there it was gone.  But I did feel the house shaking and my windows rattling as if a airplane was going to fall.

They stayed in formation but then I noticed that two of the lights are moving side to side and behind the others like if they were trying to past the others.  At these time I&#39;m in wow.  So I run upstairs to get my wife and we both go outside and I&#39;m trying to explain to her what I just saw and to please look up @ the sky.  A few second later we both see the lights pop out of no where again and she is like &#34;what was that&#34;  I asked her if she heard a noise or something.  She could not believe what she just saw.  It was something that we never have seen before.  I was not a helicopter or a plane we know that much.  What it was we may never know.

Rather bright out due to snow cover and cloud-refracted ground light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects Sighted: Three small, white orb lights, in triangular formation, also moving independently. Appeared as very bright stars, but BELOW the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Duration of Sighting: Approximately 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving to my friend’s house, exiting my neighborhood on a road that runs due west, 90 degrees to US Rt 219, I noticed three bright star-like lights in triangular formation “parked” still in the sky in a southwesterly direction, about 50 degrees from the horizon line.  The lights were seen to my left, out the driver’s side window. Approximate altitude of lights was 2000’ to 2500’.  I was instantly alarmed by this, considering the relatively low clouds, and they stood out plainly. I quickly noticed they were moving together, but suddenly they broke formation and began moving in tight, very quick elliptical maneuvers independently. This went on for about 8 seconds, before the “lead” orb began heading SE. The other two lights stopped their maneuvers, and rejoined in formation behind the “lead” orb. I could plainly see sky in between the objects, indicating they were indeed individuals and not one large triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three were identical in size and brightness. Their velocity seemed the same, as no light moved faster than any of the others. I vocally exclaimed at this, as instinct and logic told me I was witnessing a UFO event. My brain scrambled to find another  explanation. The maneuvers were like that of a aerial dogfight, but all movements were rather fluid, albeit extremely fast and precise. These were much too small and fast to be even military aircraft. Also, the G forces being endured in such a craft must have been immense. Being someone who’s somewhat interested in the UFO phenomenon since a childhood sighting, I didn’t take my eyes off of them. There is no military air base near here, though the lights were in the airspace above our small local airport.  I happen to be an aviation enthusiast as well, and my eyes are often skyward, and I could tell these were no aircraft. They appeared as small, round lights, white in color, and rather bright like mini Christmas lights. I es! timate the size of the objects would be no more than 10’ in diameter. Top speed was in the 200+ MPH range easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As mentioned, they stood out because of the refracted light carried by the clouds, giving an illuminated sort of gray background to my sighting. I continued to watch at a stop sign as the lights maneuvered speedily back into their original triangle formation and proceeded southeast across Rt. 219 at great speed and gaining altitude until they faded out and disappeared through the clouds. There was a moderate amount of traffic, so perhaps I wasn’t the only witness. Anyone traveling south on Rt. 219 may have noticed.  I’d like to note that I’m a college graduate, and I consider myself educated, articulate, and very mentally aware of my environment. I cannot explain what I witnessed. Attached is a basic Photoshop rendering of the objects as they appeared prior to executing the elliptical maneuvers. This is also the same formation they returned to after.<n>

At first I thought it was a airplane, But the closer I looked I noticed these lights were different the craft was moving very slow I had enough time to run in my house and grab the binoculars, I saw bright red yellow and white light all around the bottom of the ship not blinking but pulsing it was flying from the northwest valley heading out to the southwest mesa .<n>

I was sitting on a bench visiting with my mother when I noticed what I thought were 5 geese flying in a v formation from east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After looking at them for a couple of seconds I was shocked realizing that they were not geese since the sun was reflecting upon them showing that they were actually metallic sphere like objects.  The sky was clear and the temp.was about 65 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With excitement I yelled UFO&#39;s and the 3 boys (22, 17, &amp;16 years old) came running to see.  I pointed them out and then I ran into the house to get the binoculars.  When I got back outside I tried to focus on the objects but I was to shaky so I handed them to my son’s friend.  We were all screaming and laughing that we couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they started to go behind the tree line we ran to the corale area in front of the house to continue watching them.  One of the spheres shot off back towards the east disapearing as the other four continued steady and equal distance apart on to the north/west- towards Austin’s Bergstrom Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They slowly just disappeared.  Right before they vanished a white prop plane (about the size of a cigarette butt) was traveling near and behind them to their south.  The plane must have seen them.  We heard the plane but no noise from the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane seemed to have been traveling faster than the spheres.  The spheres were low and slow flying well beneath the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The funny thing is one of my son&#39;s friends was a skeptic until this afternoon.  He even said that he wished he a gotten a picture for the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is 2 hours later and we are still excited and talking about the event,especially since it was a daytime sighting!<n>

About 20 min later, a bright yellow flash shined in my room.  About an hour after that, a bright green flash seemed to light up our whole neighborhood. Right before each of these light anomalies, there was a sort of a revving of an engine sound and then the power would cut out.  We have all under the ground power lines as well as no light posts in our neighborhood.  When looking out our back window, a yellow light seemed to fly past us on 3 separate occasions<n>

They called to the house to have my wife come out and look at these lights in the sky.  She went out on the back deck and then called me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked to the south, there were 3 bright orange lights in a triangle formation low in the sky.  They moved off to the southwest and the lights got dimmer and then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the same time, several more of the bright orange lights came from the SE, low on the horizon.  They moved very slowly, but not in a straight line.  It was more of a jagged line.  It was not normal.  There was a commercial aircraft flying due south at the time that was definitely higher altitude than these lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights slowly moved from east to west then headed south and disappeared.  My wife got some pictures of them on her phone.  One group of 3 and one group of 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very eerie.  There is absolutely no way these were any type of normal aircraft.  They were low in the sky, close to us and were completely silent.

I then saw another to the right, higher and farther away. The first one was close enough to make out the shape and colors of it quite clearly: A distinct triangle of blue, red, green and yellow lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked very much like a Christmas decoration, and if it were in a position to possibly be atop something I wouldn’t have questioned it. But when I saw the other, higher and farther away, also stationary, I was baffled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went around to the front of our house to get a better angle above the tree tops and saw, to the west, two more triangles.  These were dancing in the air. Flitting about. Then they sped off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to the back yard and the two triangles were still there but each higher in the sky and farther away.  So, not stationary, but I was unable to see them move because it was so gradual.  One hour later the two in the back were still visible but much farther away and higher in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live near an air force base and have witnessed Harrier jets come to complete stops in mid air.  I would love to have that be the answer.  I just question why they would be lit up like Christmas trees and stay floating high in the sky for hours.   Also the triangles were always facing me so if they were on the wings and the nose of a plane it would have to have spent all its time on its side to give that view.<n>

But she said there were people in the street looking that way too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
2/4/10 15:00|Nicolosi, Sicily (Italy; Mt. Etna)|TN||5 seconds|Posess surprise daytime image of huge triangle|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74395.html|166|ndxe201002| Posess surprise daytime image of huge triangle<n> <n><n> <n><n> February 16, 2010,  I along with my father viewed an enormous triangle on a July/August evening of 1968 or perhaps 1969 in central Michigan.  The sighting was 5-7 minutes long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped my father’s pick up truck, got out and viewed this massive triangle with a light in each corner.  The front light was huge and lit up the night, though it was as if a spotlight illuminated the ground below.  The other two lights were not as bright.  It was quiet, slow and defied what we knew of how planes fly.  My father is now 85.  A WWII vet and I am 55.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We told only family at the time as it was and remains quite puzzling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fast forward.  I am a contractor of sorts indirectly for the DOD.  I was going up to the ski lodge on Mt. Etna to take a few photographs.  It was a beautiful day with perfectly clear skies.  I took some photographs from my car going up, a few times I pulled over to take the pictures.  I did not notice the image I captured having the triangle in it when I took it.  I simply took a picture from about 6000 feet of the summit.  When I viewed the taken image on the viewfinder, I saw it immediately, but thought of it as an orb.  When downloaded, it reveals what you see.  I know it appears to be invisible, but a daytime photo of this craft does not exist that I am aware of.  Also,  the front light is large and square edged, and there seems to be a circle of impulses near that large light.  It is a remarkable camera and I am a professional.  What do you think?<n>

2/4/10 06:15|Spencerport|NY|Disk|about 15-20 seconds|Saucer like craft with round top and bottom. Strange texture and mixed colors... gliding just above trees.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74283.html|168|ndxe201002| Saucer like craft with round top and bottom. Strange texture and mixed colors... gliding just above trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of February 3, 2010 my 15 year old daughter woke up and looked out the window which her bed is postioned against. She was confussed by lights that she saw in the neighbors back yard. She thought it was strange to see a plane that low and in that area, so she thought it might be a helicopter...but then she realized there was no helicopter sound. She then realized that it was like a disk or saucer shape with purple lights going around it. She noticed 2 round headlights in the front of the craft that she describes as looking like bright car headlamps. The &#34;headlights&#34; faded as they got closer to our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft slanted upward to go above the trees behind our house she noticed the bottom of the craft. She explained that the craft was about the distance of 2 1/2-3 car lengths from her window and noticed a light humming sound. She noticed in detail that the bottom of the craft was roundish oval shaped like the top but longer. It had red and purple light with a pink coloring mixed in it. She says that it is very difficult to explain and that she had never seen anything like it before. She described the bottom to look something like a brain with texture and the colors mixing together. The whole bottomed had a yellowish pink/peachy/ amber glow. She said the bottom seemed to smooth directly in the rest of the metal above the craft. The metalish material looked like grayish black pewter. She describes the bottom as if you could put your hand through a light pink wettish layer but then it would be stopped by a hard layer where the lights seemed to be coming from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She was shocked and then paused for second in her bed and the ran to the bathroom window in the back of our house to see if she could still see it. She seen it just as it was moving over the trees in our back yard.... she said it was gliding right above the trees and moving at a steady slow pace like it was observing something. The craft then faded in the distance beyond the trees. I asked her if it was spinning and she said no. The most remarkable thing to her was the bottom of the craft...she described it a beautiful...but very strange...jello like but firm. According to her the craft was the size of 4 cars put in a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She tends to not believe in these sort of things and is very sincere...therefore I am reporting this because I truely beleive her and it was such a detailed, close sighting. I had her draw a picture. The craft headed toward the wooded area behind our house which has more than 165 acreas of wooded land.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object first appeared to be glowing, but after a closer look, it seemed to be aflame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not appear to be moving quickly, and I did not see it leaving a ‘trail’.  I thought that it was an emergency flare, but I think that a flare is more of a ‘glow’ than a ‘flame’, and this looked more like a flame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seemed to be about 60 degrees up from the horizon when I first spotted it, and directly ahead of me (90 degrees) when I lost sight of it (or at the point it ‘flamed out’).  I hope that I am using the right terminology here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to have lost some elevation as it moved away from me, but without knowing the altitude of the object, there is no way to know how much elevation was lost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object either ‘flamed out’ or moved behind clouds at approximately 8:09 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After arriving home, I called 911, but they had received no other reports of the object.<n>

We decided to try and get closer for a better look but since it was dark our phone cameras were insufficient for pictures. We witnessed the object(s) a few more times, each time rerouting our course adjusting for the change in position of the object. Finally we gave up the chase after seeing no other signs of the object for over ten minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, its important to note that as one light would go out another would appear. Sometimes the string would get to be three or four lights in a diagonal upward row. I have witnessed this before, but my last encounter I owned a radar detector. Each time that the lights would appear, my radar detector would go off as if someone had just shot me with a radar gun. Full blast. I no longer have the detector however, as it broke a few months ago. I am a full-time college student/sophomore to the College of Southern Idaho and manage a restaurant in Jerome ID.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/2/10 19:00|Beckwourth|CA|Unknown|15 Minutes|Two large blinking orange lights 20 feet high and 50 feet apart moving slowly away as we approached.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74289.html|178|ndxe201002| Two large blinking orange lights 20 feet high and 50 feet apart moving slowly away as we approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving home on a cloudy, dark evening on February 2, 2010 on a rural county road we saw two bright orange lights approximately 1 1/2 miles away on what we thought were power company vehicles.  The lights blinked in unison and then separately approximately 2 seconds apart.  They looked to be about 15 feet off the ground and about 50 feet apart.  As we approached the dirt road were they had been hovering, we stopped because the lights were suddenly gone.  The road is a dirt road which intersects our main county road and connects to the next parallel county road 5 miles away.  We looked down the road for any sign of vehicles, head lights or anything that would have explained the lights.  The dirt road has a small power substation adjacent to the beginning of the road which would explain our theory of a power company line truck being parked on the road.  The power tends to go off periodically in our area due to normal winter wind and snow storms so seeing! a line truck is not unusual.  We never saw any other vehicles, so we proceeded towards home again driving approximately 25 miles per hour so we could scan the horizon.  This road is on the west side of a very large alpine valley in Northern California and the line of sight available across the valley at any given time is vast.  The only time vision is obscured is when there is a white-out snow storm or too much fog.  Neither were happening at the time, only a light drizzle of sporadic rain.  After traveling one more mile the lights suddenly reappeared in the same fashion, approximately 20 feet off the ground now, still blinking bright orange and 50 feet from each other.  The lights were in an area well known by both my daughter and I since we have lived across from this particular field for 11 years.  There are no roads and no homes on this land, only alfalfa fields which had approximately 2 feet of snow covering the field at the time.  We drove slowly on the road never ta! king our eyes off the lights and as we approached our road the! lights appeared to have slowly moved away from us in a southerly direction, yet they were still blinking in the same fashion and just as bright.  We stopped on the road right before turning onto our dirt road and watched the lights for a few minutes.  They stopped moving away but continued to blink in a random fashion, sometimes in unison, then separately.  The distance apart never changed and was very steady.  The height of each light was exactly the same.  We didn&#39;t feel anything unusual and we didn&#39;t hear anything unusual.  It was very dark outside so we weren&#39;t able to see if there was any sort of aircraft or shape around the lights.  After we drove up our road we looked back down over the valley and the lights were gone.  From our house we have a view of the entire valley as we live roughly 1/4 mile up a hill on the west side of the valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I returned into the kitchen, I heard the motor from the spa in my backyard turn on.  It does this automatically and I am used to this.  The inside of the house was quiet;  I did not have any appliances on.  The time was around 7:15 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after noticing the spa turn on, I heard a louder, unrecognizable noise that seemed to drown out the otherwise noisy spa motor.  I was curious and mildly alarmed by the unfamiliar noise.  Puzzled after a few seconds and the noise still continuing, I stopped what I was doing (replacing the liner on the kitchen trash can) and opened the patio door a few inches and paused.  I confirmed the noise was from outside.  I quickly stepped outside, and when I was about four-five feet from the house, looking in the direction of the noise, I saw an unidentified object flying low in the sky, above the row of house on my side of the street, moving above the homes along Crisp Avenue, then Klein Avenue toward Flagship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am familiar with how helicopters sound as I used to have a neighbor who owned one and flew it regularly from his home across the street from me.  I was also an EMT and know the sound of helicopters up close as I have loaded patients onto medevac copters.    This object did not sound like a helicopter.  It was too slow to be a plane.  It was hard to determine its shape but it appeared to have at least four lights at opposite points, at/near the craft’s outer perimeter.  The shape of the craft had a ring or circular silhouette.  As it moved in a northerly direction away from me, it stayed very low to the houses and within a few seconds was out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get my iphone the only camera I have - that was in my workbag in my upstairs office.  Hoping to see it and photograph it, I ran downstairs with my iphone, out the front door and out onto the street.  I did not see it, nor could I detect the sound anymore.  I ran back inside and upstairs again, this time to retrieve my wallet.  I jumped into my car and started driving slowly on the streets of Mare Island with the top of my convertible down.  I pulled over to park, look and listen.   Wanting to share my experience, I telephoned my brother’s home, first speaking with my sister-in-law who is a middle school teacher, then with my brother who is a retired police officer like me.  I am 52 years old and of sound mind.  I have never seen a UFO before tonight.<n>

I fell face first on to my bed...I had just finished a shower and had a lavender towel wrapped around me....the dogs were with me........ I found myself flat on the bed face down.  I couldn&#39;t move my body.  Paralyzed.  Something felt like it entered my body...like a lizard or a snake moves....within me.  I was not me...it was inside me and it controlled my thoughts...it wanted me in a fearful state.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of Feb 1 2010 there was a UFO sighting in Ansonia, CT, within the hour of me being attacked.  If you look at the map from a birds eye view-Ansonia looks alot like the Thames river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not afraid.  I am not going to let this event reck my life.  I am not alone in this situation.  Why won&#39;t the United States Government, CIA, FBI-come clean on this?   What is the long term agenda?  The hardest part in all of this is family members think you need a straight jacket.  There&#39;s no way to prove what I went through.  I have talked with the &#34;shrinks&#34; on the high demand of my family.  Of course they can only offer medication.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think I should write a book about it because that might be the only path I can take to know I didn&#39;t just dream all of this.  I know there are other women that have undergone what I went through and there are men too.  When abduction occurs you are paralyzed. You want to scream, hit,s wing, or try to communicate with them-somehow but, all the parts of your body won&#39;t work.  I could close my eyes-that&#39;s it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a sighting a few years ago on 7/23/2005 and reported a triangle shape w/ 6 witnesses.  We had one hour lost time.  So, I feel &#39;THEY&#39; have come back to see me again.  For what I don&#39;t know.  A year has gone by since this Feb. event and it took me over a year to report it.  I&#39;ve had all the test done to me MRI,SCAT SCAN, Blood work....I even had a doctor tell me to seek an exorcist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sorry, I won&#39;t be sucked into the game. There is an agenda people.....I don&#39;t know what it is but, it wanted me to be afraid.... it seems to live on fear.  I will be happy to talk to the people who work for this web sight.<n>

The sky was sunny and clear with no clouds.  We both saw a oval disk shape hovering quite low and it looked 3D.  It was a two toned color tanish/silver with no lights or anything visible on it.  As I proceeded to the bottom of the hill it quickly zoomed off to the left and disapeared.  We have low flying aircraft all year long in this area and I have never seen anything quite like this.  It lasted about a minute and was North-East in the sky.<n>

I believed in them all my life without proof or much mental debate. I just figured we aren&#39;t all that exists and if intervention ever happened, the entities sent would be from a material plane like ours so they&#39;d need vehicles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then one morning around 6 am, I was heading outside to walk my dog. I sat on the bench near the front door to put on my shoes. I heard calm, deep male voice say, “Look to the South.&amp;quot; I wasn&#39;t afraid or even questioned the existence of the voice outside myself but said dismissively, &amp;quot;I don&#39;t even know which way South is.&amp;quot;  The voice said just as calm and repeated, &amp;quot;Look to the South.&amp;quot; I said &amp;quot;OK&amp;quot; and finished putting on my shoes and went outside. I went to the end of my driveway, looked up (which was actually North West but South might have meant up). There was a bright orange star. Brighter than I had ever seen. I thought, &amp;quot;There isn&#39;t a morning star in that direction. Wait is that a star?&amp;quot; and in that second it rushed down toward me and got as big as the sky. Its surface was moving like the sun. I was gold, orange and warm yellow swirling with “energy”. Then the instant I smiled at it in wondrous awe, it shot straight up and out of sight into the outer atmospheres and was gone. It left more North West than its current position so I saw it zip away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Believe it or not, I had no initial response to the event. I turned south and went on my walk. I said out loud, &amp;quot;Gee thanks. “and then said,”  You said HI to me&amp;quot;. But as I walked I kept looking back to that spot in the sky and smiling to myself.  As I walked along I replayed the three minutes over in my head and that is finally when ego began having a conversation with me about it. I wanted to question its purpose, origin, and meaning.  But then realized it was just an acknowledgement of some kind and had no more meaning than those I placed upon it.  I just accepted it as a personal experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next two years were the most trying of my life; a complete destruction of all my ego attachments and ego identifiers.  But whenever I felt very alone, confused, overwhelmed and frightened about the drastic changes occurring around me, I always remembered that I had a nod from whatever is &amp;quot;more&amp;quot; and could gently release my attachment to the outcome of so much change.<n>

I find myself in a very desolate part of New Mexico on Highway 60 heading east.  I am on the road so early because I couldn&#39;t sleep, I am sure with anticipation of the very long drive to Denver ahead of me.  I have driven up to Eager Arizona to see a friend, stay the night and head out the following day.  It was suggested to take 60 because it&#39;s a much prettier drive than Interstate 40.  I had done that so many times, I could drive that in my sleep, a new route was in order.  However, because it was so very dark, I didn&#39;t see much.  The occasional fog patch and lone vehicle heading in the opposite direction.  I could see silouettes of the landscape and there was snow on the ground that dimly luminated my surroundings.  I was awake.  Very awake.  Just finished a large cup of coffee, listening to Sirius stand-up comedy (satellite radio) and driving very fast 75-85 mph.  I was alone on this road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Judging from some of the signs I had passed, I thought I was coming up on a small town and slowed down a bit.  I started to gain on a mini van and decided to hold back and not pass until we went through the town.  Being the kind of driver I am, I am constantly looking at my surroundings.  Both side mirrors, rear view mirror and of course, straight ahead.  Not coming up on any town and I start to think about passing the van.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I look in my driver side mirror and there is suddenly a vehicle directly behind me, only more toward the center of the two lane highway than in my lane.  As if it were thinking about passing me.  I&#39;m thinking, what the...I did not see anything in the distance, had not gone around any curves, nothing obscured my view of several miles behind or in front of me.  I did not pass any roads either for somebody to get on to the highway.  My first impression other than how freakishly close it was to my tailgate, was that is was the grill of an older model 80&#39;s, boxy Chevy truck.  I never saw a truck, just what I have illustrated on my drawing.  It was directly, 3 - 4 FEET behind me.  We are traveling at maybe 75 mph. .. I&#39;m thinking, pass me buddy.  I look in my rearview, see only the lights (not all of them), side view, looks like it wants to go around.  I move to the right to indicate he is cleared for passing. Look again, it&#39;s right on me, look forward to make sure I am not too close to the van which is at a very safe distance, then look back to see where it is.  It vanished.  I even slowed down to look behind me to see where it went, no dust from going off the road, we did not pass a road to turn (going to fast and it was far too close to me to make a sudden turn), there were no ditches, no tail lights behind...nothing.  Just gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I wasn&#39;t thinking UFO, but I thought the grill was odd and the lights weren&#39;t the average color or placement. Why didn&#39;t I see the shape of  the truck I thought it was?  Why were the main headlights a soft orange and why was there more than one turn signal light? Honestly, I did not see the whole thing, just what I could see in my drivers side mirror at a very close range.  There is no way it could have come up so fast without me seeing it.  I was going very fast and was on the lookout..(I didn&#39;t want a ticket for speeding).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it was gone, my mirror was really dirty, foggy, I rolled the window down and tried to wipe it clean. It wouldn&#39;t clean up, just smear. AND, I felt a tremendous need to sleep. I could not keep my eyes open.  I rolled the windows down, thinking the cold air would keep me awake until the sun came up.  Didn&#39;t help so much.  I fought it and finally came upon a very small town just as the sun started to come up.  I pulled over, where there were several buildings and some activity and gathered my thoughts.  At first, I thought maybe it was a ghost truck, don&#39;t laugh.  I did think that.  Then as I drove on it occurred to me Roswell was just over the mountain range...really??  could it be??  It all really struck me as bizarre, the way it happened. The rate of speed, how it suddenly appeared, how close it was to my truck and the way the &#34;truck grill&#34; looked, not quite right..and, how it suddenly vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Do I report this?  If so, to who?  As I showered, I checked for any weird marks..you just never know.<n>
