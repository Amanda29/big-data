11/25/58 23:00|Milwaukee|WI|Disk|10 seconds|3 disk shaped lights swerving among each other across sky, got to North, shot straight into the stars|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84835.html|1|ndxe195811| 3 disk shaped lights swerving among each other across sky, got to North, shot straight into the stars<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself, my brother, and a neighborhood friend of ours were in our backyard looking at the stars with one of those old Gilbert cardboard tube reflector telescopes.  I actually did an ink drawing of the event and submitted it to Coast to Coast’s website, which they posted.  My brother is three years younger than I.  When we saw this I must have been around ten.  I don’t know if he would fill out a form like this.  I’d really like to know his blow by blow recollection.  What’s funny is that when I got onto Facebook, before that we hadn&#39;t talked to each other in almost twenty years (for whatever reason).  We got all caught up in two days (score one for Facebook).  One of the first things I asked him was if he remembered the night in the backyard when we saw the three UFOs?  I may have been living with an hallucination my whole life.  He told me – Yeah, he remembered it and he thinks about it all the time.  That night has convinced me there is something going on.! I’ve been pro-space and a Trekkie (to a point) my entire life.  I’m now 62 and actually I have been diagnosed with MDS which has really taken me out of the game, it’s a pre-leukemia, may need a bone marrow transplant.  I have a younger brother that already said he would do it if it came to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Being that my mortality is staring me in the face, I feel like I have to get all this stuff in me – out of me, before I won’t be able to any longer.  I just heard the program on Coast to Coast tonight where you asked to send all this stuff in.  Here’s my two-cents. My Uncle gave me the telescope for my birthday.  It was in November and a cold clear night, but ya gotta try it out.  We took turns looking through it, and I’m sure we saw nothing we could comprehend.  What happened: is that we heard a noise like the sound of a jet aircraft, but we couldn’t see it yet.  We knew it was coming from the East which were houses and trees.  I had an idea to maybe see if I can see the jet in the telescope, close up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What came over the tops of the trees however, where these three classic disks.  They glowed enough that they were obvious.  At arm’s length, maybe the size of a silver dollar between finger and thumb.  What I’ll never forget (if that wasn’t enough), was that they were swerving in and out of each other; like playing, easy as you please, absolutely in control, dancing around each other.  They came over the trees,  came across the sky (clear-starry), maybe 45-50 degrees above the horizon line, which we could not see for the neighborhood houses and trees.  They went across the sky, swerving in and out of each other, go to about where North is and shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  We forgot about the damn telescope, we were too dumfounded.  I remember running into the house to tell my mother (who was watching television) that we just saw flying saucers in the backyard.  She straight out didn’t believe us.  Why should she?  Not the same night, and I know I was still a kid.  My mother sat under the street light on our front porch, waiting for my father to come home (he worked late as a chef in a restaurant).  This could have been 1 am.  She was alone (yes under a street light at night, dark streets, in inner town Milwaukee – those days are long gone).  Anyway, she swears she heard the sound of a freight train, come from the East going to the West and it was in the sky over the top of houses in the neighborhood.  She curled up to protect herself – I cannot recollect if the same instance is when she said she saw something that was &#34;cigar&#34;-shaped.  After it was gone (the noise) she said she saw a smoke trail, extend from the East to the West, being blown South from a wind from the North.  It was low enough for the street lights to reflect off it.  I can’t recall where I heard about-shaped UFOs that sounded like a locomotive?   You’re preaching to the choir.<n>
11/15/58 22:30|Greenville|RI|Disk|ax. 10 min.|Five small disk or spherical-shaped objects merging with a large saucer-shaped object observed by three whitnesses in 1958.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42368.html|2|ndxe195811| Five small disk or spherical-shaped objects merging with a large saucer-shaped object observed by three whitnesses in 1958.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the fall of 1958 or 59, when I was in Junior High School, the following was observed by both of my parents and myself: We were living at 21 West Approach Terrace Drive, in Greenville, R.I. Our property was located on the North to North-west shore of Slacks Reservoir. It was the late fall of the year. The time was between 1030 and 1100 (EST). We saw a bright light through the southern facing windows of our living room. We went outside and observed an object in the sky that was either large enough or close enough to obscure approximately 60 to 70% of the sky to the South west. It was at an azmuth of about 70 degrees. The object was shaped like two dinner plates placed top to top; a narrow glowing yellow-green band was separating the two halves, and a red spot, about three times the width of the band was located on the same seam as the band. The object itself was a glowing silvery-white. It slowly rotated on the horizontal axis, until it was almost round in shape. At that time five smaller objects, appearing to be round or spherical, approached from what appeared to be radial directions, and merged with the larger object. At that time, the object continued to rotate on the same axis as before, a yellow-green light was emitted from the lower rimmed area of the double plate in a fan-like beam. In the space of less than ten seconds the object had vanished into the South-West in an increasing angle of azmuth. There was absolutely no sound at all during the entire episode.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That evening, several radio stations reported that the object had been picked up on the RADAR at the primary commercial airport. The next day, nothing was on the radio or television, or in the newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drew a picture of the object and wrote a letter to the Astronomy department at Brown University. My parents and I all signed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a week later we heard a droaning of engines in the sky to the South-West, a dark object was approaching over the water. When the object was very close, bilboard lights flashed the message across the blimp &#34;Hello Down There.&#34; Just how gullable did they think we were!!!  About two weeks after I had sent the letter we received a response. Supposedly we had seen the planet Jupiter and five of its moons with the unaided eye, taking up an area the size of a large serving platter, with the &#34;moons&#34; being about the size of a nickel each, in the wrong part of the sky, and at the wrong azmuth. Once again, just how dumb did they think we were!!!  My I.Q. has been tested to between 160 and 180 on various tests. At the time of the incident I had already built an analog computer, radio equipment, and my own telescope. I was already interested in a number of scientific fields. I firmly believe that we wittnessed a UFO mother ship and five scouts, and that rediculous attempts at cover-up were made by or influenced by the government of the United States.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.
