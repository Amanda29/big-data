They were red, green and white. It was dusk and I could see no structure but the lights abutted one another in a triangular format.  When first sighted, it was motionless.  It then suddenly descended straight down at a VERY high speed.  I assumed that I would hear a crash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute or so later, it ascended to the precise same spot. It hovered there for a minute or so, then repeated the same rapid descent.  I did not see it again.  No sound and no other sighting. I did not get any any video or photos.  There was no trail.  The entire event was about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will do some checking for others who may have seen it.  It descended and ascended so fast that it was hard to believe.  No acceleration.  From zero to full speed instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, at that time of day, others would have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will report back if I find any corroborating reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>
