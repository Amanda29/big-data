I was 12 or 13-years-old, and my father was having a New Year&#39;s Eve Party at his house. One of the guests had two boy&#39;s about my age, so we were playing outside as young boys do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father lives in a subdivision atop a hill in a culdesac surrounded by woods. As we were playing in the culdesac, we began to see strange lights at the bottom of the hill in the woods. I remeber atleast two sets of them. They were white and moved back and forth for atleast 30 to 45 minutes. The trees obstructed our line of sight, so all we could only see the glow of the lights some 200 yards away, and not what was causing them. We urged the adults to come outside and look, to which they resonded in typical adult fashion for us to go along and keep playing our little games.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we returned outside the lights were still there. Even in my pre-teens, I was quite the open minded individual. So, I dedcided we should try and communicate with them. By this point the two other boys with me were becoming quite scared, yet I was relaxed.We stood in the culdesac and I literally said, &#34;If there is something out there give us a sign.&#34; Nothing happened, at first. We had been outside in the cold December night for nearly an hour, and the others really wanted to go in at this point. But I urged them to wait just a few more minutes. Once again, I said, &#34;If there is something out there, give us a sign.&#34; Immediately following my second request, a bright &#34;star&#34; lit up in the apex of the sky directly above us. Though looking towards the woods, when the &#34;star&#34; appeared we all three simutaneously looked up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;star&#34; shot down from the sky, followed by a tail, and struck a wooded, rather large hill about a mile from our vantage point. It was silent- no boom when it hit- yet it cast the most brilliant display of colors I have ever seen across half of the horizon in that direction. The colors bloomed upward from where the &#34;star&#34; hit. I remember alot of green, red and orange. From the moment I asked for a sign for the second time up until the display of colors vanished was probablly only 10 to 15 seconds. But, without a doubt, the most memorable 15 seconds of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this happened, even I was a little spooked. I in no way expected such an awe inspiring response. Needless to say, we all ran back inside and did not return to the culdesac again that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sure someone else had to have seen this, but heard nothing. I was young, yet read the paper and watched the news for several days afterwards and found nothing about the explosion of color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About four years ago I ran into one of the boys that were with me. I mentioned to him the peculiar New year&#39;s Eve incident and he acted kind of like I was crazy. he literally forgotten- or subconciously omitted- the experience from his memory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and have found him to be exceptionally credible.  This is one of two reports submitted by the same witness.  The date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Slowed  van  down  to  a  stop  and  switched  off  engine ( common  thing  to  do  as  a  UFO  Investigator). Observed  this  incredible  large  star  for  perhaps  a  minute  more,  then  without  any  other  present  phenomena  visible  the  star  went  out!  Not  unlike  watching  a  house  light-bulb  being  switched  off. I  then  wound  down  the  drivers  side-window  to  see  any  other  action  or  phenomena  which  might  occur. I  was  suddenly  rewarded  thus, &#34; within  a  few  minutes  a  large  oval  shaped  craft  appeared  directly  above  me, approx  eighty-feet  in  the  air. I  observed  it  &#34;quite  clearly&#34; neither  afraid  nor  shaken  through  the  opened  window. The  length  was  approx  forty-feet  and  from  the  base  to  the  dome  shaped  aperture  at  its  top  it  was  ten-feet.  The  craft/object  was  moving  forward  at  less  than  5mls  per-hour. The  colour  was  a  dull  rusty-red  not  unlike  metal  looks  after  being  removed  from  a  forge  or  furnace  and  cooling  down. As  I  watched  a  rotation  of  orange  lights  or  ports  moved  around the  base  of  the  ship in a  anti-clock  direction. And  immediately  on  this  happening  I  clearly  saw  a  portal  or gateway  being  &#34;opened&#34;  into  spacetime  or  dimensional  time? the  space  immediately  in  front  of  the  craft  shaking  like  a  giant-mirror,  and  thence  the  craft  moved  slowly  into  this  created  portal  and  vanished. Obviously  the  star  first  observed  was  not  a  star  but  an  opened  portal,  and  the  orange-port  exhaust  light  was  emitting  a  unknown  field  of  energy  to  transpose  matter  and  open  a  new  gateway  from   earths  gravitational  matrix. (I  have  encountered  other  craft  at  less  than  ! twenty-f eet  away, both  cases  in  the  year  1983) and  a  clearer  more  precise  report  of  the  above  oval  craft was  given  to  MUFON. the  above  account  must  not  be  misconstrued  as  any  other  object  but  a  UFO! I  have  always  been  available  for  any  scientific  scrutiny/tests  to  prove  my  encounters  as  FACT.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
12/15/92 20:45|Elkland|MO|Oval|about 15 minutes|I was followed by an oval shaped object for several miles and it took off rapidly after I shined a spotlight on it.|6/23/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75763.html|5|ndxe199212| I was followed by an oval shaped object for several miles and it took off rapidly after I shined a spotlight on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of December 15, 1992, I left Marshfield, MO and was going to visit a friend who lived just outside Elkland, MO.  As I was crossing the I-44 overpass at Exit 100, I noticed a bright gold colored light to my left.  It appeared to be no more than 100 feet off the ground and less than a mile west of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hundreds of people reported sightings of mysterious lights in the nighttime sky in the vicinity of Northview, MO (I-44 exit 96) in 1992, and I personally saw lights from a distance many times myself, and spoke to others who saw things up close, but this was by far the closest I had ever been to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I traveled west on Missouri Highway 38 toward Elkland, I kept watching this object.  The farther I traveled, the closer it got to me and no matter which direction I was traveling, it was always at my 10 oâ€™clock position.  This was very unusual given the fact there were several 90 degree curves on this highway.  I could sense that I was being watched by whoever or whatever was in control of this object.  When it got to within a quarter mile of me, I decided to stop and look at it with my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made a left turn onto Conklin Road, stopped and turned off my headlights and engine.  The object also stopped directly over Conklin Road about 1,000 feet west of me.  It was about 50 feet above the ground, totally motionless and soundless.  It was oval shaped and about 25 feet in diameter and approximately 12 feet from top to bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With my binoculars, I viewed the object for about 2 to 3 minutes.  It was the same color as yellow gold jewelry and had several black dots scattered randomly on it.  It also had a tiny bit of red on the very top I could only see with the binoculars.  It definitely was not a red light and it did not blink or strobe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The temperature that night was around 15 degrees.  I donâ€™t know if this had anything to do with it, but I could see a distortion around the object similar to what you would see rising from and asphalt highway on a hot summer day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The car I was driving was equipped with a spotlight.  While standing there looking at the object, I decided to aim the spotlight at it and turn it on and off a couple times to see what, if anything might happen.  After carefully aiming the spotlight toward the object, I turned the switch on and off twice in rapid succession.  As I was turning the light off the second time, without a sound, the object went straight west and was completely out of sight in less than a second.  This was the last time I saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was really strange about this was the fact the object did not start at zero miles per hour and gradually increase its speed, but instantly went from zero directly to something like 2 or 3 thousand miles per hour without creating a sonic boom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  One of several seemingly high-quality reports from the same source, who describes himself as a public employee, who had a great deal of responsibility.  We suspect tha the witness is a very good observer.  PD))<n>
12/15/92 20:00|Fairview (Scott County)|VA|Disk|5 to 8 minutes|Two saucer-like objects with lights floating along a valley seen by two witnesses, went up the mountain and disappeared.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42937.html|6|ndxe199212| Two saucer-like objects with lights floating along a valley seen by two witnesses, went up the mountain and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until I had the conversations noted below, I had supposed that UFOs were certainly the figment of overactive but in some cases quite honest imaginations.  I&#39;m still not totally convinced of the reality of UFOs, but I am not now as sure of my original assumption because I have good reason to believe these two women told the truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire text of my notes (with names deleted as you requested)is submitted for whatever benefit it might be to your pursuits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two individuals below that I interviewed had no objection to this information being made public.  They are both now living at the exact spot where the sighting occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> INTERVIEWS  During a conversation in early February 1993, a neighbor of my mother mentioned that she and her daughter had seen two flying saucers.  At that time, she seemed so unperturbed about the sighting that I more or less dismissed it as a subject of light and probably negligible conversation.  When she later mentioned it again I became more interested and asked if she would mind going into the sighting in more detail and if I could take notes on the answers she might give to my questions.  She readily agreed and said that her daughter would no doubt be glad to do the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below are interview notes I made on April 25, 1993 with the mother, followed by interview notes with her daughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.  The mother came out of her house with her daughter, looked up and saw the 2 spacecraft.	 	2.	She called the daughter&#39;s attention to them saying excitedly &#34;What are those things?&#34; 	3.	Daughter answered, &#34;Mommy, what are those things?&#34; 	4.	Two UFO&#39;s, each looking like two saucers with their outer rims fitted together, flyingâ€”floating just over the house, one in front of the other, down the slight valley and up the opposite valley to the top of the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.	Lights on the edge of he craft, clear lights, blinking off and on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6.	No noise, no smoke, no markings on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7.	No seams, no doors, no windowsâ€”no apertures visible on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8.	Could not have been a zeppelin or (weather) balloons or helicopter she was sure of that.  She knew very well what each of these craft would have looked like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9.	The two women (husband/father had gone to bed early) had probably, she recalls, been watching TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10.	Not sure of the date or even the month, but weather was cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11.	No wind, no dogs barking and no background noises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12.	Craft seemed to ignore them, oblivious to their presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 13.	Did not speed up; did not turn off (until later), took no evasive action.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 14.	They climbed the mountain at constant height, did not bob or weave or speed up or slow down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 15.	Stars were shining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 16.	Turned sharply left, still one behind the other, and finally disappeared behind the trees on top of the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Copy of my notes made during the interview with the daughter at my temporary home in Virginia 4 27 93.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1.	Cold weatherâ€”looked like two plates or saucers put togetherâ€”this happened two or three years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2.	No (outside/yard) security light; no porch light was on; TV might have been on; no noises; no dogs (barking).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3.	Went through gateâ€”starsâ€”coldâ€”looked upâ€”saw them before her mother did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4.	Over the houseâ€”twice as high as houseâ€”maintained altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5.	(Moving at) 5 miles per hourâ€”fast walk (speed) 	6.	Dark grayâ€”dull grayâ€”not shining 	7.	Lights one colorâ€”didn&#39;t flashâ€”orange and red (orange red).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8.	In a row (one behind the other)â€”big thingsâ€”6 feet tall man could easily stand up in one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9.	Man could stand up in its center (highest part).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10.	Lightsâ€”just lightsâ€”no &#34;headlights&#34; effect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11.	Wasn&#39;t spinning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 12.	Can&#39;t recall (detailed distinction between) bottom/top (of craft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 13.	Heard no noise at all (from craft).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 14. 	Wasn&#39;t a blimp; she fully knew what a blimp looks like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 15.	Has ridden in a balloonâ€”this was no balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 16.	One solid light was on the edge.  Edge appeared to be lit up all round but more intense at some pointsâ€”(my interpretation of what she said).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 17.	Thirty seconds to the top of the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 18.	Turned and staying in row (one behind the other as they turned leftâ€”see below).<n> <n><n> <n><n> 19.	Could see just the shape of the lights (lighted configuration) at top of the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 20. 	Had seen TV and read about UFOs of this same shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 21.	Bottom and top (of craft) sameâ€”looked the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 22.	Smooth; dull gray in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 23.	Dogs didn&#39;t bark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 24.	Went over the other side of mountain after left turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 25.	Surface reflected lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 26.	Thought they (craft) were mannedâ€”assumed they were manned but did not feel she was actually being observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 27.	After 90 degree turn at top of ridge (mountain) they stayed in row and gradually disappeared on the other side as they followed the road out to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At my request,  (who has had some basic art training) drew a craft which resembles a smooth bottom, inverted bowl with the bottom of the craft convex but much more shallow than the top.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additional notes I made after initial discussions with Gladys Wells 	a.	Different colored lights blinked around the edges   (changed this to say some clear lights&#34; in interview of 4-26-93).<n> <n><n> <n><n> b. 	Each craft looked like two bowls or two dinner plates placed together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> c.	Top rounded, slick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> d.	Floated; floating (words used several times).<n> <n><n> <n><n> e.	Noise (no motor, no exhaust, no sounds of any kind) 	f.	Over the house; up the hollow/valley, turned left at top of ridge, following road out the ridge, (300 feet altitude?) and disappeared behind the tree line.  No seams, no doors, no windows noted in the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO INFO All thoughts below are premised primarily upon the accuracy of one sightingâ€”by a neighbor and her daughterâ€”, who, I believe, told the truth; who saw essentially what they think they saw, as detailed in the interview information given me in April l993.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Own Scattered Thoughts Written Not Long After The Above Interviews Were Made  The various sightings of UFOs have never been really photographed; that is to say: They have never been irrefutably photographed in a journalistic sense.  Reportedly, UFOs of one description or another have been followed by pursuit planes and in such cases got away fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These ships have to be very valuable (vulnerable, however, to damage) or very secretive (shy).  Why?  Is this to protect themselves, their civilization or is it to protect us from a knowledge that we cannot handle?  Which suggests that they are either manned (which seems unlikely) or mechanically manned, or, more likely, guided (monitored) from central points or from light years away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed, the quiet energy, the flawless navigation, (possibly) unlimited source of power or ability to cross dimensions or cross/change time zones at will.  All this suggests an intelligence capable of controlling earth, supervising it, intervening in any or all events, studying it as an earth scientist would study a &#34;primitive&#34; garden or exotic laboratory culture; earth being merely a thing of abiding curiosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where do &#34;they&#34; come from?  They would &#34;come&#34; from a time and speed derivation that we, at this point, are not capable of comprehending, or perhaps of accepting.  Which means that human, conventional thinking and reasoning have not been able to even scratch the surface.  If they are that intelligent, that powerful, and if they care about our world, what form does their &#34;intervention&#34; take?  Why don&#39;t they help us solve our problems?  Because this would render us dependent on them and our evolution would cease.  Our efforts would cease; our life would be meaningless?  This recalls the aborigines of Australia and natives of New Guinea whose cultures/lives were ruined by exposure to modern civilization.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are we talking about a supreme being(s) here?  Which brings us back to the same pointâ€”life, thought painful, hard and often apparently futileâ€”there has to be a &#34;purpose&#34; by a &#34;higher definition&#34; that to this point at least, has for the most part (except theologically or emotionally) escaped us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How do weâ€”can weâ€”should we tryâ€”to get in touch with them?  If they are as superior as it appears, they will get in touch with us only when and if they are readyâ€”which may be never.<n> <n><n> <n><n> RIDDLE:  If these craft (UFOs) have been here or have visited earth for thousands of years, one must wonder if they have ceased to evolve, to make progress.  â€”Or, another possibilityâ€”that these craft come from so far in deep space that this is a one-time space probe and these craft were programmed to stay here, study earth and possibly other planets and send back their information over a period of thousands or millions of years.  In other words, they may be marooned relics of a long since disappeared and obsolete civilization and are now captives of their own programmed mission with nowhere to goâ€”doomed to &#34;probe&#34; forever with no one at home to listen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no way to &#34;communicate&#34; with these ships in a humanly traditional or personal way if the above hypothesis is reasonably accurate.  However, if they are programmed for contact (such as by maneuvering with lights or responding to signals of various kinds) or making some response to certain stimuli, then some kind of communication seems possible but perhaps very limited.  â€”Perhaps not more than a friendly, patronizing responseâ€”much like a human could communicate with a dolphin in the wild.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another possibility is that these ships were sent here years ago under a space exploration program that has (1) performed its mission (2) the civilization that launched it no longer exists or because of evolutionary process no longer cares (3) has lost control or contact with these ships (4) that these probes will continue indefinitelyâ€”much like our &#34;primitive&#34; probes that were sent into outer space to wander for eternity among the stars and through the great expanse.  But, if this (no. 4) is true, the technology that powers and programs these craft is so advanced that we are millions of years behind the creators of such machines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this brings up a point of logic.  It is difficult to avoid edging over into theology here.  Is it possible that these space machines are not only space &#34;probes&#34; from another, far-advanced, civilization millions of light years away (as we measure itâ€”with our limitations) but are, in fact, machines that constantly monitor the meteorological, cosmological and seismological status of earth as well as all other human/non-human factors that influence life on earth?  In other words, are we a &#34;laboratory&#34; or simply an intriguing but relatively primitive place in the universe that some &#34;force&#34; some super intelligence, for some reason perhaps unfathomable by our primitive logic sees fit to perpetuate?  The difficulty in knowing or even approaching the answer to this is that our logic as compared with the logic of our benefactors (or tormentors as the case may be) would have to be so inferior that we cannot begin to even form a workable hypothesisâ€”or can we?  Is it possible that we are one of these: (a) a place where we are sent (recycled) to &#34;learn&#34; something that would help us in a higher civilization somewhere else?  (2) A place where we are sent as a form of punishment (boot camp or even &#34;purgatory&#34;) or rehabilitation as having been unfit for where we were before?  (3) Are we, in fact, as far as our feeble logic can grasp it, in some kind of hell?  â€”For what purpose?  (The question that immediately arises here is how can we superimpose our definition of purpose upon an infinitely higher intelligenceâ€”after all, it was man within the past several hundred thousand years who invented the concept and word &#34;purpose&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n> If these UFOs do exist in the form and behavior that I&#39;m beginning to believe they might, then the apparent, often presumed, meaninglessness of life on earth comes into question.  The theological explanation for the purpose of life would, in a sense, be verified though the details or description, at least of one level or dimension of authority or power, of the structure would be only vaguely correct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The prime question here is: Can we reasonably expect that the intelligence behind these &#34;machines&#34; will ever make themselves comprehensively manifest to us.  (Or, like Godâ€”the infiniteâ€”would it be literally impossible by definition?)  How far will we have to advance for this to happen?  What would it do to the human world if it did happen?  Would life, as we know it, become even more meaningless?  Would we become dependent (economically and emotionally) and thus so disillusioned that we would cease to be a &#34;civilization&#34;? â€“Or would the communication with this intelligence simply confirm the existence of Godâ€”the infinite?  Then, where would faith go? â€”And what would that do to us?  In other words, if we literally know that an &#34;infinite&#34; force exists and interacts with humanity, how would that knowing affect us?  Are we ready for it?  That is the question that this superior intelligenceâ€”if it is as benevolent or caring or at least not destructively hostileâ€”as it certainly appears not to beâ€”can apparently already answer and will not let itself be &#34;known&#34; until the right time comesâ€”if ever!  These craft seem to have definite form and substanceâ€”to be of metallic (or other durable) derivative, and the strobe lights, that are apparently of different colors and blink in some methodical or rhythmic order, appear to be for some purpose other than illumination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (a)	They have not been observed through another objectâ€”for example &#34;like a ghost&#34; passing through trees, mountains, buildings, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (b)	They seem to &#34;escape&#34; hurriedly only when close contact is made or pursuit is attempted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another possible facet: Is it possible that the appearance, behavior, existence of these craft do not depend upon the nature of these beings or upon their advanced technology, but in fact, derives from the very nature of the universeâ€”time as related to spaceâ€”of which concept we are so primeval in understanding?  Could it be, therefore, that what we are seeing is not the flying machines from some distant planet, but is a fleeting manifestation of a &#39;spiritual&#39; (for lack of a better term) realm about which we have no comprehensionâ€”much like a dung beetle who happens to be at the edge of an airport runway?  The beetle feels the vibration of the airplaneâ€™s engines, glimpses the craft in motion but hasn&#39;t the slightest thought, nor could he ever have, as to what kind of people made the craft or for what purpose it is flown.  In fact, such concepts are beyond the beetleâ€™s comprehension.  It is anathema to the ego, but I rather think that as related to the intelligence of UFOs as we begin to imagine them to be, we human beings are still at the dung beetle stage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not as far-fetched as it may sound.  Imagine that there are populated planets by the millions or billions, and that some or all of them are millennia older than our planet and the conditions of their environments were such as to promote intelligence at several times the speed of ours.  No mathematical formula is necessary to conclude that such civilizations would long ago have learned to travel, or to send spacecraft, at the speed of light or perhaps even several million times faster.  Their kind of &#39;travel&#39; might be so advanced that distance has long since been conquered, and that &#34;time&#34; is only a force to be taken advantage of, not to be handicapped by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But all the theories, all the possibilities, and all the fantasies mean little more than interesting exercises, until we can break into this new frontier with our brains.  The problem obviously is: As we now perceive the universe, it seems to be a stacked deck.  You can advance only in a &#34;straight line&#34; and can go no faster or no farther than the human mind can deal with.  For example, had a cave man family of five suddenly stepped through a curtain onto the deck of a modern aircraft carrier, the effect for that family would no doubt be quite dramatic, if not mentally unmanageable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems just as logical to begin with &#34;what these UFOs are not, as with what they actually are.  They are not: (1) Manned [[in the sense that little green men are inside]].  (2) Hostile, certainly in the short term.  If it were otherwise, we would have long since been made toast.  (3) Not intrusive.  This would have already become manifest in their behavior.  (3) Particularly concerned about what we think of them.  â€“If so, they could certainly avoid detection altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In fact, it seems that they are aloof, or perhaps more accurately, totally detached, as if the brains behind their being here, are either no longer in existence or are so much in advance of us that our existence is no more than dolphins to a cruise liner.  The one possible (and chilling) exception to this might be that these craft have a far more sinister mission.  â€“That they are fully equipped to manipulate the earth&#39;s inhabitants through mind control, much like experimental animals in a laboratory.  â€“Which brings up another intriguing dimension to this subject.  Is it not possible that these craft were responsible for the experimental seeding of earth with a hybrid, some sort of a cross between themselves and earth animals such as the ape several millennia in the past?  Could they not now be monitoring our progress and therefore have a personal interest in whether or not we are capable of advancing on the ladder of successful evolution?  Could their mission be simply a matter of scientific curiosity, a kind of space gardening project, a seeding of the various, infinite number of planets in all the solar systems with varieties of species for purposes so far above our intelligence that we could never begin to comprehend? 	I am inclined to believe that there have been no human contacts whatsoever; that there have been no encounters of the third kind, and that with the exception of simple chance sightings, all the rest of the UFO stories are pure baloney.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All this brings us back to where we began: An intelligence capable of traveling through time or sending space ships through time, or through space at the speed of light or even infinitely faster, would not, it seems to me, have the slightest interest in our terribly primitive existence.  The one possible exception might be that we do show some promise of progressing technologically to a point where we would eventually have to be made a part of that vast network of intelligence.  â€“Or we would become a sufficient nuisance in space travel or space communications that we would have to be severely dealt with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Or could it be that there is some benevolent power behind these visitations to earthâ€”that our planet or solar system is monitored, and cared for as an exotic but isolated garden, a thing of curiosity that is protected like we would protect endangered species?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I could see it plain as day in front of me|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32760.html|7|ndxe199212| It came up through the trees and had red lights spaced around it. I could see it plain as day in front of me<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the last day of hunting season in Mass. i was waiting on my grandmother&#39;s steps for it to lighten up a little so i could hunt. She has 110 acres in Lenox, Ma. I was just looking around when i noticed what seemed to be red flashing lights in the trees. I kept watching and it was moving upwards. This saucer came straight up. It didn&#39;t have flashing lights but stable red lights kinda spaced out around the disk. It&#39;s hard for me to tell you how big it was or how far. It was pretty big though. This is not a case of just &#34;seeing&#34; something in the sky. It was , as plain as day, right spack dab in front of me, a complete flying saucer. I didn&#39;t know what to do. I mean, i was scared but also excited a the same time. i then heard a car coming down the road. I began running towards the road. It&#39;s very hard to explain what I was thinking. I was planning on flagging down the car but decided against. A man in full camo with a gun before 6am jumping out in front of a stranger yelling &#34;flying saucer, flying saucer&#34; I would&#39;ve probably run myself over and not looked back. Anyway, i stopped running towards the road and headed back to the steps. It was still there but looked like it moved a little west. It then moved down like it was going to land or something. I watched as hard as i could. It didn&#39;t land but moved low to the ground back to where i saw it first. It came up in the same spot i saw it the first time. This time while rising above the trees, it seemed to have trouble and looked like it wobbled on its way up. Then there it was again directly in front of me, clearing the trees, it just hovered therefor about 20 seconds i guess, and poof. Like a snap of your fingers it was gone. It literly left a streak of red in the sky. I know some may be reading this thinking that i&#39;m crazy. My friends even said the same thing! But when i insisted that a bunch of us go out there and walk a straight line through the woods they knew i was DEAD serious. And we did. There was probably 15 of us and found nothing at all. I was hoping for burned grass or something. I mean it had to have been landed back there . Hell, i don&#39;t know. Listen it was the LAST day of shotgun season in Mass in 92. Wish i knew the exact day. I will find out.  I believe that someone else HAD to have seen it. They just had to!  My grandmother&#39;s property borders the Lenox sportman&#39;s club. I was hoping that when i searched &#34;sightings by the state&#34; i would see one in there around the same time on the same day. Who knows, maybe someone will contact me with the same sighting. I really hope so. You wanna know something funny? I went to the library immediately after my sighting and got a few books. Of course everybody&#39;s first question was,&#34;what did it look like?&#34; In the book, UFO&#39;s and how to see them, there is the same exact saucer i saw in that book. If anyone is interested in contacting me please do. ((e-address deleted))   Thank you!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

But i have now decided to tell our story.Three of us saw this happen.We were not drunk or drugged or insane at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked about the size of a small cottage,we were mystified as we new the feilds were empty,we then decided to drive over to investigate,this meant leaving the feild we were in,driving along a track then into the feild where the object was.(I forgot to say that we could only see the top two thirds of the object from the original feild.) Now here is the strange thing,i think i can remember turning the 4+4 into the feild, the next thing i can clearly remember is that we were back lamping for rabbits. The other strange thing is that after that night i forgot what had happened,it was about 5yrs later before i started to remember the incident,I did not tell anyone what happened in case they thought i had a screw loose! Eventualy i told my wife and she persuaded me to talk to my freind about it, when i eventualy managed to broach the subject he could not remember anything about it.This left me feeling quite upset as i new by now that i had not imagined it,Then about a year later he told me he could now remember seeing the sphere shining in the feild but nothing after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was driving home to Exeter, NH from Kittery ME.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was between 9-10pm and it was a clear cold New England evening. I was driving westbound on 101 (in Exeter) just before reaching the (Newfields Rd.) exit. I was traveling approx. 56 miles per hour but slowing down to approach my exit. This area of 101 was not populated at the time and my exit dumps into a typical NH country road. There was no traffic behind me but a car up ahead some distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just before my turn I noticed three white lights above the tree line ahead (west) on 101.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slowed down  noticing they were lined up next to one another( in a row). As my exit grew closer the diamond shaped light furthest to the right shot straight up and disappeared. The one next to it turned a bit stopped and hung there a moment then flew off in a different direction ( to the left)and the last one went  to it&#39;s left and also dissapeared from view. I had a passenger with me and we both saw it and looked at eachother after the event. I have told one other person this story.(My wife) I hope you enjoyed my recollection of this event. Not sure what I saw but I figured you people would appreciate this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for reading this.  ((name deleted))<n>

It was just after work and it was dark. I was the last one to leave, as it often happenned. i was a mechanic at the time, specialized in electronic transmissions, engine rebuilding and electronic fuel injection systems.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, i&#39;m sitting in my car, waiting for my engine to warm up because it was quite cold that night. I looked at Mount St-Bruno, with its lit ski Hill and at the highway coming out of Montreal to my left. To my right was the Dealership where i worked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, just in front and above the garage, i would say 75yards in front of me and 150feet in the air, there was what looked like 3 large redish flood lights hanging in mid air, i looked at them for about a minute, i looked for the helicopter that should have been carrying these lights, but no, there was nothing i could see. I decided to get out of the car to listen for any sounds, i could hear the traffic on the highway at about 100 yards to my left, but nothing from what had now become 1 large redish light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it started moving directly toward the ski hill.  When it got close to the hill, it turned west, towards Montreal following the lenght of the mountain when all of a sudden it was just a flashlight size glow, turned 180 degrees and went back over the ski slope. Now this is what blew my mind, i could see the hill behind the glow.  Well it passed beetween two light poles on the hill, went in to the woods an vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Couldn&#39;t sleep that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was driving allong, when i noticed something in the sky. There wen&#39;t many clouds around and this looked like a funny shaped cloud. I know this sounds unconvincing but it had the shape of the Enterprise, from star trek. I thought what could that be. I was staring at it trying to figure out what it was, it wasnt dark, it was getting near twilight. Then all of a sudden it kind of flashed off and was gone. I yelled at my mum and sister to see if they saw it, but they were too busy looking at the country side<n>

The object appeared without sound, jumped to two different locations and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was approximately the size of two 747&#39;s one on top of the other and had muted lights going around the center of it, in this sequence red, yellow, green,blue.The object made no sound and hovered for about 10 seconds, jumped to another location for about 2 seconds, then again for the same duration and then disappeared. It was an overcast evening, the ground was covered with snow and it was in a very well lit park at the edge of Carlton University campus. The park was deserted but there were cars driving directly under the object. The conclusion that my friend and I made was that it was undeniably extraterrestrial and could not possibly be an experimental craft or any other form of illusion ie: balloon.  When the object jumped from one location to another it was an approximate leap of 500 feet.<n>
12/1/92 01:00|Tromsoe (Norway)||Light|8 sec|Small white bounsing light over steel bridge in calm weather.|6/6/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12924.html|15|ndxe199212| Small white bounsing light over steel bridge in calm weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It saw this while travelling home in a taxi over a large bridge in the city, the weather was calm, the sky was clear (nighttime), the temprature was probably around -10 to -5 centigrades. While I was in this taxi travelling westwards over the bridge(which is a large steel-structure), I saw a small white light, circular in shape heading in about 20-30 kilometers per hour in a 45 degree angle(towards north) towards the top of the bridge, I observed it moving in this fashion for about 2 seconds. I was shocked at once, thinking it could be nothing else than a helicopter crashing into the bridge. Before I had time to notify the taxi-driver, the &#34;white light-ball&#34; started behaving strange; when about 5 meters above the bridge it suddenly bounced straight up about 5 meters and stood there quite still for about 1 second, it was now about 10 meter above the bridge. The speed it bounced must have been huge, because I could not see it move from a(5 meters above the bridge) to b(10 meters above the bridge), it was like it just &#34;re-positioned&#34;. Then it re-positioned in a straight line about 5 meters to the north, in the same re-positioning fashion as before, it stood there about 1/2 a second. Then it re-positioned itself 5 meters straight down, and stood there fpr about 1/2 a second, it was now almost directly above the bridge. Then it re-postioned about 8 meters to the north, then another re-position about 10-15 meters to the north, and then again about 20-25 meters to the north. These last three re-positioning happend quite fast, the light re-positioning faster for each step. Then it was gone. I recond the light could not have been much larger then about 1/2 a meter in diameter, and no smaller then 1/4 of a meter, all in white light, like a large 200 Watts light-bulb. It never changed shape, intensity or color. The taxi-driver claimed not to have seen anything.<n>
