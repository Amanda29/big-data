A bright light looking like a star moved very quickly from southern horizon approaching us and suddenly stopped directly over our heads -- this took about 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It immediately turned 90 degrees and quickly sped away to west at same speed for about 5 seconds. It then came to a sudden stop and hovered clearly visible to us over- head. I checked every hour from 8 PM to midnight but it remained stationary. It remained looking like a star but impossible to determine altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me as a medical doctor psychiatrist, it is impossible for light to stop and make a 90 degree turn at high speed. We saw no actual craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/16/62 12:00|Haverhill|MA|Disk|5 minutes|Two Silver Disks observed in broad daylight.|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79831.html|2|ndxe196208| Two Silver Disks observed in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following event took place nearly 49 years ago.  I was nine years old at the time of the event.  It happened in mid Summer, and in broad daylight.  There were two witnesses to the sighting, myself, and a friend that I will refer to as Willy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I lived very near one of the largest hills in Haverhill, Mass.  We called the hill, Tilton&#39;s Tower, because at one time there had stood a large, brick viewing tower atop the hill.  The tower was long gone by 1962, and in its place was a large (200 ft. +/-) radio transmission tower, which was used to broadcast our local AM radio station.  If it was used for anything else, I know not.  The entire hill was otherwise devoid of any houses or buildings.  It was a great place for us neighborhood kids to play and explore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a bright sunny August day, my friend Willy and me decided to hike up to the top of the hill.  We had made our own bows and arrows, by bending a branch for a bow, and using the straightest sticks we could find, as arrows.  &#34;Come on, let&#39;s go to the top of Tilton&#39;s Tower,&#34; I said, &#34;Maybe we can shoot a rabbit.&#34; Willy and I climbed to the top where the grass was nearly waist high.  We walked through the tall grass hoping to flush out a rabbit, but alas, the only thing jumping were grasshoppers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So that we might make some use of our bows and arrows, I got the idea that we could shoot our arrows straight up into the sky, and see whose arrow would go the farthest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Okay!&#34;, said Willy, &#34;I&#39;ll bet mine&#39;ll go higher than yours!&#34;  We both drew back on our bows and pointing our arrows straight up. &#34;Reday&#34;, I said, &#34;Aim... Fire!&#34;  &#34;They went about the same height&#34;, Willy said. &#34;Okay, let&#39;s try it again&#34;, I said.  So, again we pulled back as hard as we could on our bow strings, pointed our arrows up toward the sky and.... &#34;Hey!&#34; I yelled, &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34; I lowered my bow, but kept my gaze straight up, for there in bright blue sky, was a silvery, shiny disk darting this way and that. &#34;Hey! Do you see that?&#34; &#34;Yes&#34;, Willie replied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disk was bright silver, perfectly round, and moving in a zig zag pattern, that gave me the impression of the movement of a gyroscope.  It tipped slightly, banked, moved forward and side to side. The sun was nearly directly overhead, and it almost seemed to playing tag with the sun.  We stood and watched it for a minute or two.  The size was about what a dime would be at arms length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;What is it?&#34;, I said. &#34;I don&#39;t know... a Flying Saucer.&#34;, said Willie.  Suddenly, the first one was joined by a second. &#34;Hey look!   Now there&#39;s two of them!!&#34; I shouted.  The two disks moved close to one another at the same altitude.  While their movements were quite erratic, and while they crossed paths with each other, they didn&#39;t collide.  They both remained pretty much overhead during the entire sighting period.  Then... in an instant... they were gone!   &#34;There gone!&#34; said Willy. &#34;Yeah, where did they go?&#34;, I asked.  We scanned the sky, but the two disks were no where to be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, we hurriedly made our way down the hill.  I&#39;ve never forgotten that day. There is no doubt in my mind that the two disks that we both saw were real.  Beyond a doubt, these were solid, controlled, flying objects, and could not have been anything else.  I consider myself very fortunate to have had this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was about 14 or 15 years old had been on a date with a young man I met at a church retreat. It was my first car date.  I was hugging the door knob I was so shy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the way back near Ann Arbor we saw a disc shaped object at about tree line maybe 100 yards away.  It was probably 40 - 50 feet across.  It was shiny light grey and had lights around it. Maybe even windows.   We sat in the car and wondered what the heck it was.  We were listening to the news on the radio, probably an Ann Arbor station... and they said a UFO had been sighted in the Ann Arbor area.  We peeled out of there so fast.  Because it was before I was driving, I wasn&#39;t paying attention to roads and have no idea exactly where we were.  I remember scooting to the middle of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The odd thing is that it took me years to remember it again. I thought people would make fun of me.  I can&#39;t even remember telling my Mom about it when I came home.  Now I think about it a lot.  I hear about people sighting &#34;lights in the sky&#34; and calling it a UFO sighting and think mine was huge compared to that.  There were lots of UFO sightings in the Ann Arbor area and they were always &#34;swamp gas&#34;.  This was no swamp gas.  But I can&#39;t find a record of a sighting in the 1961, 1962 or 1963 timeframe in this area.  Lots in 1965.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My father got out of the car and looked to see if anything happened to the car.  While that, my mother was still telling him to get in the car so they can leave. He got back in the car  and we left.

The shape appeared in  silhouette against the sun.  The four lane highway was divided by a median down which stretched the highline towers.  Below the object, at least 20 vehicles were pulled off the road into the median and people were out of the vehicles looking up at the object.  When we arrived at the scene, my stepdad pulled off the road into the median and we all got out to look up at the object.  From below, it appeared to be a large circular craft with a diameter of approxamatly 50 or sixty feet across.  There appeared to be a section somewhat inside the outer rim that was turning counter clockwise, but it was very difficult to see this movement.  While we watched, the craft made no sound that we could hear.  After we had observed the craft for apporximately 20 minutes without any noticible change in it, we began to hear the sound of approaching helicopters approaching from the West from the diirection of Lowery Airforce Base.  As the three copters approached to about a mile distant, the craft above us began to silently move away toward the East.  It seemed in no hurry to leave, and kept the distance between itself and the three copters approxamately the one mile distance.  We watched until the object and then the three copters had disappeared over the hill we had decended from, and then got back into our car and resumed our trip home.  After we dropped off the three soldiers at their barracks on the base, we rove home, and my Stepdad, called Lowery Air Base to report the object.  He was told they knew about it and requested he keep silent about the sighting.  This is the first report I&#39;ve made of the sighting to anyone.  My stepdad is now dead and I can&#39;t remember the names of the three soldiers, so I give this rep! ort on t he off chance that one of the other people who obviously saw the same object we did, will have already come forward with a report or will come forward if the read this, to substantiate the truth of this UFO sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

They were nebulous and indistinct.  I know I was afriad.  I had been playing in an old rail yard behind our block (lots of sand hills). I was headed home alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon after this I discovered a small healed scar on the back of my thigh - yet I had not been hurt there (it was about 1-1.2 inches long). It showed some &#34;weaving&#34; type of skin growth between the two smooth edges and tiny pin points around the edges. It remained faintly white for many years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was nearly 50 years ago and the memory has remained clear and insistant - like a tooth ache that has refused to go away.  I am sharing this now - in the hope that it may help someone else who may have also encountered &#34;something&#34; strange during that time in this location (between 1958-1968).  I had two, possibly three other things occur that I have also never spoken about (by the lake and in town - reported earlier).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

We walked up to the beach road where we could see the shore and the ocean.  An object was in the sky.  It wasn&#39;t an airplane because it moved too slowly.  It wasn&#39;t a helicopter because it moved too smoothly and made no noise.  It had yellow and white lights. We could not make out the shape but by the position of the lights, I&#39;d say it was curved.  It came in our direction, hovered, then took off at an acute angle without the body of the ship changing direction.  It sped off quickly and disappeared over the ocean.

8/1/62 17:00|Hudgson (Canada)|MB|Oval|60 seconds|My mother and I have seen a U.F.O. at very close range. We can identify this object as a flying object unknown to mankind.|12/2/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11371.html|10|ndxe196208| My mother and I have seen a U.F.O. at very close range. We can identify this object as a flying object unknown to mankind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was seven years of age playing on our front lawn, my mother was out in the side yard hanging up the laundry on a close line. The event that was about to take place at that time is forever etched in my mind. Back in 1962, my mom, dad, little brother and I, lived in northern Manitoba, Canada on a large hobby farm. Our nearest neibour was 1/4 of a mile away. To my knowledge, nobody else in the area seen what my mom and I saw on that warm August afternoon. A slow moving object caught my attention from the corner of my eye. I looked up over the garage located across our front yard and saw a large football shaped flying craft. It was approximately 100 feet away from me, flying approximately 30 feet above the ground. The craft was approximately 20 feet wide and 10 feet high. There was no sound of a motor. This craft seemed to be very high-tech as it had no wings or engine to be seen. The occupants of the craft must have known there was life forms on the ground, namely our family. I believe they said &#34;Hello!&#34; with a spectacular display of lights which illuminated there craft in top to bottom (3 foot) strips of blue, green, red, yellow, and other fasinating colors. The craft changed direction as it flew over the garage from north to east. At this point my mother looked up from her cloth line and saw the slow moving craft (traveling at approximately 10 miles per hour) heading in a eastern direction. I seen this object with my own eyes...we are not alone in the universe. Perhaps there are many types of life forms from far away places roaming the sky above and walking among us. Another unexplained encounter happened during the summer of 1975 in the province of British Columbia, Canada. I was walking in a rugged open area 200 feet from the Fraser River when an unusual object caught my attention. There on the ground was a foot long cylinder and about 10 inches around with rounded ends. As I looked down at this object I noticed it&#39;s mirror-like appearance. As I looked closer I noticed there wasn&#39;t a scratch on the metal-like object. I reached down and picked up the object, it seemed to weight about 5 lbs. From that moment on until I found myself walking away from the area...I have no memory of what happened. I still search my mind today and ask myself what happened to the strange cylinder? I would have never put it back on the ground. I know I would have take! n it wit h me to find out what it was. Today, I believe that what I saw and held in my hands was a landed probe from outer space. Perhaps the same type of probes seen flying over crop circles throughout the world. Whatever I held in my hand could have had a hand in the loss of my memory. I believe it did.<n>

We ran toward it, and as it seemed to hover, quite low, we could look right up inside of it-- it was a large, round or oval(disk shaped) craft with a row of lights around the perimeter of the underside of it.  The lights seemed to move around the perimeter of the craft.  We could see what seemed to be a bright hazy light coming from what appeared to be the bottom of, or inside of the aircraft.  After hovering, it moved away, but continued at a very low elevation for quite a while-- all of the kids on our street who were outside ran after it for as long as we could before losing sight of it.  As long as we were fairly close to it, we could hear a rather strange whirring or whooshing noise.  As my mother had gotten a glimpse of it from inside the house and the porch, she called and made a report to the police department.  The next day there was a small article in the Savannah newspaper  stating that there were numerous reports of the sightings, but the air force had determined that it was actually a weather balloon.  However, I don&#39;t think it was, judging from my memory of the object.  There was nothing about it to suggest a balloon of any kind.  I have long been curious about any other reports of this sighting, but have been unable to find any, and the Savannah Morning News cannot even find the small article about the sightings in their archives (I&#39;m not positive about the date, or even the year, but am fairly certain it would have been the early 1960&#39;s).  I am a college graduate, professional woman, married to a law enforcement professional.  I&#39;ve never observed any other UFO type objects at any time before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
