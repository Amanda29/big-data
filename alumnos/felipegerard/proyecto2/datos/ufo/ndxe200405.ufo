Our driveway faces almost due west.  I noticed a very bright object toward south of the driveway which was moving horizonally at an elevation of approximately 40 degrees above the horizon.  I pointed this out to my wife and she commented that it must be an airplane.  We watched for several minutes and I pointed out that there were no other lights ( red or green) as normally seen with aircraft.  She said the object looked like a sphere with a halo adound it.  She went into the house to get the binoculars and I continued to watch the object which continued traveling toward the west at a slow rate of speed.  The moon was very bright and was at an elevation above the object and east of the object approximately 30 to 40 degrees.  Only a few stars were visible to the south an these were much higher in the sky.  At this point something very strange happened. A bright object ( not nearly as bright as the original sphere ) eminated from the sphere and traveled at a very rapid rate to the east at an angle of 120 degrees from the path of the bright sphere.  This object ( much smaller than the original sphere) had a faint red glow to it.  It continued moving at high rate of speed in a straight line until it was no longer visible at an elevation of approximately 75 degrees above the horizon almost due south.  I returned my attention to the original object which was no longer moving to the west but appeared to be moving away from me as the size continued to get smaller. It also appeared to be slowly gaining altitude above the original elevation when moving to the west.  I continued to watch the original sphere for another 10 to 15 minutes. At this time the original object was much smaller and not nearly as bright as when first observed.  I stopped looking at the object at about 11:20 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Looking up to check the weather/cloud coverage I noticed an odd shape just floating through the sky. I kept staring at it because it was round and pink/orange colored and it just seemed so out of place. I asked my boyfriend if he saw it too but he was standing about 5 feet higher than I was (on the back of a moving truck) so before he could follow my pointing finger it dissapeared in the clouds.It didn&#39;t blink/flash and was not anything I have ever seen in the night sky before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before it vaished in the clouds it seemed to leave a little trail of sparks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked very much like the image on the home page, but I wouldn&#39;t discribe it as a fireball, because it kept changing colors.(pink/orange) Did anyone else see this thing???<n>

I got closer as I drove and noticed it wasn&#39;t moving, or it was moving towards me and I couldn&#39;t tell.  I got next to it, or at an angle where I could see it, and it was triangle in shape, black, with bright white lights at the vertices of the triangle.  It had a glowing red light at the center of it and it was just hovering over a subdivision of houses.  I kept driving, though I really should have stopped, and as I drove by it I saw it hover over the highway away from the group of houses.  That&#39;s all I saw of it before I was too far away to see detail, only light.  It looked like it was moving towards Metro North Mall.  I&#39;m not sure what county that is in, that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t provide it in this report.  I am guessing that is part of Kansas City, Missouri, but it could be in a different city close by.  I was on my way to Liberty, Missouri when I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The latter just happens to be the home of STRAT COM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So if viewed from affar, it could look like one of the F-16 were chasing an airliner, and when its After-burners were turned off, the blue tint would seem to vanish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Granted this is not a true report of a sighting, but I saw no other way to contact you to let you know of this.  It would be nice if you had a way to report what might be an explination to some of your reports.  I am not debunking what the people said they saw, just offering one explination for the events they saw thank you for your time<n>

As it traveled across our field of vision while we were facing east, it turned into two lights.  A plane headed north flew just a few feet from the object.  The object neither turned nor tried to avoid the plane, but the plane looked like it tried to avoid the object.  Then a third light appeared.  Triangular formation of lights travelled slowly and steadily south.  This object was caught on video tape using a Sony camcorder.  The lights looked to be white, but when the tape was reviewed, we saw that the two outside lights were red and the one in the middle was green.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were watching some air traffic that fly over the house checking out the moon and the planets. After the last plane went near the horizon, I ask my wife to look at the planets because one of them started to move SE and gained speed greater than that of the planes we were watching. After about 3 seconds of speed the object then veired upwards and began a high rate of climb. I told my wife that I have never seen anything climb that fast. The object went straight up and the yellow light got smaller and then faded out of sight. The object did look like a yellowish planet in the SW night sky. If it did not move I would have never noticed. I believe the object was far higher than the planes were flying. From where the object was sitting, it had a clear view of the coal electric generating plant in Joseph City.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Immediately I knew that the object didn&#39;t belong in that quadrant of the night sky. I brought it to the attention of 2 nearby friends. At the moment that the individuals gazed in the direction of Canis Major, the object (void of contrail or trailing &#34;burn off&#34; debris) bolted to the east for about 1-1.5 seconds coming to a full stop within the Sextans Star Formation.It held almost perfectly still for 10 seconds, then In a &#34;wobbly&#34; manner appeared to decend, as well as dramatically decrease its intensity and magnitude to a faint pinhead object. At this point it was almost behind the house tops. This was a magnificant white light that appeared to (along it&#39;s decent) jettisen one other &#34;Gold&#34; colored object wich remained stationary for about 4 minutes then We lost siter of it. The Main Object was so intensly bright that disearning a shape wasn&#39;t possible. If I had to hypothesis I would say it was probably sherical or round.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were two Caucasian Filipinas at the Consulate who said something about the Embassy of France, and one of them said, “Thank you” to the people at the customer service window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later, I was walking on Velasco Drive, also a block away from my street, when I saw a round black object appear in the western sky.    It was surrounded by a rainbow-colored halo, and it moved slowly through the grey sky until it set behind the Santa Teresa foothills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the Filipinas again in a dream I had in February 2009.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have tried to get out of the assault situation by reporting a dream about my boyfriend Quetzalcoatl from Rolling Thunder, the Cherokee shaman, on May 14, 2009, after which I woke up crying and made some hot chocolate, along with other information, to the Records Office of UC San Francisco Medical Center where my mother drove me on the day I was assaulted .<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the first week of June, there were thunderstorms that I did not want throughout the state of California.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It happened so fast that it was the topic of discussion for the rest of the day.  All of us that seen it described the exact same thing.

Faded away over 5 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> I spotted the object (oval in shape) while driving east on Angeles Crest Hwy.  My position was about one mile east of Vincent Gap, at a turn off.  The object was to the south south west, in the direction of Azusa, Duarte, of which there is a clear view through the San Gabriel River Valley.  The object was burning bright, orange, white with a dark edge along the bottom.  Very nearly stationary.  About 1/8&#34; at arm&#39;s length.  It faded away over 5 minutes, growing somewhat smaller, but not appreciably.  Most of the observation was through 8X binoculars.  I had the feeling it was initially 2 - 3 miles away.  The angle of elevation was a couple of degrees below the horizon and did not change during the sighting.  My position was approximately at 7300 feet.  I could see surface features in the background, probably 30 miles away.  (If it was not stationary, it would have had to have been traveling nearly directly away from me.)   It moved very slightly toward the west during the viewing.  It did not change shape.  The initial &#34;Fire&#34; faded to a neutral color within a couple of minutes, then eventually faded into the smoggy background.  It left no traces of smoke or other atmospheric effects.  Sky was very clear, bright sun, little wind.  Positions noted on Topo map, available on request.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For reasons I will not go into now, I&#39;ve ruled out the possibility of it being any conventional aircraft, a balloon, or an object on the ground.  Other observers might have been at Vincent Gap, hiking along the San Gabriel River, at the San Gabriel Reservoir, or in Azusa/Duarte area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I felt I was coming out of a dream, but realized it was REAL.  By the time I got out of bed to look out of my window, the lights and humming were gone.  Have never experienced anything like this in my life, and have faith in God so am not afraid.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were bright lights on it, at first it was a little spot but soon it got bigger and looked like a diamond shape. First it was red, then brown, then blue. I closed my eyes and looked again, it wasn&#39;t there, but another thing was..... It was a kind of super-man shape, well, it wasn&#39;t a man, but it looked like some kind of soft toy. It had a red and blue cloak on. I closed my eyes opened them again and nothing was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Probably still a few thousand feet up but no where near other stars and was bigger than a star.  The body would appear in the night sky for a few minutes and then would disappear for a few minutes, I would say 5 at the most.  Then the body would appear again usually much above where it was before, probably at least a few thousand feet where we first saw it.  It then would float around the sky heading left and right and then would disappear again.  It then reappeared again but this time close to the tree line and of course much lower.  I don&#39;t think the government has any space craft or war planes of this size or what it was doing and there have been many other reports of this in the west part of Phoenix area and suppounding areas.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She told me to come and look at it and my first impression was that it was indeed a planet that was flickering in the haze.  Then I realized that it was a clear night with no haze and the flickering was more like a constant flashing.  The flashing light was changing colors from blue to orange or red.  Also, it was low in the north-northwest horizon and slowly moving lower, closer to the horizon.  It was moving very slowly, much more slowly than any aircraft that I know of.  You had to be watching it closely to discern the movement.  It seemed to be hovering as it lowered in a diagonal direction slightly toward the north.  The object made no sound, although it was probably too far away to be audible, anyway.  During the sighting, I took several 35mm pictures on a fresh roll of film, but it will be a while before they can be developed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I write this report, the object is still visible over an hour after it was first seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37282.html|18|ndxe200405| As I was driving in a northerly direction on Hwy. 101 from my home in Santa Maria, CA (about 8:30 pm on Sunday, May 30, 2004), and just before I reached Nipomo, CA, I spotted what appeared to be a red fireball with an extended tail, high in the sky.  It continued going in the same direction as I was, becoming smaller and smaller until it became a small white light just before it disappeared, which was about the same time that I reached the city of Arroyo Grande.  The sky was quite clear, so it was easy to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had at first theorized that it could be a plane on fire, but it never came down. Then I thought perhaps it was a meteor or &#34;shooting star&#34; - but it was still daylight, there were no stars yet visable, and it never &#34;disappeared&#34; as shooting stars do.  Then I thought of a missile from Vandenburgh A.F.B., but realized that they are usually shot off in a westerly direction (in case they fail, they will dump in the ocean and not hit cities, homes, etc.).  I still wonder if it was a missile shot off at an earlier date, that just happened to be low enough for me to see now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have asked our airport tower - they have no answer.  I asked our college - noone knows there either.  I called my local TV station.  I don&#39;t know who else to ask.  Can someone explain this to me?  I would love to know what it was!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  we spoke with this witness via telephone, and found her to be exceptionally objective and credible.  When we asked whether the sighting might have been caused by a high-altitude contrail, brightly illuminated by the setting sun, she allowed as how she thought that might be a possibility, and that others had proposed the same.  Just a guess.  PD))<n>

About 8:00PM at night he was looking out his window. He noticed a bright neon blue light about two to three times the size of the largest and brightness star in the sky. From about the top of the horizan the object streaked down. It appeared to be some distance away. He said that the object was moving faster than any planes he had ever seen in the sky, but didn&#39;t move so fast to leave a tail or tracer. He is unsure if the object blinked on and off or if it appeared that way because he was seeing it from behind some tree limbs. After a few seconds the object disappeared behind a mountain across from us. I would have been skeptical to file a report for him except I feel he is familiar with the night sky, stars and the appearance of aircraft in the area. We enjoy the sky and stars and watch them on a regular basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We couldn&#39;t see the aircraft, but we could see a very bright reflection, from the setting sun. The reflection was too bright to be any kind of small airplane, as they appeared to be up pretty high. I ran inside the house to get me bonoculars, and when I came back out they were gone. I was only in the house for at most 20 seconds. They were traveling at a farily fast speed if they were up that high, but this is only a guess, as I don&#39;t know the altitude OR size of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also: My sister saw the objects, and there were no clouds in the sky. I would like to know if RADAR contact was made. I did not hear any sound from the objects, I could hear plane engines later, but from a different direction. Please email me if you can find out if RADAR contact was made, likely at T.F. Green airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

A clear bubble about the size of a quarter came floating up the path, and twice bumped into rocks without breaking.  Then it landed in the grass, and again without popping.  Two of us moved swiftly towards it to examine it, and it took off at high speed, negotiating between to fence boards, and disappeared.  One of us is a social worker, one a family therapist, one a retired electrician.  None of us drink or use drugs.  We thought there must be a natural explanation for this, but have been unable to find anything that resembles what we saw.  It was suggested we contact you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were northeast of Wickenburg,Az about ten or twelve miles or so. I was the last one up sitting there in the chair enjoying the cool Arizona nights. When I noticed what appeared to be a star heading west to east at a very high rate of speed. at first I thought it was just a satalite (we see alot of them in Az) but I dont think I could of seen this one so close to the earth horizon. I thought it might be a Jet liner but there were no noise and no flashing lights. I watched it go across the horizon in about 3 minutes and then it vanished from view. I have reported two other sittings  on here about lights we have saw in the last 5 months. It is amazing what you can see if you just look. I would still like to know whats going on out there in the western part of Az? I think a lot of people were like me, they see these things but they never get reported. ((name deleted))<n>

To the south side and inside the rainbow were four somewhat triangular shaped objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were very bright and were stationary.  One of the objects traveled slowly down to hover above one of the other objects, but for the most part, they all stayed in one spot.  Three remained in a triangular formation and one of them remained above the rest of the group.  The objects faded away or were obscured by clouds and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several customers and employees of the grocery store witnessed this occurance and there was much discussion as to how strange the sighting was.  Most of the witnesses noticed the very vivid rainbow prior to the appearance of the four objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

No noise was heard.  I am about 3 miles from the beach and the costal winds were blowing from west to east at this time.  I thought it might have been a balloon since lego land is down the road, but it altered it&#39;s course and began heading south.  The bottom of this object seemed to be jet black in color, while the top looked as if it were mirrored because the sun reflected off of it with tremendous brilliance.  The object would wobble back and forth every 6 seconds or so. that&#39;s how I noticed the mirrored top.  I watched it until it moved out of view, still heading south along the coast.  Numerous aircraft clutter the airspace because palomar airport is down the street.  compared to landing aircraft, I would say the object was roughly the size of a volks wagon beetle and flying at 800ft or lower.  I have an extensive knowlege of known military applications and have experianced several UFO sighting both alone and with multiple witnesses.  It may have been a ballon, but a balloon is not going to turn south while the wind continues to blow east.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was playing around with a new digital camera I bought a few months ago.  After taking some pictures of our campfire I decided to try and take a picture a star that stood out almost directly above our campsite.  I stepped away from the fire where it was fairly dark and took two pictures about 30 seconds apart.  I did not see any other light or star near the one that I was taking the picture of.  We went to bed at close to 1:30am.  I first noticed the light object when I downloaded the picture to my computer on Tuesday the 1st of June. The 1st picture shows a faint light located below the star,  the second picture shows the light located a lot closer to the star than the previous picture.  It had to be moving fast to change position as much as it did in that time span.   I have been busy and just now got the chance to write this info.  I have no idea what the object is or where it came from.  I will try to send the image with this info.  If I can&#39;t I have it available on the computer and it is still on my memory card in the camera.  Anyone interested in seeing it please let me know.  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Two photos accompany report.  The second light may be another celestial body, but that is a guess.  We have no reason to necessarily believe the the object is a genuine UFO.  PD))<n>

On 5/28/04 at 2244 hours, I was leaving my residence for the 11x7 shift.  As I approached my vehicle I looked up at the sky to see what kind of a night (weatherwise) I was in for.   Clouds were &#34;broken&#34; at 2400 and the temp. was 59 degrees.  As I looked up at the moon in the west, I noticed there was a planet (which one?) at the moons 5 o&#39;clock, and two stars all more or less in a direct line.  Then I noticed the middle &#34;star&#34; was moving north at a fairly high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw it, it was just slightly dimmer than the planet and brighter than the closest star.  As the unknown continued north, it grew dimmer and dimmer at a steady rate until it just went out all together.  There were no navigation lights visable after the white light went out, there was no sound either.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Both of us were taken back by what we saw out the front window.  We have waited a week, called the Arizona Daily Star, and no one has contacted us.  It was a &#39;fireball&#39; that was in site no more that 1-2 seconds. What was unusual was the size...possible 2-5 times larger that what we thought would have been a plane, and 100 times larger than the thousands of metors we have seen in our life.  It was dark, and hard to judge distance, but I would think it covered 10-20 miles in those 1-2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was wearing prescription polarized sunglasses and after looking for a few seconds made out a smaller much more dim silver spot next to the bright light. Then the small silver one disappeared and the bright light began moving north or to the left of the moon. it moved appx. 3 feet at arms lenght at steady slow speed then stopped, stayed ffor about 10 minutes and disappeared.. There was air traffic at high altitude I would guess 35,000 feet east to west not near the objects but allowed me to guess these were near the top of the atmosphere, well above any air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The outer parts were dark with the inner part being lighter.  This object was motionless.  It then came into focus as it rotated and became a long shiny dark cylindrical shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran outside to get a better look.  It took me less than 5 seconds to get outside, but by that time it had vanished.  The worker across the street said it had come rapidly from the east to the point were it became motionless.  It was not a balloon, a helicopter or a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I still cannot quit thinking about what it might have been.<n>

I was stopped at the stop light just before the bridge at Mountain View and Boniface Parkway. There were other cars at the light also. I noticed a small aircraft flying from east to west. What caught my eye was it looked to be towing something. This is not unheard of for the Anchorage area, but not all that common either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it was towing a large balloon at first. By comparing it to the plane, I’d say it looked to be about  eight feet tall. As I was looking at it, it stopped moving and the plane kept going. At first I thought it broke away from the tow rope or whatever, but as the plane flew further away, I could tell the sphere was actually much further away than I first thought. I think it had just happened to be moving at the same rate as the airplane, making it look like it was being towed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very near the Chugach  mountain range, which is east of Anchorage. I could tell it was spinning on it’s own axis. It was totally featureless. Just a silver orb now hovering in the sky spinning. Then it just disappeared. It is hard to explain, but it looked as though  it disappeared on itself as it turned. It never made a sound, but it was far enough away that I don’t think I could have heard it if it did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed it, I was looking through my windshield. I thought it might be some kind of reflection off the windshield, so I rolled down my window and stuck my head out, so I’m sure it was actually there. After it had disappeared, I looked around me to see if anybody else in the other cars had seen it. No one seemed to have noticed it. It was only visible for about 15 or 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported this incident shortly after it happened to your web site. It said it had accepted it, but the report never showed on the site. I just chalked it up to a computer error and forgot about it. I’ve only told two people about this incident. My wife and my youngest son. They both laughed at me and thought I was seeing things so I dropped it and never talked about it again. But today, 02/29/08, My oldest adult daughter was visiting with me, and somehow the subject of UFOs came up. Well, it turns out she saw the exact same thing in the same general location about two months ago. So I thought maybe it was important enough to resubmit it. I will leave it to her to decide weather to report her sighting or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This incident really occurred. It was a real object, and it really disappeared before my eyes. I am not an attention seeker. I am a military retiree, an ex cop and currently work in the federal security field, so this kind of publicity I don’t need. Do with this report what you will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

These objects constantly changed positions, were very bright and made absolutely no noise whatshowever, even though they seemed to be moving at a decent speed. Six of them were pretty close to each other, except for one light that was a bit further away. After about 20 seconds they all seemed to gain height, became smaller and eventually disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was very remarkable and has left me stunned. Shortly after seeing the objects (a few hours) I wrote this report. I also checked recent reports on the NUFORC website and discovered similar sightings that took place in Edmonton, Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Around midnight, just inside the West Entrance to the park in an area called, &#34;Hidden Valley Campground&#34;, I saw what I at first thought to be 4 satellites in perfect, diamond configured orbit. It seemed unlikely, but they were extremely high up, silent and moving very slowly.THEY RESEMBLED NOTHING ELSE I&#39;D EVER SEEN. Then, they stopped moving altogether, with two of the &#34;lights&#34; spiraling out and then rejoining the formation. Then all 4 objects sped out in opposite directions, disappearing almost immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately I was alone at the time, and my reporting of the event to my friends resulted in so much laughter I dropped it, and would have let it go forever had my brother not insisted today I scour the web for info (I only just told him about it recently).

At 10:15PM, my neighbor, his wife, and I observed an airplane being followed by a sphere of white light. What caught my eye were two lights in the sky, traveling close together. Upon further inspection, I saw that the lead craft was an airplane, as there were flashing beacons on the wing tips. It was flying towards us. We do live close to the RDU airport. There was a craft behind it, following closely. However, there were no beacon lights on it. It was a completely round, spherical white light. The airplane turned left and the sphere followed it. Now going to our right, approximately 10 seconds since the plane turned, the sphere of white light disappeared. We watched the plane for about 3 minutes until it hit the horizon, where we could not see it anymore. There were no clouds. It was a clear night. The Big Dipper was right above us. We did not see the sphere after that. This was really weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I got halfway down the street, approaching the intersection of Rose and 3rd Avenues, when I noticed what appeared to be a very large swarm of agitated black balloons.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought someone must have released the balloons for a festival, or perhaps the balloons were released by some cruise ship out at sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I struggled to make sense of what I was looking at. The entire cluster seemed to be visibly composed of 8-12 large individual black spheres, all rapidly moving around each other. They were swirling and leapfrogging as though an animated cartoon. The words &#34;nightmarish&#34; and &#34;cartoon-like&#34; come to mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each sphere seemed blacker than black - mere silhouettes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I realized I was observing something incredibly out of the ordinary, I hit the brakes, shifted into reverse, and back tracked into my driveway. I then went into my apartment to grab my camcorder, stepped outside, and started taping.  This entire process took about 4 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In 4 minutes, this cluster, size difficult to determine - appeared to be as large as a car or perhaps house, managed to travel from above the intersection to the clouds you see in the clips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Images and video clip posted at following URL:  http://www.laufo.com/sphere-cluster.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have elected to leave the URL in the report.

We had the radar on to navigate around some weather.  Later in the flight when we were clear of all weather, I got a strong  round 2 to 3 mile return.  But when I looked outside the aircraft there was no weather in that area. The radar beam is only 3 degrees wide and we had it set to cover the level of our flight path to slightly above. If I moved the radar beam up or down 10 degrees or so the return would decrease to zero. When I would tune back to center it was back. But only sky could be seen outside. There was no distortion in the sky. The return was not moving. Our flight path had us pass the return by 5 miles to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If there is something there what kind of camera could capture an image of it?<n>

I was standing, facing away from the house, looking up at a &#34;star&#34; which I believed to be the planet Mars because it had a reddish tint to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was distracted by an object moving diagonally and downwards, coming in over the neighbor&#39;s roof to my left, possibly 1000 or so feet off the ground. At fisrt I thought it was a bat or some sort of bird. It was moving quite quickly and was about to go behind the tree in my backyard when I got a better look at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was almost translucent. It looked as though it had the texture of smoke, or a cloud, yet it retained its shape perfectly, as it flew threw the air. I would define its shape as an arc, a sort of more rounded boomerang. The object then went behind the tree, and was temporarily out of view. I saw it come out the other side, only to change direction, and head in an almost downwardly only direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized then, that what I was looking at was not a bird or bad or smoke or cloud or any terrestrial craft I have ever seen. Then the object simply disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was, and still am, in a heavy state of panic and awe. I was in tears at the overwhelming site of the unknown. (I&#39;m not crazy, it sounds weird, I know, but what would you do if you saw something you thought was from another world.) I will be deeply moved for the rest of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should, however, be noted, that on this same day, I watched a special on TV with my housemate about UFO&#39;s, and have read numerous books about the subject. But, I had remained more of a skeptic on the subject, and have seen dozens of shows and documenteries and yet have never seen anything this remotely unexplainable. I had always figured that if I ever saw something out of the ordinary, it would be something similar to what I have been exposed to in films and television specials, and I would have doubts in my mind about the whole experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am still shaking terribly and there are shivers down my spine. I have no doubts.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(NO OFFENSE)<n> <n><n> <n><n> This posting is NOT to discuss anything which I saw. I am just curious on certain things with regards to UFOs and the Western country. Such points below links to one another, and worth considering. (No offense)  1. Why is the government keeping Area 51 so tightly enclosed and heavily guarded? What is in it that only the government knows but cant let the citizens or anyone else knows about it? That is something that only the western has it. Look at the Asian countries, do they have such thing? Nope!  2. Have anyone ever thought, why almost all UFOs sightings only occured in the western country and not elsewhere? There are so many other countries, vast lands, continents, etc... but why those objects lands only on western lands???  3. If one of your family members are captured at an enclosed area, would you go to that place to get him / her out? Would you try all means and ways to get your loved ones out? Would you fight to the best of your ability to free those who are captured? Imagine...<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. (Not referring to anything or anyone) Would a thief announces his stealings to everyone and wage a war with the authorities and people who goes against the idea of stealing? Or rather, would he use his stealings quietly to his advantage?  5. And if you have ever watched a sci-fi movie, how would the baddies use their stealings to their advantage? Hint: World Leader...<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6. And if... the Earth would really come to an end one day, would anyone emerge as our saviour before then?

I complained that he always sees &#34;everything&#34; and went outside to let him explain where it was.  He described it as a tiny light, which looked like a star moving swiftly from west to east and disappearing from his view.  He pointed where it came from and then we gazed at the sky longer and I saw either the same or another one going from south to north.  It truly looked like a star flying because it was the same size as all the other stars.  But it just kept going in a long straight line until I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  I went inside, having my curiosity satisfied.  He came in later and said he saw it again going from west to east.  It was absolutely not a plane.  It was far too high.  It wasn&#39;t in the usual paths of the planes which fly (very close) to our home and there&#39;s no way the aviation people would have allowed their paths to cross like that, being so close together.  They made no sound and left no trails that we could see.  There were no auxillary lights near them, as airplanes even flying very high, still have that flashing red or green on them in addition to the brighter white light.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.  The span of time from the first one to the last one was about eight minutes but each took about a minute and a half to pass from our vision.  They seemed to come out of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had stopped to watch a developing funnel cloud (somewhere near Omaha) from a safe distance when this object caught my eye to my left. It was round and somewhat cone shaped and appeared to spin. It looked metallic because even though it was overcast, it did produce a glare. The bottom portion of the object looked to be red in color, but I saw no lights of any sorts. At first I thought it might be a meteorological device that scientists use to actually get into the eye of a tornado. They are similar in shape and usually painted red and often are lifted and thrown great distances to later be picked up and studied.  As I realized it was headed my way, I also realized that this was much too big to be such a device.  This thing was at least 20ft in diameter or more and moving in a controlled manner.  At that time I lifted my camera and took two photos before the object stopped for two seconds, hovered, and shot vertically at a very high rate of speed. Then it was gone. I was puzzled and in disbelief at what I had witnessed and immediately began trying to rationalize that this was some sort of debris from a nearby storm, but it simply wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was approaching the crosswalk and stopped because I had to wait for the light to change. I looked up in the clouded gray sky in the distance and noticed what looked like bright white lights. They were motionless at first. At first I thought it was one of those posts of lights simular to those at a ball park or construction site. Then the second thing I thought of was a plane, since this area is not far from Reagan National Airport. The craft, or what I could see of it was motionless. I could not get a closer look because I was stuck at the intersection. It started to move and drifted slowly behind the trees before I could start walking again. I noticed that the planes that are taking off from the airport this morning are no longer lit up since it is now the day time. A plane would not sit motionless like that. Helecopters tend to hover then move, but this was no helecopter, since it had the multiple bright white lights. The area where I saw the craft is also not far from the Pentagon. It could have been something military. I am not sure. I did not see it again. The area where it appeared to be hovering over was Maine Avenue. I was on the corner of 14th street and C street. The object was to the south near the bridge that crosses the Potomac River.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was approximately 1,000 feet in altitude, not too far above the hill on the horizon.  As it moved at a good clip in a westerly direction, I noticed that it was making suttle upward jerking motions. I heard no sound. I would say the size was 1/6th or 1/8 the size of the full moon. No blinking lights on object. It disappeared behind trees and even though I ran down the driveway to the road to get to a better vantage point, I never saw it again.

It didn&#39;t seem to move much. We watched it and after a few minutes, it became 3 lights, which seemed to slowly fade away. As it became harder to see, it still didn&#39;t move much. Minutes later, we thought we could still see something. Probably sunlit, whatever it was just baffled us.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was barely visible and I  thought at first it was a sky search light but it had two distinct leading edges and did not travel in an arc as most search lights do. There was also no clouds for lights to reflect off of and I could see the stars.  The shape traveled South to North rapidly and covered an arc of 90 degrees in about two seconds so that I turned around to  watch it disappear in the opposite direction. There was no sound.   The size was about the size of a small plane if you were to witness a plane take off at the end of a runway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We know this witness well, and she telephone NUFORC just minutes after her sighting.  We suspect she is an excellent witness.  The fact that the object had no lights on it makes it a very unusual event, we believe.  PD))<n>

Zig-zag pattern was around trajectory path from south to north.  If its path were drawn, it would look like a schematic of series electronic resistors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amplitude of zig-zag was about 5/16&#34; (width of my little finger nail) held at arm&#39;s length, and seemed to be in groups of four of five over a distance of 1 1/4&#34; (distance from first joint of little finger to tip) held at arm&#39;s length. The object seemed to do the zig-zag pattern, straighten out for about 1&#34; at arm&#39;s length, then repeat the pattern in the opposite direction.  It would then repeat this pattern.  When object slowed, zig-zag motion ceased.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I saw the object the witness who saw it first saw it stop a couple of times.  I did not see it stop, but I did notice it slow down about three times and resume its original speed as it passed through the ecliptic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot say that the object was self-illuminated, however, it did not behave in a fashion indicating reflected light, or a spinning satellite (these tend to sinusoidally vary in brightness, i.e., &#34;pulse&#34;).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They stayed generally together around the larger orange object for a few minutes and then moved to a radically different position. They were so small it was a strain to keep looking at them. I took four pictures at a 40X zoom and examined them later. That&#39;s when I really thought I had something &#34;unidentified&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed an object (maybe 2000 feet up, just below the cloud ceiling) that appeared to be over Westwood (about a mile to the east).  The object was clearly a disk. I cannot guess it&#39;s size. It was very shiny on one side (it seemed to be metallic). The other side seemed to be black and not reflecting any light. It was not stationary. Its movements were very erratic. Moving very short distances, in all directions. Going in and out of the clouds.  Flipping from side to side. Enabling me to see both sides of the disc. I was able to watch it (as I was driving) for about a minute, maybe two. By the time I arrived at my destination and parked, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So we went outside and set up camp. Then at around 11:37pm, we were listening to Led Zepplin. As we woke up and looked up we noticed some strange lights in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We yelled for my friends parents. His parent came out and we just stood and watched these strange lights in the air. They were sort of a greenish tinted light. The 12 lights were an oval shapped and did not look real big. From our view they looked about 1 centimeter. So if they were up close i would have to guess they were all about the size of a small jet. This unidentified object sat still for approximitly 2 minutes. Then in an instant, they just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noted that I had seen 4 satellites, all traveling north, 2 to the west and 2 to the east. We then observed another light that appeared like a very low, bright satellite traveling from the NW to SE. There was no sound (hot tub was off at the time), no flickering, just a steady, bright white light. The object was traveling beneath a low bank of clouds then it slowed down just before disappearing above the clouds (the same cloud bank it was beneath previously).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is a remote area and at 10:45 pm there is no ambient light. I stepped out on to my porch and looked up at the night sky.  There was a huge cloud bank covering half the sky.  In front of the cloud bank were 5 maybe six very large luminiscent sheets of light.  These translucent forms danced and darted around the night sky and then all of them came together.  After a couple seconds of being together, they would shoot out of the center and dance around the sky again, then back to the center. Each explosion from the center started a new direction for each light. This lasted for about an hour.  It slowly diminished, to 4, then 3, 2,1 and then gone. And so was the large cloud bank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length via telephone, and found her to be quite sincere, and quite lucid and objective in her description of the events she addresses above.

The object had a black non-reflective bottom and a light reflective top. It appeared to be about half the size of the full moon to as it got closer, about three fourths the size of the full moon. It was still very light out so we got a good look at it. It appeared to wobble very slightly. It floated/drifted in a roughly southeasterly direction. We also heard no noise from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First it moved at about the speed of an airplane but when i came back with a camera it was moving very fast. It left a trail similar to an airplane. It reminded me of a short film about comets.

May 22, 2004 at 16:49 from &#34;Anonymous&#34; in Clinton, MO (Henry Co.) and MIG is doing followup investigation for more details plus a digital image of the UFO. Here&#39;s their report&gt; I had gotten to bed around 10:00PM, but woke up at 11:34 last night.. I glanced at my clock to notice the time and at the corner of my eye, I saw a blinking light outside my window. It would say that it was about 3 to 4 miles away. It was in the sky blinking pretty fast.. I decided to get a closer look at it thinking that it was probably some airplane, but when I took a look through my binoculars, it turned out to be some sort of diamond shaped craft.. I can&#39;t be to sure of this, but it had turned around in circles, and its lights where in the middle of this blinking light.. I then noticed that one of the lights got bigger and as it got bigger, the craft kept turning around. Realizing that I was seeing an actual &#34;U.F.O.,&#34; I ran to get my digital camera so that I could take a photo of this.. out of my photos that I had taken, only 1 picture showed the craft.. however, it was orange now, and behind it was what seemed to be another craft!.. But this one was blue.. I am still trying to tell my self that I did not see anything, but just in case I did, I am going to look again tonight.. I will post another message if I see it or anything else like it, again.

It was very dark in colour and silent. Our cat&#39;s reaction to a slight vibration made us notice. Then our garage door started to open and shut on its own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few hours later we managed to fall asleep. But something really strange happened all night. I will tell you what happened to me, then what happened to my husband.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fell asleep in our bed but my husband found me later on the sofa in the living room. The patio door was open. I was half dressed, really weak and disoriented. I felt drained of my energy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband had a really difficult time getting out of bed. He was also disoriented. He found me on the sofa. He doesn&#39;t remember anything except that something prevented him from getting up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a vague recollection of getting up, being guided by something, then nothing except I felt like I was in some strange dream. 3 hours went by between getting out of bed and waking up on the sofa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day after, still tired and taking a shower, I noticed something on my arm. When I was a child I had a triangular mark that had disappeared since then. Now it was back again and it looked like 3 dark stains and my arm was itching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband felt weak the following days. Like me, he felt like he was under observation, spied on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the sensation went away. I don&#39;t know what happened that night but nothing felt normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the same experience when I was 5 and living in Texas. It happened a second time when I was 15.

5/21/04 22:42|Washington, D.C.|DC|Light|five minutes|Lights moving in a counterclockwise oval pattern|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37139.html|101|ndxe200405| Lights moving in a counterclockwise oval pattern<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness One: On Friday evening, May 21, 2004,  I was watching television in bed.  At approximately 10:30 pm, an electrical storm began to develop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was beginning to get sleepy and was considering turning the television off and going to sleep.  When there were two very rare bursts of static on the television about a minute apart (both at 10:42, according to my TiVo clock),  my decision to go to sleep was made since I also feared that it might not be safe to leave the television on any longer.  I pressed the &#34;record&#34; button on my TiVo so that I could finish watching the program at another time, very likely made a quick trip to the bathroom (though I&#39;m not sure), took off my glasses (I&#39;m very near sighted), and got back into bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lay down on my left side facing the large panoramic windows in my bedroom.  Even with my very impaired vision, I immediately became aware of some lights moving in the sky in a way I&#39;d never seen before.  I immediately sat up, retrieved my glasses from the night table, and put them on.  Outside my window and over Rock Creek Park and a large residential building across the street, balls of light were moving rapidly and a bit jerkily in an oval-shaped counterclockwise pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s difficult to say exactly how many there were, but I believe that four individual lights  would be a good estimate.  After watching them for a stunned minute or two, I got out of bed, and went next door to get my sister.  Together we stood at the window and watched this light show for approximately five minutes.  Towards the end, the lights seemed to simply fade away through the heavy cloud cover until there was only one left.  That light eventually faded as well.  I did not look at the clock again until after my sister left.  The time was 10:58.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though I&#39;ve called them &#34;balls&#34; of light, they weren&#39;t perfectly spherical.  There was no hard edge to them, though I do believe there was a brighter intensity at the center of each.  During the entire event, they kept moving in the same circular pattern – very, very rapidly and very, very erratically,  Though pinpointing precisely where they were is tough, I recall that my sister and I both stooped a bit to get a full view of the &#34;show&#34;.  (I usually have the blinds in my bedroom about 1/3 of the way down.)  I forgot until Saturday evening when I turned on my television and my TiVo that I had recorded during the exact time of the event.  Because I&#39;m very sure that it was the second burst of static that caused me to turn off the television, I can time the start of the event (using the TiVo clock) at precisely 10:42.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect, the static on the television is very interesting.  Our cable service is very reliable here and is not affected by the weather at all.  Neither my sister nor I can ever recall seeing bursts of static since we&#39;ve had this service (more than four years) and they are dramatic.  Both are preserved on my TiVo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ll add one other observation.  Living in Washington, DC,  during the months after September 11 we became very used to hearing the jets patrolling our skies.  They were always audible, sometimes even loud enough to awaken you.   Though we no longer (or only rarely) hear those jets anymore, contrails are always visible.  I have watched contrails being formed (almost daily, in fact) and, while you can spot the object making them with the naked eye, it is completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of January 8th of this year,  I was so startled by a pattern of contrails in the sky outside the same bedroom window that I took digital photos of them.  There were at least 20 (and maybe even more) in a very narrow area and I had a hard time imagining how that many planes could fly so closely together without anyone hearing a thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witness Two: On the evening of Friday, 5/21/04 I was in my bedroom reading.  A very powerful thunderstorm had been right over our building for approximately ten minutes when my sister came into my room and asked me to come look at something.  I glanced at the clock and noted that it was 10:46PM.  She asked me to look out the window in her bedroom at the sky over Rock Creek Park.  I saw at different times 1, 2, 3, or 4 blurry, yet distinct white lights moving counterclockwise in an apparent oval shaped orbit.  The cloud cover was heavy, but my perception was that the lights were within or circling one particular cloud.  The lightning was intense and lit up the entire sky several times as we watched the lights. The lights moved constantly in an erratic, jerky fashion, seemingly unaffected by the lightning.  Their movement appeared ghostly to me and I thought of Casper cartoons.  Their shape is harder to describe.  Narrow at the bottom and wider at the top is close – almost torch-like with indistinct edges.  It was my impression that their blurry, undefined appearance was due to the cloud cover and extremely hazy skies.  After about ten minutes the intensity of brightness dimmed and I realized that only one light was still visible as it gradually disappeared.  The storm raged on for another few minutes.  My sister and I talked for a minute or two and I went back to my room at approximately 11:00PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Three bright white lights which changed color before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 5/21/04 and 5/22/04 pencil shaped object was seen hovering in Northeastern sky, north of Palm Coast, Fl.  Large white light in middle, two smaller bright, white lights on either side.  Lights fluctuated between red and blue, and then just red, and then blue.  Object disappeared after about 1 hr.  Probably located between Palm Coast and St. Augustine.  Object appeared to go backward before disappearing out of view.  No sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was V-shaped with plenty of bright lights and was very close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove closer, the object appeared to change shape from a V to an oval shape. It also picked up speed and started travelling in the same direction that we were going (east) and by this time it appeared to be quite far off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wasn&#39;t sure if I was seeing things right - I thought perhaps that these lights were a reflection on the windshield or something but my boyfriend verified what I saw. I was still doubting what I was seeing so I stuck my head out the window because I wanted to see the object with my bare eyes. As we were turning into our driveway, the flying object seemed to stop abruptly and then started to approach out direction (west) and as it was doing so, got much closer to the ground (I&#39;m not sure how low). We got out of the car and stood at the end of the driveway to watch to see where it was going. It hovered and its pattern of lights were changing now from random and extremely fast flashing to 5 bright white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was really hard to tell how far away the object was at this point but we both new that it was a lot closer than before. It did not appear that the lights were attached by any one object; rather, it was as though they were together in a group formation. As it was hovering it was &#34;pacing&#34; north and south very slowly. As we walked closer to the door a red/pink light appeared and it seemed as though it were trying to hide from our sight now. Then as we were walking in the door, it hovered back into our view. I absolutely could not believe what i was seeing. My boyfriend&#39;s witnessing to it was the same as mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It just so happened that as we immediately turned on the TV in our room, a program came on television that was about UFO sightings. It was too odd to be a coincidence. Has anyone else had an experience like my boyfriend and I have had?

I watched them as they made turns and changing places and circling the others, when one departed and flew to the NW and another that i hadnt seen previously seen came in from the SE and joined it and they continued to the NW.  The others continued in formation and disappeared to the SE behind a tree.  They would change color from white to black like turning to the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was sitting still and as I went around a curve I lost sight of it untill I came out of the curve on the other side. The object started to move slowly, then as it was going over my car it picked up speed and disappeared in a matter of seconds.I then turned off Lawrenceburg Rd. onto Brooks and started up the hill, as I came around the curve at the top of the hill a boomerang shaped object was sitting in the sky directly over my car shining two white lights down on me. It had red, blue and white lights all along the boomerang shape, some of them blinking and some not. It was big, I`m not sure how high but it was low enough for me to see that it was huge and what it looked like. I was very scared but it just sat ther and shined it`s lights on me untill I went under it and then I couldn`t see it anymore. I continued on and lost sight of it behind my car but as I turned right on Barth Rd. I saw two of the bright white objects, one on my left and the other coming around behind it. I stopped my car, got out and called my brother on my cell phone and told him what I was seeing. The objects started coming in closer so I got back into my car and drove to my house. They followed me. They then went over me again and went over the trees back toward Lawrenceburg Rd. but I could see them all the time except when they went behind a tree. They started going in a big circle from my house to Lawrenceburg Rd. back around to here continuing to circle slowly, at times speeding up and other times completely stopping, but continuing on in the same pattern for an about an hour, then they started to go in a bigger circle and I would lose sight of them but they allways came back around only getting closer to the house, going in bigger and bigger circles. Then one of them came around and it had a lot more lights and almost looked box shaped , going slowly and a litt! le lower than they had been before,it also had different shaped lights on the side almost like a quarter moon shape and they were white. It made the same circle and went out of sight. When they came back around, they started to get higher in the sky and then one stopped straight up from my house and the other was to the left of my house at about the same height. They just sat there for about 10 minutes and disappeared. It was overcast and cloudy, no stars or moon. It started to clear up a little and I could see some stars about 2:37 AM and then at 2:39 AM they just were gone.It was very quiet while this was happening, no dogs barking, hardly any noise at all.Occasionally I could hear sound from one but it was a muted hum not very loud and other times I heard nothing. At 2:56 I spotted one back over my house very high up, it stayed there for another 10 minutes and was just gone. It is now 3:58 and have not seen one since 3:06 AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These lights were then surrounded by at least 30 smaller white sparkling lights.  The larger, main lights came closer to us, and appeared to be a flying saucer.  One flying saucer flew 100 feet away from our truck for 3 minutes, you could clearly see the outline of the saucer, with dark tinted windows on it.  The saucer then flew backward toward another car, flew next to that one for at least 5 minutes, then flew straight up in the air.  The lights would then appear in the distant sky north, then south, then directly overhead.  They finally dimmed out about one hour after the first appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After aproximately an hour and a half of taping I happened to pass by the camera and look in the frame at some interesting clouds.  I saw an object descend from the center of the camera view.  It had a tail like a jet at first but the tail disappeared after it reached a certain altitude.  Initially the object was moving south west and when it reached the end of its path (behind a house) it was traveling southeast.  It travelled from aproximately 60 degrees from the horizon to about 10 degrees with the horizon when I lost view of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On analyzing the video I see that it makes some eradic motions in the middle of its path.  I have telephone wires in these video frames which show the object is moving and not me.  I have sent a small clip of this video to NUFORC.org.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is important to note that I attempted to see the object with my naked eye at a few points throughout its path and could not see the object, it was purely in the camera that it showed up in nightshot with an infrared filter.  There was no noise present with the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Video clip indicates and indistinct, small light, moving slowly straight down.  We do not know if the movement is the result of camera movement.  Object could be a satellite, possibly the ISS, but we do not have time, just now, to check the ISS schedule.  PD))<n>

Pacific Standard time, I saw in the northeastern sky a series of random light bursts that were clearly not fireworks or an airplane. I could not identify the outline of a UFO, but the movement of the light bursts was bizarre. The light bursts seemed to be jumping in a random pattern, not a straight line, within a small patch of sky. I am certain this was not an airplane or fireworks; if not a UFO, it could have been a satellite.

In this cloud, I saw a rectangular object, white in color, which looked as though it had three windows. Its form was very pronounced.  I told the rest of the family to look towards the sun, at the cloud and asked what they saw.  They said it looked like a building with three or possibly four windows.  We took the Redtop exit to purchase gas and upon entering HI 80 again,did not see the object in the sky. The object did not move for a 3 to 4 minute period, possibly longer since the object was most likely in place before I spotted it and may have been stationery during our gas-up at the station.<n>

I ran back inside and grabbed my digital camera (4 megapixal, 14x zoom) and began taking pictures. The first two craft had already flown past, but I have pictures of at least six others flying in an irregular formation. They mostly flew in straight lines in  somewhat of a formation across the sky, but occasionally some would hover or fly zig-zag patterns as if checking something out. Then they just all continued across the sky. They looked the same, all oval, with a central dark line through their middles, with blinking white lights inside that black line. They moved fast, slow, hovered, zig-zagged, then continued on.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After an exhausting train session, we started to walk home and thats when things began to get odd. With no flash light we followed by the light of the moon dogs began to bark, through out the woods, and through the neighborhood (ahead about 25 min. walk). I pulled out some kiwi and coconut and we began to eat while walking. About to the entrance of the neighborhood we looked up just about the time it happened and an orb shot up toward the moon leaving a light streak when it paused it had a huge flash of light, lighting the whole woods up 3 times as bright as the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After that I saw same kind of flashes at 2 deifferent places which were being focused towards sky at regular intervel and each time it would last upto 5to10 sec this contnewd for about 4&amp;half hours in this period i saw these beams 7 diffrent places i have made rough map and located the postion of objectes and noted down the time they appered.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was moving at a very fast speed. Apoximatly 30ft in the air.  Just above the tree line in our front yard.  I saw the object for about 15 sec.  Then it just disapeared to no where in sight.  Then I Saw a really bright flash.  It got so bright that I couldn&#39;t see strait for a few seconds. It was almost like it blinded me for about 30 seconds.  It was very amazing.  I have never seen anything like this before.  Do you think this was an incodent of a ufo?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At about 10:40 pm, in a small field, I was busy at the telescope when my boyfriend said, &#34;Look at that&#34; as he pointed nearly above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I believed it was a shooting star. but then I noticed that there were 3 star like lights in a tight triangular formation. After a couple of seconds they vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend said when he first saw them, he too thought it was a shooting star but then realized that there were 3 star-like lights traveling in a straight line. He said they suddenly fell into the triangular formation, then spun and one of the side lights took lead of the triangle. A few seconds later they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were nearly directly above, traveling from the south and headed north. They zipped right past Polaris before fading away. They emitted no noise, had no flashing lights, had no tails or left no jet streams. The entire event only lasted about 5 or 6 seconds. Thank you to the witness for the report.

Last night I had my pen and paper ready to record the times of sightings. These UFOs have a pattern of some sort.If they are at a really high altitude they move as gold globes. They appear at a lower altitude as a white moving &#34;star&#34;. Then as they move they brighten and/or dim to gold or orange globes before they seem to vanish. A couple of times I have also seen after the &#34;star&#34; that they become spiky white light and as they move they start to strobe before they become the gold globe and disappear. The sightings last from 3 to 10 seconds and they cover about (approx) five miles, if they are low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky had clouds around the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10:30 globe appeared white just below and north of Leo in west sky, flared 3 times heading north,dimmed to gold  10:35 another one appeared from same place, flashed,strobed,as it flew into the horizon cloud heading north, appeared to be higher altitude from the first one  10:45 gold globe appeared from same place did not flare,headed north  10:55 another flared low in the west sky,dimmed as it headed north  11:00 another gold globe appeared coming from the south flying directly overhead under the big dipper heading north  11:01 white &#34;star&#34; big and bright as Jupiter appeared low in west and flew directly over my building heading east, I guess approx. under 20,000 ft,staying white  11:15 white globe heading south directly overhead. In south became spiky white light and I saw some color flashes,of red and blue, my view became obstructed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11:20 gold globe flying by Jupiter heading north  11:40 gold globe changing to orange appeared flying south above Jupiter These sightings are silent, no apparent contrails or burn off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 11:45 a jet airliner flew west. This brought reality back as it made noise, was identifiable by flashing red and white lights surrounding a vehicle. I compared my sightings with the altitude and speed of this jet. The globes were way above and just below this height if the jet was at 20,000 ft. and they moved a little slower. The heavy clouds had by now covered most of the north western sky,and scattered cloud above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

The light was very low in the horizon maybe 10 degrees up, she came and we both stay for a while looking at the light. Then it started to move down very slow and stay hovering at a lower altitud for much longer. We went to bed and it was still there.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/19/04 21:52|Trail (Canada)|BC|Triangle||HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  There were three lights on each "wing" of the V rotating rapidly in circles.|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37121.html|122|ndxe200405| There were three lights on each &#34;wing&#34; of the V rotating rapidly in circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just found out a number of folks saw other craft while a storm raged in Trail B.C. major case building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Trail B.C. It is Wednesday, May 19th, 2004. I was driving home alone from our local theatre along Highway 3B going south. I was not too far from home and I noticed that a bright light was coming through my passenger window. I looked out the window to the sky and saw the most amazing &#34;craft&#34;. There were no vehicles directly behind me so I drove very slowly. What I saw was a huge craft in the shape of a V hovering very low in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three lights on each &#34;wing&#34; of the V rotating rapidly in circles and creating bright white lights. There were no colours at all in these lights. There was also a very bright light on the &#34;nose&#34; of this craft. This thing was absolutely huge. My heart was racing as I tried to explain to myself a scientific reason why it was there. I could not pull my car over so I decided to get home as quickly as possible as I was almost home. I watched in the rear view mirror but could not see anything. I pulled into my driveway and ran to my deck as quickly as possible. This &#34;thing&#34; should have still been in the sky but was nowhere to be seen. It was incredible. Has anyone else in this area seen anything like this?  Update:  Hi Brian.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a (deleted by HBCC UFO). We had a storm so bad the power went out at approx. 4:45. We had to stay a little late in hopes that the power would come back on. We had an incredible downpour of rain and in the southeast towards the Wash. border a fire started. We had power on the West side of Trail but not on the East (divided by a river) I decided to go see the local movie because there was power on that side of the river. I&#39;m not sure about the moon as it was very overcast. I drove my friend home after the movie and......<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my way home travelling alone East on Highway 3B, my car &#34;lit up&#34;. I looked out the passenger window to the south and saw a &#34;huge craft&#34; in the shape of a V. There were three bright white lights on each &#34;wing&#34; of this craft. There seemed to be rotating extremely fast lights within the lights. (like the chasing lights you would see on a Christmas tree) There did not seem to be a body to this craft like a plane with passengers would have but rather just a V. The &#34;nose&#34; of the craft also had a bright light and the lights were beaming upward but the glow so intense that this is why the light shone in my car. It was not a beam of light but rather a brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This thing was hovering very low and very slowly. I am not good with distance but my husband says the way I described it, he would guess approx 100 metres high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep in mind I was driving. the speed limit was 50 km but I could slow almost to a stop as I had time to look in my rear view mirror and there were no cars behind me. I wanted to pull the car over and take a closer look but this is a main highway and there was a guard rail to my right. I had time to turn my music off - I heard no sound although I did not think to roll my windows down. The size was that of a large plane and it appeared to be grey or silver in colour. I am not sure because the white lights were so intense. There was no colour to any of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember telling myself to pay attention to detail. This is very hard to do when the mind is confused and trying to reason with what the eyes are witnessing. Because I couldn&#39;t stop I decided to go a bit above the speed limit and get home as quickly as possible. This sighting was VERY close to where I live so it was a matter of travelling up the road a bit and turning south (right) into my neighbourhood. I got out of my car ran to our deck and looked in the direction of the sighting but saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We do live by and the sighting was by our Canadian Armoury site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not have any &#34;missing time event&#34; I was so amazed by this sighting though and so confused by it that I had to take a sleeping pill to calm me down to be able to sleep. I had some dreams in regard to what I saw but nothing I would consider out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t think of anything else to tell you. Today I am still rather shaken and trying to apply logic but this thing was so large and hovering so low. I don&#39;t know what is capable of doing this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yes you can speak about it with Wayne on KBS. I am curious to find out if there is anyone else who may have seen this. It was hovering above an area where there are quite a few homes so you would think somebody should have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the way, (deleted) e-mailed me and said he must have just missed it. I think he was also at the movie and I know he would have travelled home in the same direction as I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully I&#39;ve answered all of your questions. I am now a true believer that &#34;something is going on out there.&#34;  I realized I missed answering a couple of your questions. We live near two airports. The main Castlegar airport approx 30 km north. We also have a local airfield approx 8 km southeast. I didn&#39;t see any other planes or aircraft in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Take care Brian.

5/19/04 21:50|Ottawa (Canada)|ON|Triangle||HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  "V" Shaped Object.|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37116.html|123|ndxe200405| &#34;V&#34; Shaped Object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw lots of things since my childhood but yesterday was quite remarkable. I went to get my son in the South East of Ottawa and saw a big light, low above the city, lower than a jet a bit higher than a Cessna. I thought it was a star but when I parked my car, I then realized it was too low and moving in a up and down motion going toward NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it from my car trough small trees with my binocular, I did not get out of the car being in a parking lot, I did not want to get too much attention... After ten to 15 minutes my son arrived. I showed him the light and told him we would follow it. I was drawn by this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say that my son was too. I drove North, trying not to loose it. We got on Industrial blvd direction West , We could see it going lower and further away. We decided that the best lookout was the Rockcliffe (Higher point to look over Hull and Gatineau) one since this thing was going to cross the river. Trying to get there fast, we ended up wasting time trying to find a shortcut to get to the lookout. From the lookout, using binocular 35X 7-21, we watched it for at least ten minutes. It must have been around 10:30 at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;Light&#34; was over the city of Gatineau still moving in a NW direction. It was not perfectly round, it looked like a pinkish/orange crescent from where we were. We stayed there for about another ten minutes and we decided to pursue it . We got onto the Mc Donald Cartier bridge and followed the 50 direction Montréal. We could not see it for a few minutes and then we realized it was gone. After a few minutes of driving on the 50, we saw (Not sure if this is the same light or if these were two different thing?!) a pale orange light low over Ottawa in a South East direction, kind of where we were standing before crossing the river!!! I decided to take blvd de l&#39;aéroport exit and drove south toward Maloney blvd. The light was getting bigger, coming toward us from Ottawa over the river. My son started to freak out, I did not since we were now heading toward the core of Gatineau.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned on Maloney direction West and I could see it coming from the West now, heading toward us. I drove for a minute then got in a parking lot( Small Shopping Centre). The traffic on the road for that time was usual. I jumped out of the car and saw the big light turning bright white, as it got closer. There was a bigger light in the middle of two small lights, one on each side. No green or red lights like regular planes and no flashing light either. To add to the mystery, no noise at all. I don&#39;t know if it was the city noises burying it&#39;s sound but if a regular plane would have been there at the same place, we would have heard something !? We live close to the Ottawa Airport so we are very familiar with usual civil planes... It crossed the blvd going in a South East direction and as it turned it&#39;s side to cross over the street, my son kept yelling this is not a plane!  He was spooked! I was totally fascinated, I had my hair standing up all over my body and I taught it was wonderful, it (I know this will sound weird) seemed to change shape as it was crossing over the blvd, I could not see the shape very definitely but it was kind of weird, a red light appeared and we could see a small white light trailing this massive black shape unfolding in front of our eyes. I vaguely saw that it was very huge and still can&#39;t tell the exact shape of the side. It was so close that it seemed unreal to see this. It was, I think within one Km from us flying toward the ground, like in approach for landing. The only airport close by in this direction was the Museum of aviation on the other side of the river. I can&#39;t tell if it was really over it or not but it seemed really close. Then as it was now going toward the ground, it turned straight for us in a slow wide turn revealing it&#39;s top and then it&#39;s front. At that moment, I yelled too! This was no civil plane, no doubt, we saw a V shape. My legs began to soften as my brain was analyzing and concluding we might not be safe there... The V was flat and wide, and I could see on each branch a row of white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t really say how many, I think it was five or six on each side, they looked like fluorescent tubes side by side, except that these were separated so it looked like tiny rectangles aligned side by side in a black frame. I don&#39;t remember seeing the thickness of the shape, at that moment, I taught this might be what people call a &#34;Black Triangle&#34; Then it slowly continued it&#39;s turn toward west and we lost it because it was too low. I decided to get out of there. For a second, I did not believed, it was unreal and at the same time too real and way too close! As I drove West on Maloney, I think I saw it kind of hovering close to the ground near a wooded area in the back of a big Industry, aligned with Kettle Island and with the Museum of Aviation on the other side of the river. At that point, it was very overwhelming for both of us. I should have called the police, I know, but I was afraid to do so. We drove home in Ottawa South and did not see anything after that but planes. I wish I had a camera, this would have been a heck of a footage!

HUGH object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving home from Yuma at 8 pm. Going east on Hwy eight. I watched a large light for about 40 mins. I have seen it before in 83 or 84 . It was too big to be a star and it was no plane ..It stayed very bright for a long time..I saw it wasent moving and was amazed at how bright it was. Then it looked like it went behind a cloud or smoke comsumed it .. The sky had no clouds in it..I by this time had pulled over to take pictures. Then a bunch of f-16s flew to it .. and almost surrounded it. It started to dim and moved a bit. then it kind glowed  or illuminated from within  for a few minutes. Then it looked like it went behind a cloud or smoke . At that time a cop pulled up to check out why I was parked at night infront of Lewis Prision. When I focused back on the object , I saw it  just shoot away .It just vanished. It was gone completly  . I got some pictures. i think I got a good one of it when it turned the lights off. Also my cell phone signal weekened while I watched it..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  Just a guess.  PD))<n>

My husband was in the shower in the 2nd bathroom. All of a sudden my stepson and I both heard this low rumble and was getting louder by the minute. We heard this noise for about close to a minute before we both went running outside the front door. We looked up and saw this HUGE black triangle shaped thing go over the treetops right directly over head. There were no lights whatsoever but it was really really big. The noise was like a low roar and lasted maybe about 20-30 seconds. I thought it was an aircraft from the army, like one of those stealth bombers. I have never seen one except on tv but there were no lights anywhere on it. After it went over us it was gone, not one sound. Just like it had vanished into thin air. My husband never heard anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was hugh in comparison to the planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked to the horizon over the Caribbean Sea and noticed a strange thing in the sky.  No noise came from the obeject, it was completely silent.  It was not a plane because it was moving much too slow and no planes had flown over the coast during our entire visit.  The craft had white lights that went from front to back in straight line, not blinking, but more forming a line that looked like it went from back to front, moving the whole time, the lights that is, in a circular motion.  Once and a while a red light would mix in.  I went to get my video camera and when I got back the craft had went further down the coast, constantly changing speeds, it then disappeared when it got near the town of Playa del Carmen and where the island of Cozumel is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He lives a few miles up the road.  I was headed back home going SE.  I saw 2 green oval shaped glowing objects &#34;zipping&#34; back and forth.  They were going too fast to see the &#34;zipping&#34; but they would apear in front of and then beside me in the sky.  They were big like the size of a house in the sky.  I don&#39;t know what they were but I&#39;m open to all possibilites (advertising lights, military crafts, airplanes, or UFO).  They did scare me because I know what advertising lights, military crafts, and airplanes look like (we live close to an army base) and I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.  So I called my husband on my cell phone.  The closer I got to home I seemed to be going more towards them and then my cell phone went out.  As soon as I got home we went inside and stayed in for the night.  I don&#39;t know what they did after that because we were too freaked out to investigate and haven&#39;t seen anything since.  My brother&#39;s neighbor saw them from his house that night too but we&#39;ve haven&#39;t heard anything on the news/or in the paper about it.  Of course now I&#39;m the laughing stock of the family!<n>

It did not move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not knowing what it was I ran in the house and yelled to my brother and my husband to come and look but by the time they reached the window facing that direction they could see the smoke that was still there, and no light object, and just to note the smoke seen was not coming from the ground or from any direction if was just around the object. I know what I saw was a light not a plane or anything like that it just sat in the same place. I know it was not there when I first stepped outside because it was just that noticeable. I then called non-emergency police department in Fairmont to see if maybe any one had reported seeing anything in sky she told me no and I replied I don&#39;t want to tell you what I saw because I think you would think I was crazy.

We both noticed a triangular golden colored object moving closer and closer at about the same time. His first words were, &#34; this [flying object] is going to hit us.&#34; As the flying object got closer I noticed it was lined with glowing dots that ran horizontally across the bottom. I yelled out, &#34;stop!&#34; three or four times frantically as a reaction to this bizarre flying craft getting closer and closer. &#34;There it is,&#34; said my passenger as he pointed directly above us. By that time the flying object that first seemed to be on a crash course with my vehicle vanished into the 3am San Antonio sky. This 10-15 second experience was one of the most electrifying moments in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My brother, my friend, and I were all outside having a cigarette... I looked up to the sky and saw all these lights... We continued to look and to our amazement the objects were sometimes close above us and then would disappear. There were several trinagular objects that we got all on camera. These were clearly not airplanes or satellites. There appeared to be a glowing ball of light that was dropped from one of the UFOs. It made it halfway to the ground and disappeared behind the trees. We got some amazing footage of the event. It continued for 2 hours.. Each minute going by, more and more objects began to appear. I strongly suggest you taking a look at my tape...

We observed blueish objects (similar to halogen or led lighting) moving in formation and hovering alone. When together they would bob and weave like insects might. To humor ourselves we shined a led lamp at them only to observe strange reactions. The objects would move eraticly and flash lights back. We saw approximately 8-10 objects this night. The 19th we saw 10-15 objects in pairs and singular. Observing multiple flashes and interactions between objects. We then shined a 1,000,000 candle light at one and it would dim from its bright blue presents and shine down a hallow light shape and light the area like a full moon. After several flashes of our light the object decended when it hit a cloud and we could seen it glow in the clouds mist then out of fear we stopped flashing our light.The activity continued for over 3 hours with constant movement and flashing. Some objects were bright and others were dim but visible. We had binaculars (10x50) and could witness the action with vivid disbelieve. Did anyone else experience this same ocurrence?<n>

I did call him the next evening and took the report which is below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The man told me that he is the type of fellow who watches the night sky as he has a really interest in astronomy and mentioned that he also had found me through the Jeff Rense website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fellow went outside to have a cigarette when he first saw the light/object. At first the man thought it was a satellite. The object was as bright as the planet Venus and heading in a northerly direction traveling from the south on a straight line. As the object moved across the sky another two lights/objects shot out of it, one light heading to the east and the other towards the west. Both of the lights that shot off together went at the exact same time. Also they were not as bright and allot smaller than the main light. The main light never lost it&#39;s brightness as it moved across the sky. The witness believes the object he was observing was at a very high altitude. The object was visible to the fellow for approx: 30 to 40 seconds before it finally disappeared. All of the object were white in color and no tail or trail was seen following behind each of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the person for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

I could not tell exactly how high it was but it appeared to be as high as the jets are maybe 20,000 ft. I had also noticed &#34;satelites&#34; gold in color flying south to north but disappearing at a place in a constellation following Leo and Jupiter in the sky and I could not track them further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Tuesday night I was on my balcony from 11 pm until 3:30 am. I noticed the same satellites. One followed the other by five minutes heading north. Then one went back on the same direction heading south or the opposite direction from where they had been. They seemed to appear from where they disappeared in the sky. They move at the similar speed to a satelite. They are gold in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next event was a globe flying over Vernon the same as the night before from the west. It turned orange and disappeared high over my building. I saw another globe from the same place in the west heading toward the north. My eye was then turned to a bright flaring of super white light high in the sky and this gold globe headed north. My eye caught another flare high in the wnw sky but this one flickered then flared and strobed white light as it headed in a north direction. Another one flared in the nw sky and flew in the direction of the other strobing one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 3 am I noticed two satelites on the same trajectory as first sighted. They were close together seemed to slow down and one proceeded south while the other one headed east. The last sighting was at 3:30 am when a white gold globe flared high directly over head in the sky turned orange and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

Apparently, they were making all sorts of strange rapid and sporadic movements in the sky - most were blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May 17th, we had returned from dinner and were outside swimming in the pool looking at the stars when I noticed a strange light that was very high up, moving side to side.  The airport is closed to air traffic at that time, and there were no other planes or moving lights in the sky, so we watched it carefully. It blinked white and red from what we could make out and it would zig zag slightly from side to side.  There was no pattern to the pulsating and there was no pattern to the movement.  We did notice what we thought was a falling star near to it during the course of watching it. For a long time it was stationary, just hanging in the sky, except for the slight back and forth movements.  After about 30 minutes, it started moving away - Northwest and it grew dimmer as it got farther into the distance going toward Punta Mita.  We could still faintly see it, but then it just vanished - totally gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night, we noticed it was back again around the same time - doing the same sort of things, but we only observed it for about 10 minutes before it started moving away and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparently, there are always sightings in Puerto Vallarta, we were told by locals that those lights have been coming around for years, making strange patterns in the sky.  No one has come up with an explanation for it though.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/17/04 22:00|Doncaster (UK/England)||Oval|2 seconds|17 May 2004 - UFO sighting in the UK. Three large oval shaped lights moving very fast in the sky.|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37034.html|146|ndxe200405| 17 May 2004 - UFO sighting in the UK.  Three large oval shaped lights moving very fast in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe in aliens and &#34;space ships&#34; but I cannot explain what I saw the other night at my home in Doncaster in the UK.  Since I saw the unidentified flying objects I have been scanning the web trying to find pictures of something similar.  As yet, I have not found anything that matches what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sat in my living room playing on my games console when I saw a light in the sky out of the corner of my eye, I hit the pause button on my game and stared through the window at the lights in the sky.  There was a big oval ring of light with two smaller lights near it moving across the sky.  They were not round, but oval and not in perfect triangular formation.  They were very high up in the sky, higher than you would typically see planes and the jet stream from planes and it was very bright.  The lights were a white/light yellow colour - I couldn&#39;t work out whether there was a haze around the lights or whether the lights were that bright that it just looked like a haze.  The main ring of light was very large - I guess maybe 5 to 10 times larger than a medium sized plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all happened very quickly, but as I started to look at the lights they suddenly just sped off in to the distance very very quickly.  I don&#39;t believe there is anything that could travel that fast - there is no jet or missile that could travel that quickly. The whole thing lasted for no more than a couple of seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My logical brain quickly thought it might be a light reflection in the glass of the window pane or a new type of plane, but I could see it in the sky so I know it wasn&#39;t a reflection and this light was so big and so fast that there is no way it could be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before you ask, no I hadn&#39;t been drinking or taking any drugs. I don&#39;t know what I saw and I only wish I had evidence to show you. I have done a drawing (which is not my best subject) to give you an idea as to what it looked like.<n>

But the North Start doesn&#39;t set in the west and I ws travelling west. Suspecting something strange I pulled over to the shoulder and got out my video camera (which I had in the car because I had taken my daughter on a field trip the Friday before).  When I first looked up at it with the camer it was a ball of light that was playing games with me.  when I firt starting filming it was constantly moving and shaking in and out of the camera view.  When I zoomed in on it it would move out of my camera sight...so I would have to go back to normal to have it come back into view.  After about 10 minutes it began to play with me....coming up close to my camera then dancing around and then going back high up into the sky.  Also, when traffic would come down the road it would stop playing with me and sit high up in the sky.  Every once in a while there were spurts of static on my camera outof no where.  I spent about 20 minutes filming (until my battery died - funny thing about it is when I began filming I had 43 minutes of battery life left).  The last thing it did was come extremely close to the camera so I could see it large and in person and then the camera died and it flew back into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/17/04 20:40|Batesville|AR|Light|4 minutes|Orange Pulsating light over Ramsey Mountain, Batesville, Arkansas on May 17th, 2004 at approximately 8:40 pm in the western sky.|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37017.html|148|ndxe200405| Orange Pulsating light over Ramsey Mountain, Batesville, Arkansas on May 17th, 2004 at approximately 8:40 pm in the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought I was simply looking at the top of a radio tower with a light on top. Those lights spin around to alert low-flying planes that there is a tower there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, it quickly came to my attention that this light was not connected to a tower of any kind; it was in fact, floating freely. As we left inner-Batesville, heading up Ramsey Mountain to the South, I lost sight of it. However, as soon as we crested the hill, I re-acquired view of the object, only to learn that it was MUCH higher than I had previously thought. It was still very bright, and it pulsated in a very regular pattern. It reminded me of a heartbeat, it was so rhythmic. It would be interesting to see if anyone else has seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For those interested, the object appeared to be no bigger than a medium orangeish-yellow dot. It reminded me of a radio tower light immediately, but like I said before, that wasn&#39;t anywhere near to the truth. There weren&#39;t any other mysterious craft nearby, but I did notice a couple of airplanes flying in relatively close proximity to the craft (remember now, this is in the sky; references are hard to come by up there), and within half an hour of having lost sight of the object for the last time, I heard two loud airplanes flying overhead. They could have been passenger jets or military craft, I couldn&#39;t say which though. While I was viewing the object, it seemed to stay in one place, moving very little; just pulsating like  crazy. I realized just how high it was when the clouds began to mess up my view of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please, anyone else that has seen this light, please come forward to tell me anything you might know about it. I really don&#39;t know what to make of this, casue I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before. It makes me wanna go out there tomorrow to try and get it to land here, LOL! :D Thanks for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The light, first estimated to be about 2500ft altitude and 3 mile distance, drew my attention because it appeared to have the intensity and quality of a bright aircraft landing light as observed in the night time.  The initial velocity was considerably faster than aircraft often observed flying at that altitude and range.  The object flew at relatively constant velocity and altitude for the first 30 sec. and then came to a gradual stand-still during the next 15 seconds with the light dimming and finally appearing as a white circular diffuse object with relatively sharp edges.  I retrieved my binoculars (7X35 power)within 30 seconds and viewed the object which appeared more like a bell jar shape (1:1 aspect ratio)with an occasional sliver of black at the bottom observed.  The object seemed to move slightly up and down and sideways hovering just below one of the white cumulus clouds (elevation 3205 ft per local meteorological report).  I continued to view the object through binoculars for an additional minute until it disappeared upward into the cloud.  The object never reappeared during an additional 15 minutes of observation.  No sound was heard from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initial AZ and EL angles were later estimated using a protractor jig.  Using these angles plus the flight time and cloud height, a set of latitude and longitude angles were derived using MS Street Finder application.

I looked up and saw two silver disck shaped objects hovering directly over my head.  The sun was behind my apartment and the silver discs were reflecting the sunlight.  I grabbed my video camcorder and recorded one of the disks hovering over me for about 10 minutes.  The other disc had disappeared.  Two hawks flew under and to the right of the object as it hovered.  Then, while I watched throught the camcorder&#39;s viewfinder, the object seemed to fade in and out before it simply disappeared!  One second it was there, faded, came back again, then disappeared the next second.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We are self-employed farmers.  Saw something flashing brighly in W/SW sky about 30 degrees up, sort of like making a &#34;dash dash&#34; patern, and going smoothly in a straight line toward a small cloud.  Only lasted about five seconds, then disappeared behind the cloud.  I looked carefully for it again, but never saw it.  It was extremely bright like neon, and the sun was not that bright that day to reflect on it.  The alternate dash pattern was very regular, too.  Just very odd, so thought I should report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I get a lot a glare from the city lights and they are about the brightest lights in the sky. I&#39;ve been seeing lights appear and disappear over Seymour Mtn. nearly every night so last night right after sunset aimed my camera over there. Just got it set up when I saw a large streak of what looked like fire appear in the sky over Grouse Mtn. It was about twice the height of Grouse and I didn&#39;t see any object at the head of it. Just a bright yellow streak of what looked like fire with drips coming off the bottom of the flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can&#39;t think of proper way to describe it. Sort of like throwing burning gasoline. Appeared just above summit and disappeared above the bottom of the ski run. Time was 21:30 still quite a bit of light in the sky. 21:52 - Camera picked up a white light moving east just over Seymour, I assumed it was a small plane but was unable to see it with either pair of binoculars. I zoomed in with the camera but was unable to see any fuselage behind the light even though it was still fairly light and I should have been able to see something. 22:03 - Camera picked up what appeared to be a similar light approaching  Seymour Mtn. light stopped just above the summit. Unable to see it through binoculars. I zoomed in with the camera and it looked like those other mysterious lights. Object began moving slowly eastward just above mountains in half and hour it was over Indian Arm and at one hour over Heritage Mountain north of Port Moody. I stopped tracking at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 02:00 - Was just scanning the sky with the camera, came across what looked like three stars in perfect triangle all equal in size and brightness. I tried zooming in on each of them and they all appeared to look like luminous slowly pulsing pearls, quite pretty actually. They didn&#39;t appear to be very far away as they filled the screen right away while the starts around them were hardly magnified at all. I don&#39;t know if they were connected to anything as I couldn&#39;t see anything except blackness around them. I could see faint stars all around but nothing showed between them. They were about 80 degrees overhead and just slightly to the NW of my location. Was looking at a star chart and Virgo looks somewhat similar but does not appear to be quite the same shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

I opened my patio doors and watched the light for about two minutes. It never moved. I called my wife to come observe the object. We both watched it for about another two minutes. I ran and got my polaroid 1300 digital and took three pictures. My wife continued to watch the object. I went to my comuter and downloaded the pictures. I have one clear picture, one as it is turning and one displays a series of lights behind it like a long tail. I called my wife in too look at the pictures. We both agree it was something different. I went back out to take more pictures and just as I raised my camera it was gone in a flash. Due to the distance, I did not hear any type of noise. / My back yard was dark, the sky was clear, and it was not an illiusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was moving southeast to northwest (about 330 degrees to true north); and seemed oval in shape with a short, dark yellow tail. The entire object seemed to be on fire, changing light intensities like a flame. In about five seconds it disappeared in the trees on my northern horizon. There was no noise associated with its passage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like it in over four decades on this planet!

We are accustomed to seeing falling stars and other night-time sky activity (i.e. planes, military aircraft, etc.), especially since we have a deck that has 100% unobstructed sky views.   Suddenly, we became aware of a bright, round sphere which appeared to fall very rapidly towards the earth and we thought it was just the hugest, roundest, brightest falling star we had ever seen...perhaps even some type of meteor.  But then, as the light came closer to the horizon it moved sideways - truly one of the oddest sights either of us have ever seen.  Did anyone else see it - or can anyone else out there collaborate this story?  We didn&#39;t BOTH just imagine it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Our property is approximately 2 1/2 miles north of Interstate 10. I was looking South when I noticed a large circular light moving East to West. The size of the object was very close to the size of a full moon and was about 5 to 10 degrees above the Southern horizon. The light moved West for about a second (after I first observed it) and made a very sharp turn to the South and disappeared in a band of clouds. For the next 20 to 30 miuntes I kept watching the Souther sky but made no other observation. I was very impressed by the size of the object as well as the color. It was an almost exact dublicate of a silvery full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought I would take a look through the past reports to see if anyone else reported this.  I guess there was.  8^) Commute milwaukee to chicago every weekday and usually get to see lots of crazy stuff on I94.  Most of it makes for a funny story.  On a particular night last year, I was driving north on 94 about 1/2 way through Kenosha county and noticed a green ball of light traveling pretty fast over what appeard to probably east enough to have been over the lake Michican shore line.  It was leaving a pretty long trail, of hazy smoke that I thought had a greenish tint to it as well.  The oblect itself was quite bright as it was dusk and it was very easy to see from the road.  It was also very unmistakebly a very emerald green color.  At first I thought it might be a satalite burning up on re-entry.  But it plain old seemed to big for that.  I watched it for about a minute and then looked back at the road, when I looked back up it was gone ( I assumed it burned up ) It was headed roughly 340 degrees ( Compass ) from my perspective it was around 80 degrees above the horizon, I would guess the alt at roughtly 15 thousand feet.  It was definatly moveing fast.  What I find interesting is that the other reports involve it being visible from dramticly different areas, and running in different directions.  I have retold the story enough since that night to keep the details pretty solid.  Especially the color the trail and the direction it was running and where I was when I saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Observed for 20 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 10am I noticed what I first thought was a helicopter hovering above but became curious when I didn&#39;t hear any sound. As I further observed it, the movements were not what one would expect from a helicopter. At that point I told my girlfriend to come out and observe what I was seeing. I didn&#39;t tell her what I thought it was... and she excitedly said it was a UFO. You could see the glint of the sun shine off of it as it turned various directions very slowly. It did not make any quick directional changes, but did appear to slowly turn and at times got verticle to our viewpoint showing that it was definitely saucer shaped. We got my binoculars and observed it for about 15 more minutes as it got further away. The only explanation outside of it being a UFO would have to be that it was an extremely large, saucer shaped mylar balloon. The coloring was either gray or silver. Difficult to tell at the distance it was from us. My girlfriend did take several pictures with her digital camera, but of course it only appears as a dot in the images.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It also was just sitting there and was not moving, so I just keeped looking and wondering what it was. Then it moves vertically very fast like nothing i have ever seen, then it slowed down and went under the tree line, and I know a plane could not go that low so i dont know what happened.

During the evening I notice 4 falling stars within about an hours time, so when we left our friends house about 2am, we decided to drive out onto a country road and do some star gazing. The town we live in only has a population of 2500 and the nearest city is 60 miles away, so we don&#39;t need to go very far to get away from the lights, and since their was no moon, the place we stopped was completely dark.  We were laying on the hood of my car and I noticed a light moving very slowly across the sky. At first I thought it was a satellite but then I saw a second light moving parrallel with it. I pointed at the lights and asked my girlfiend if she saw them and she said &#34;What that triangle?&#34; Thats when I saw the third light following behind forming a triangle. It looked like 3 stars moving about 5 miles per hour but they stayed exactly the same distance apart. We couldn&#39;t see the craft, but the stars couldn&#39;t been seen within the area of the lights, so it was more like watching a black triangular void with a star at each point slowly moving across the sky. The craft was completely silent and looked like it was about 100&#39; above the trees. We watched the lights for about 10 minutes, until they were obstructed by the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I came out of the house for some reason I walked over to the end of the proch (about 5 feet from the door) and out of the corner of my eye I saw this bight object a few hundred feet it appeard in the sky... i thought oh a plane so i turned to look at it because I like seeing planes at night they are kinda neat... but i thought to myself as i saw it out of the corner of my eye... wait somethings not right its not blinking... how planes usually blink diffrent colors on their wings and such... and it was just hovering there... so i turned twards it to look (this is about a span of 10 seconds) and when i turned to look at it about 5 seconds into the stare at it hover it was like it knew i was looking at it... and suddenly it droped straight down behind the hill (there is a hill off in the distance about half a mile and it has trees all over it) i got a little scared at that point because that was just wierd... i knew it couldnt of been a helicopter because they dont move a few hundred feet in half a second straight down unless they are crashing and yet that is still fast at that point... so i turned away for some reason and it poped back up like it was plaing hide and seek with me... i got freaked out and went back in our house... i looked out the front window and it was there again hovering... but once agian when i looked at it... it droped down behind the hill and trees.. i stood there in shock for aboug 5 minutes then all the sudden it quickly poped back up in the air and the strangest thing happend... it grew from a relatively big spot of white to this bright yellow/orange fast flickering oval shape about 20x as big... and as it did that i got this sudden head ache that lasted from when it got big to about 30 seconds after... whic! h when it stoped it just disappeared like vanished in air...i dont know what happened... so i ran to wake up my parents (im at their house) my sister and her boy friend.. we all stood there stareing... they started making jokes i was seeing things then all the sudden about 10 minutes into the state out the window it appeared again.. this time we all saw it.. it did the same thing agian hovered and hid.. but the wierd thing.. this time when it came back it kinda snuck back from behind the hill and hid in the trees... we could see it behind the trees hovering (keep in mind this is about half a mile away) we stood there shocked for a while and it disappeared again... i called the state police and reported it the said another person just reported a similar thing in the same area when i was talking to them... then the odd thing that happend all the sudden it showed up agian but this time this trail showed up behind it kinda like a firework trail looks like as it flys up in the air.. but this trail just stayed there for about 10 seconds then just vanished.. we were really confused at that point... the last time we saw it tonight while stareing my mother and I saw it jet off in a diagonal pattern (before this it was just up and down) and it vanished... we stood there for about 30 minutes after and nothing...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must admit I am scared as heck... and not much scares me... I cant even sleep tonight, im honestly scared to... it&#39;s 4:18 in the morning right now.. this happened around midnight :\ you can see how I feel just from that... I am a religious person, and I&#39;m telling this to you with God as my whitness that this actually happened tonight... I don&#39;t think I could be more frightened then I am tonight... I have always believed in this kind of thing and always wanted to see one to prove it to myself they were real.. but after tonight, I wish I never would of seen what we saw .....<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5 people observed this occurange... Myself, my mother and father, my sister and her boyfriend<n>

She said it was the wierdest thing she has ever seen in her life and she almost stopped her car in the middle of the road to watch it.

I watched the light move in a straight line for about 8 seconds, then it disappeared for about 5 seconds and reappeared a short distance from the first sighting as though it was traveling at a constant velocity. It disappeared again and reappeared about 3 seconds later a short distance from the last appearance and going in the same direction only this time the white light got very bright and tunnel like as though a massive spotlight was shined in my direction. The spotlight effect lasted for about 3 seconds and then disappeared. After about 5 seconds I saw what looked like a comets tail in a redish orange and white mix (what was creating the tail was not visible) originating along the same line of motion as the lights but considerably farther north. This comet like tail made a large arc towards the ground and disappeared long before it would have hit the ground. It should be noted that when the light became a comet like tail, it accelerated to what I would estimate, based on seeing high altitude airlines flying at what I assume is 500 mph, to be moving at 4000+ mph. I think this may have been a decaying satelite but the white light especially the super white light with the tunnel effect has me wondering.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was the passenger and I told my friend to look at it.  It was a metal colored cylinder.  It looked like it was 3 cylinders inside if each other.  They were short cylinders and the objects were bigger around then they were tall.  It had a  flat silver metal color.  I don&#39;t know how long it lasted as we keep driving.  As we viewed it out the window it just kind of stayed in one place but we kept driving.  I was very clearly a set of round concentric circles. maybe 3 cylinders inside of each other. There is no way it was a plane.  I came here to see if anyone else reported it as there were a lot of cars out and it was close to a populated area.  Others had to of seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It seemed to have a glow around it, also. It didn&#39;t appear to have come from anywhere, it was just suddenly there. Then it appeared as if it started to fall. My first thought was a falling star but it was way too big and had no tail or anything like that. It moved very quickly. By the time I got out of the hammock and ran to the middle of the patio for a better look, it was gone. There were no sounds of aircraft. I do live between 2 small airfields but I have not seen anything move that fast, that was that big without any sound at all. This is the first ufo report I have ever filed. I can&#39;t think what this could have been which is what prompted me to do this. I am hoping someone else reports it also just so I know I didn&#39;t imagine it. My dog started barking at the same time also. So, did both the neighbors dogs, now I think of it. As for my background, I am just your average Joan, reading a book in the backyard, enjoying a nice evening before it gets unbearably hot. Since it was dark, I did have the patio light on. I also had my glasses on. I even questioned if perhaps there had been some wierd reflection but I could not recreate anything that even came close to it. I am not prone to fabrication. I am very science oriented as my entire adult life has been spent in medicine. All science and facts. Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/15/04 21:00|Miami|FL|Disk|5 seconds|Round glow passes over Miami from East to North West, faster than a jet plane at low altitude|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36965.html|180|ndxe200405| Round glow passes over Miami from East to North West, faster than a jet plane at low altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> Clear sky.  Stars visible.  Gentle breeze.  While cooking a steak on my grill, I spotted a pinkish/red DISK rushing across the sky, from east to north west.  Dut to the tree canopy above, I only saw this object for about 5 seconds.  If it was a jet plane (as was my initial thought), I expected to hear the thunder of its jets (as it would have been flying very low to cross this much sky in such a brief amount of time).  THERE WAS NO SOUND!!!  I&#39;ve been interested in UFO&#39;s for a long time (30 yrs), and must confess that I have never spotted something in the sky that I could not identify.  I was an amateur astronomer while in college, and after.  This object was definitely NOT astronomical, because of its angular motion.  It could only have been an aircraft... but there was NO sound.  The UFO could have been a baloon, but the wind speed was not strong enough to push this object across so much sky in such a brief period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was definitely round, about one-half the moon&#39;s diameter (1/4 degree?). It had a pinkish/red glow, and I think that I saw a bright spot in its center.  An aircraft (even a jet) moving this fast, would have had to been below 5,000 feet, and I would have definitely been able to resolve its navigation lights... but no.  Only one centeral fuzzy light, surrounded by a glowing ring of dust!  I&#39;ll be the first to admit it, as a trained observer, this was my first actual observation of something unidentified.  I&#39;d be interested in hearing if others in south Florida saw this this eveing!<n>
5/15/04 21:00|Jackson|NJ|Circle|10 minutes|White orb follows jet aircraft|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36978.html|181|ndxe200405| White orb follows jet aircraft<n> <n><n> <n><n> While enjoying a coffee and a cigarette in a parking lot of a local establishment, my friend and I were watching a thunderstorm roll in. We also noticed the large amount of military and/or commercial air traffic in the area at the time. We are relatively close to several military installations, and not far off from at least three international airports, so large amounts of air traffic are not unusual. Suddenly, upon gazing up into the sky at one point, I noticed two conventional aircraft that appeared to be flying in the same direction relatively close together, almost as if flying in formation. I advised my friend of this, who noted it as well. What we both also noted, however, that just off the right - tail of the aircraft on the right, matching its speed, was a solid white light - almost an orb. It was bright and appeared almost as if a star was moving accross the sky. It appeared to be following the jet on the right. The jet on the left began moving in a more norternly direction while the jet on the right continued moving more on a due east track. The white light appeared to follow the jet on the right for an additional brief period of time. Eventually, the white light appeared to track on an even more easternly direction, thus no longer following the plane. We watched this white as it continued all the way out into the distance where it was no longer visible. That strange thing is that this light had no strobes or flashing lights or anything you would expect to be on a normal aircraft. It was simply a steady white light. Very odd. And the fact that it was so close to a larger jet aircraft was even more odd. I wish I had thermal imaging gear or even a pair of standard binoculars so that I could have made out the aircrafts structure. For all I know, it was a plane. It did not take any actions or manuvers that were out of this world. It did not change color or shape. It just simply moved at roughly the same speed as two aircraft which were lighted in such a way that one could identify ! them as aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

5/15/04 20:00|Scarborough (Canada)|ON|Other||HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  At first I saw one small pink-red light at cloud level traveling parallel.|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37126.html|182|ndxe200405| At first I saw one small pink-red light at cloud level traveling parallel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Full Description of event/sighting: At dusk (approx 7:50-8:00 pm) on May 15 2004, from my home in East Scarborough near Lake Ontario, looking south towards the lake, some moving lights in the sky caught my attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were confined to a fairly small area of the *sky* and seemed to be at about cloud level. My guess is the lights were moving about perhaps a few miles off our shoreline, and would likely have been high enough and far enough over the lake to also have been visible from the US side of the lake. It had been an overcast day and the sky at this time was clearing. It wasn&#39;t nearly dark enough yet to observe any stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I saw one small pink-red light at cloud level traveling parallel to the ground and in a straight line moving from east to west at about the same rate as I&#39;d expect to see planes travel. This light flashed on and off with a regular rhythm like an aircraft and was about the same size as an aircraft light seen at such a distance. It seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, then traveled west for perhaps 5 seconds and disappeared. I thought I had seen and then lost sight of a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly from the very same place in the sky that the light originally appeared, and only seconds after the first light vanished, another light appeared. It was the same colour and behaved exactly like the first light, even traveling in the very same line. It too disappeared in the same manner as the first light. This behavior of a light appearing, traveling for a few seconds across the sky and then disappearing repeated 6-10 times. After a few passes the reappearing light ceased flashing as it moved across the sky. It glowed a reddish pink colour and without blinking as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The behavior of the light then changed. Suddenly the light was moving from west to east and towards the end of the sighting it seemed that there might have been more than one light in play. Just as one vanished another appeared. The direction of flight changed to a sweeping arc. The flight started parallel to the ground and then curved steeply upwards and seemed to accelerate just before disappearing. There seemed to be a distinct repetitive pattern to the flight of the light(s). As one light moved from east to west, arcing at the end of its flight, another light mirrored that pattern by flying west to east and then arced upwards at the end. The area the lights were &#34;playing&#34; in the sky drifted higher and a little to the east as the sighting continued. It also seemed that the activity of the lights became more intense towards the end. They appeared and disappeared more quickly and the flight pattern became more energetic. The best thought that comes to mind is it appeared that they were growing increasingly excited about something as the activity became quite hectic towards the end. The display of these lights lasted about 5 minutes and was witnessed by a friend with me at the time. His impression was that the lights were chasing each other, as in a dogfight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight pattern reminded me of when you see a powerful spot light beamed in the sky circling and moving about, starting and finishing its routine in the same place every time. These lights were a lot like what you see when you use a red laser pointer, except the colour of the lights in the sky were less intense red than a laser, rather being an almost pink sort of colour. Since the cloud cover was quite thin at this time it&#39;s unlikely that some sort of laser was beaming around on the cloud cover (If it was an extremely powerful laser I would have seen the lights fade in and out as the beam struck thin patches of clouds. The lights I saw held intensity as they flew across the sky before vanishing suddenly.)  There was no sound accompanying this sighting and I think the flight behavior was too radical for normal aircraft. The speed and turns were not something I&#39;ve ever seen planes capable of doing, particularly without making sound. The regular flashing of the lights in the beginning was aircraft-like, but the reddish-pink colour was unusual. I got the feeling while watching the lights that I was seeing glowing objects, something without mass (like the spot made by a laser) rather than a solid aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In such an urban area as this I can&#39;t imagine that my friend and I were the only two people to have seen this blatant display of something quite unusual right out in the open and in daylight. Surely our beaches and boardwalks, which provide a perfect view of the southern sky, were busy on Saturday after dinner and many people could have seen this event. I&#39;ve checked into all the major local news sources, newspapers, radio and local TV news and haven&#39;t seen a mention of this event. I hope to learn what it was that we saw, or at least hear accounts from other witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

Traffic was at a halt and I|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36971.html|184|ndxe200405| Spotted Mylar Balloon looking object revolving as it floated above Hollywood Freeway by Vermont Ave. exit. Traffic was at a halt and I had plenty of opportunity to watch. It seemed like a party balloon but was moving /revolving really slowly in clockwise rotation in what was a pretty good wind / breeze. Not sure which way wind was traveling. The &#34;Balloon&#34; was orange and black and appeared to have 3 or four glowing dots on one side that were distinctive from orange and black two tone body color. It just very slowly, in the strong breeze, seemed to rotate up towards the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It gets better!  I got off the freeway and was stopped at light so I peered at the object spinning slowly up then I said to myself there must be something else up in the sky. I turned my head further up towards the silvery blue thin clould blanketed L.A. sky and then saw the glowing light flying in a straight line from west to east! As itwas flying I said &#34;come on no way I&#39;m seeing a Mexico City Style orb&#34; to myself then it stopped moving straight and cut a 90 degree turn down towards the ground and kinda zig zaged for a few seconds then stopped in Place near or above clouds! The street light turned green, nobody honked and I moved to quickly park! and view  I pulled my car into a McDonald&#39;s parking lot at Vermont around Santa Monica or Melrose and parked next too of all things a trailer filled with Horses. Wild! I backered my car up and was able to view both objects. My sunroof, which is huge, offered a great tinted view of light orb, foo fighter. The &#34;Balloon&#34; now stopped rotating and showed me the side with the three or four glowing dots as it moved slowly in a straight line up and away towards the north / clouds. When I turned back towards orb it had changed shape and position slightly more east and had become a white &#34;I&#34; shape standing tall against clouds. I watched both objects for about five minutes as the &#34;balloon slowly faded and blink of eye disappeared way before clouds. And the white &#34;I&#34; stayed in a stationary position for a few minutes after Balloon had disappeared, then poof it was gone!  Another interesting point was that the horses didn&#39;t seem to pleased, maybe the heat or traveling but they seemed in snyc with what was happening above, making some annoyed gruf sounds. Wild day in Hollywood!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>
5/15/04 14:30|Portland|OR|Rectangle|10 minutes|Dark Cylinder/ Rectangular flying object dips in and out of low clouds over Portland, Oregon|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37065.html|185|ndxe200405| Dark Cylinder/ Rectangular flying object dips in and out of low clouds over Portland, Oregon<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personal Testament of Experience on 5/15/04 in Portland, Oregon Last Saturday, my next door neighbor and I went on a bike ride down the east side bike path in Portland.  We stopped by a friend’s work during her lunch break and then continued on our bike ride down towards the Steel Bridge.  We went under the Burnside Bridge on the bike/walk dock and neighbor stopped suddenly on her bike in front of me.  I thought that something was wrong with her bike at first because she stopped so abruptly.  I came to a stop behind her and looked up to where she was looking.  We both saw what seemed to be a huge metallic pipe floating in the sky.  The sky was covered with very low clouds and scattered light showers.  The pipe was moving slowly from the north in and out of the clouds and then began moving south parallel with I-5, but more so above the east side of Portland.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the bike ride I was in the process of photographing Portland’s bridges for my grandfather who is a retired civil engineer.  I remembered that I had my digital camera with and scrambled to pull it out of my bike bag.  I began to photograph the object in the sky (between 2:00 pm and 2:30 pm on 5/ 15/ 04).  Once I started taking pictures the object leveled out, flattened, and moved slowly towards us.  I took the picture and looked around to see if anyone else noticed this thing.  I was surprised when I realized that virtually no one else was out on the dock that afternoon.  There was one runner, a woman that glanced up and over her shoulder when she ran by to see what we were staring at.  She did not stop to look and I doubt that she saw the object from the angle at which she turned her head.  We did not say anything to the runner because we were completely stunned by what we thought we were experiencing.  The object remained flat and continued to hover above us.  I took a couple more pictures and then I got a really weird feeling that I should not be taking these photos.  I put my camera down out of respect for the object (I don’t know why).  Neighbor and I just stared at the pipe/ or disk (looked more like a pipe-disk the closer it came because I could see a slight bend at each corner).  I can not tell if it was my eyes playing tricks on me or the pipe emanating energy towards us.  It looked like a shifting aura or something that was pulsing towards us.  Something like a light or small sun beams that break through clouds, but it was not very bright and rather bluish-white-grayish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then decided to us my video mode on digital camera because I knew my other friend would not believe what I had seen if I did not have moving footage.  Unfortunately I cannot zoom in on video mode like I am able to with still shots, but I worked with what I had.  I began to film the object and it began to move away from us heading east.  I filmed the I-5 and then back to the sky to put the event in perspective.  The object continued to move away and then turned slightly to the left/ north.  It began to move further away and I stopped filming because I was frightened.  When the object was close I was not scared but more so in awe of the event, however, when the object moved away I began to panic because I felt I had seen something I should not have (don’t know why again).  I felt that the object was still watching us even though now behind the clouds. I also felt that the object could hear us or knew what we were thinking.  I then turned to neighbor and made her promise that we would not tell anyone, out of respect towards whatever that was.  We expressly agreed with a hand shake (in my head I figured that they needed to see this) and got back on our bikes and headed north towards the steel bridge slowly.  We could still see the object but I just wanted to get out there.  The object dipped back down out of the clouds and then went up and slightly towards to north out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were riding away I checked to see if neighbor was all right.  I felt funky through my entire body and pretty confused (not to the point of disorientation though).  She asked me why I wanted to know if she was all right, I did not answer her and continued to ride across the bridge.  We barely said a word to each other for the rest of the ride, only a “what the hell was that” every now and then.  When I got home I put the pictures in my computer and I was surprised to see that the camera picked up the object on video.  I showed neighbor and we really didn’t talk about it much until later that night after we had a couple beers.  We totally broke our earlier agreement because the excitement of what had happened earlier hit us after a few beers.  We decided to show the photos only to people that we thought could appreciate them.  The more we showed the photos, the more we wanted to continue to show the photos.  Many of our friends say that they got chills when they viewed the pictures on my computer.  It really was exciting for everyone and I am glad to a certain extent that we broke the agreement to not tell anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not contacted this web page sooner than today because I am fearful of the ramifications.  I am fearful of the secrecies within government and I am ignorant to whatever it was that was looking back at us on the dock.  I hope that by sharing this story and pictures with everyone will help in some way.  I don’t know how it will help but I know that it was one of the most amazing things I have seen occur in the sky.  The next day I went to the ocean for a friend’s birthday and took a picture of my first whale.  This little camera is the best investment I have made this year.  Thanks for listening, there are few more post sighting experiences that I have not included because I do not know if they are relevant…I don’t even know what I experienced.  I would like to talk with someone in person before I share any of that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All we have is a moment<n>

After a few seconds of viewing the plane, I noticed a black &#34;dot&#34; in the sky above the plane. It danced around for a minute, and then disappeared. Before it disappeared, I snapped a few shots. Unfortunately the pictures came out pretty poorly, but I did manage to get a shot with plane and the dot in the view. I could see the object more clearly in person than what the photo reveals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was perfectly round, and black, and moved in a darting fashion. At first I thought I was watching a balloon, but it moved too fast in too many directions, then zipped off to the south in a split second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got one good usable picture, and would love to send it to you. I bought the camera/binoculars due to the high sighting frequency I have been having in this area. This is about the fourth sighting in the month of May for myself and my son. One evening about a week ago, we were awakened to a loud vibrating sound, which thought was an earthquake. When we ran out to the porch, we saw two lighted oval shaped objects steaking across the sky at unbelievable speeds. We also saw a UFO/craft flying over the Army Base in Dublin, CA that appeared to be shaped like an egg and was bright white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will keep my eyes on the sky, and tonight I plan to go UFO hunting with my son up in the hills. If I see something, I will report it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

She told her sister to look and see saw them too. The objects appeared to be moving around and getting closer. The girls got scared and yelled look to the other 5 or so students that were also at the bus stop. But before any one else looked, the ufo&#39;s took off at a high rate of speed and disappeared before the other kids saw them. The other kids just looked at the girls strange because they didn&#39;t see anything. The girls were scared and didn&#39;t tell them what they saw. After the two girls told me what they saw,I questioned them carefully not to ask them any leading questions. They said the objects were close like a small private airplane and as far as they could tell, about the same size. They used to be very uncomfortable about talking about it, but now they don&#39;t mind. There were high clouds in the sky, the sun was just coming up and they were looking to the North standing at the corner of Vine St. and Arbor Dr. 5 miles West of Willow Run Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I walked outside to observe the sunrise and noticed a small silvery stationary object several miles up glistenig in the early morning sunrays..At first I thought it was a planet, but it was too large (slightly larger than a pin head held at arms length), then perhaps a weather ballon..however what got my attention was that as the sky became just a little brighter, the object rapidly lost its refelction and within 5-10 seconds totally disapperared from view.  It seemed to take on the same color as the surrounding clear blue sky, and could not be seen after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I awoke a 3:30 a.m., it was Saturday, May 15, 2004. A light was shining at me through the east window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t think much of it but it woke me up, so, I flipped over in bed and looked out of the window behind my head, (South Facing) and I thought I saw a plane but after a few seconds I realized it wasn&#39;t a plane because it was large and triangular with two flashing lights on each tip. My mind was trying to convince me that maybe its a new type of plane or something but a couple of seconds later an orb came our of the top of it and went straight up into the sky. It scared the crap out of me. I have always believed there were other life forms out there but to actually see it is pretty disconcerting. Just wondering if anyone else reported a sighting that night.

I am reporting this event for my sister(who called me directly to report it) She claims Sat May 15 2004 (12:30AM) over Towson Maryland she saw several objects over her townhouse-She reports a conscious sighting of a grey entity in her home-feelings of giddiness-almost drunk/high feeling-unlike anything she remembers/experiences--she claims minimally 35 minutes of &#34;time loss&#34;. She has requested a complete investigation-describes the entity as an &#34;old friend&#34;. Contact was made with her telepathically-she claims feelings of peacefulness and claims entity seemed to keep expressing concern for her-she has had other UFO sightings and claims this is her second contact(that she is aware of).I am convinced of the strong possibility of multiple contactees within the family. This will require a rather large investigation to cover Maryland-Virginia-South Carolina-and New York Mufon Investigators-maybe more-the story is potentially large and unique-though I havent written to Budd Hopkins I feel it is an investigation that may be worthy of his expertise. Confidentiality is requested as we begin to take steps to come face to face with this investigation &amp; results.You may contact me through my e-mail &amp; advise as to the best way to begin this investigation-I am at present contacting family members to discuss and seek approval for whoever wishes to discuss this case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to contact the individuals, and put him in touch with a local investigator.

CLEARLY TRIANGULAR.|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73418.html|194|ndxe200405| My friend and I were at a graduation party at a friend&#39;s house in Valley Center (Just a little North East of Wichita) we were out by the cars talking about random stuff.  (THERE WAS NO DRINKING AT THE PARTY... EVERYONE WAS SOBER) There was a light wind, but not too strong.  We were sitting on the hood of my car; Nick&#39;s girlfriend just went inside.  We weren’t looking up but we noticed something.  We got really quiet.  There was literally no sound what-so-ever.  The dogs, horses, and all other stuff were utterly quiet.  What we saw were three lights.  (JUST LIKE THE ONE ON THE IMAGE YOU HAVE FLYING OVER THE OUTLINE OF MISSOURI)  It came in from the north and made no sound at all.  It flew directly south... STRAIGHT SOUTH!!!  It moved extremely slowly.  It made a hard right turn and it was at this time that it broke the speed it had moved at the whole time.  It moved faster, but not real fast.  We watched it go toward the horizon until we couldn’t tell the dif! ference between it and the stars.  When it passed overhead, it was low enough that the lights from the garage seemed to reflect off of it.  Literally, it seemed to be only a few hundred feet off the ground.  I have to say, it made NO SOUND AT ALL.  Until it turned, it never broke speed.  In turning, it didn&#39;t actually turn.  but just changed directions.  It was unmistakably a triangle.  CLEARLY TRIANGULAR.  See, in Wichita there is an Air Force Base (McConnell AFB) talked about it for a while.  We both thought when it flew overhead that it was a B2 Bomber, but IT MADE NO SOUND and when it turned, we knew it wasn&#39;t a bomber.  We know what we saw.  I haven&#39;t talked to myfriend in a year, but I’m sure I could get a hold of him.  If you want any more information, I’d be glad to give it to you.  I told my parents and some friends about it, but it wasn&#39;t until I saw your logo that I thought someone would believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: Follow up yielded no additional info except that it was as big as a 747. additional witness could not be locted. The logo he is talking about is the logo on the MIG - Missouri Investigators Group website. http://ufomig.bravehost.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP, and to its Director, BARBARA BECKER, for their having shared this report with our Center.

Me and a group of people saw 5 strange brilliant lights of colours moving in the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> hello, im from argentina, and a few weeks ago, i was in a river called &#34;rio de la plata&#34; in my boat, and i remember that there were many people with me at that time, because people often stay and sleep on their boats in this river. Just as my clock hit midnight, me and the group of people that were on their boats were attracted by brilliant lights of many colours in the sky, they were too brilliant and too close to be a star and they moved soo fast that it was impossible for them to be a plane. At first they just hovered in circles, and a few minutes later, they went down very fast. When this happened people got scared because they thought it was a meteor, and i remember some woman scream. but a few seconds later it went back up hovered in circles a little more and then just dissapeared in the sky. Im not really a big believer of ufos and that things, but the next day in the newspaper &#34;La Nacion&#34;, appeared a big article talking about this light that apparently more than the people that were in the river saw, and that until today no-one has figured out what it was. Well, that&#39;s my &#34;ufo-experience&#34;. Y si no me creen, pueden fijarse en el diario &#34;La Nacion&#34; y buscar OVNI y les va a aparecer<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I accutally had to think again if I did see it. There are no wires or trees in the area to reflect local traffic lights. It was slim and long. Not sure if it was a cirgar type object. Had a white glow to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no noise and if I had to judge the speed. It was fast. And when it made it&#39;s turn it did not even stop or slow down. Also when it turned not sure if it bent while making the turn or if it just moved as one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If it did show up on a radar. As there is an international airport near by.

Half way there my friend needed to tie his shoe laces. As he began to tie his shoe I decided to sit on the floor because I was tired from the walk. Before I knew it he was already asking me to get up and start walking so we would get there faster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after he said that I looked up at him to ask him to give me a minute, But before i had a chance just to do that I saw what appeared to be a v-shaped UFO flying across the sky at a very fast speed. This UFO was a baby blue and it was glowing in the night sky. As I watched in amazement I could not do anything but point at the the UFO as it flew by.My friend got a good look at it for about a good 3 seconds, I saw it for 7.(I&#39;m only guessing.)The UFO was flying across the sky in a perfect straight direction eventually disapearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We couldn&#39;t make it out, but what we did see was a very large deep black triangle with a light at each tip that looked like a star, or in other words 3 stars in a triangle shape, moving slowly NW to SE. It took about 7 minutes for the craft to move out of my sight. I had time to run into the house and grab the video cam with &#34;nightshot&#34;, but am uncertain if anything showed up on it as I haven&#39;t yet viewed the tape. It was difficult to try to acquire it in the viewfinder as it was way up there and I had to keep looking from the camera to acquire it visually and then attempt to get it in the camera frame. I know it wasn&#39;t three satellites moving in tandem as stars that it passed over were blocked out from view. My wife could see it at first, but then lost it as she has difficulty with her contacts at night, but is a security officer at the toxic waste facility here and has reported to me that she has seen this object before during night shifts. This is my first siting of this nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I&#39;m used to seeing satellites and noticed a particularly bright one only after watching it travel in a straight line I noticed that it started moving in an s formation then more erratically... initially i thought it was an illusion because the wind was blowing, and the object was moving toward the top of two tall trees in his backyard after moving myself toward the houes and making sure it was not an illusion of the trees i remarked to my dad who also noted its movements which at this point became several small movements in the same general area like it was &#34;hovering&#34; and adjusting itself...we were facing north and the object was straight up above and a bit to the north the object was white and very bright, also it seemed at a very high altitude.. after watching this for about five minutes we agreed tht it was just us but before going back inside we noted that the object had all but vanished.. i feel that the object was all to hight to be a helicopter and moved like no other aircraft id ever seen...<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was 10:30 at night on friday may 14 in the parking lot of Cleats. Me and 4 others just got done eating and watching a band (Didnt Drink). We stood outside the car for 15 minutes and waited for someone. I just looked in the sky for no reason and saw 3 stars kinda next to each other. I must have looked at it for maybe about a minute and then the star (or what ever) on the left took off at an incredible speed. I emediatly pointed and said WTF and only 2 of my friends caught it. I have never seen anything travel at that speed before. It was at zero to who knows how fast in a split second. Thats not the scary part, it started off almost right above me and ended up all the way across the sky and then seemed to hit something and made a 90 degree turn north and disappeared. It was almost like it hit a ball and bounced off. It was oranger (if thats a word) then the stars it was by. I dont believe in aliens and i dont believe the US has anything capable of doing that. I feel it was just a unexplained mystery that has to do with space. Maybe a star getting sucked into a black hole. I dont have pictures or videos and didnt see a shape just a colored light.It also seemed verry far away, (Like a star) not like a plane. Call me crazy, your not the first. My friend said it moved in a back and forth motion but I think it just went straight.  Please Email me if you had any other reports about this or like it.  Thanks<n>

We are in the souther hemisphere and this was about 20 degrees north of vertical.  I thought it was a bit odd so I looked at it for about a minute or two.  Their were two or three stars around it so I could determine it was stationary or possibly moving away from me.  Then it dimmed significantly and began to move directly north looking much like a satilite does when in sunlight.  It disappeared after travelling across the night sky for about 30 seconds.  This was even stranger as satilites that are commonly seen in Australia always travel from West to East and are never stationary then move.  I can only speculate that it was a stationary satilite that conducted a burn to move into a higher orbit ?<n>

So we decided to go with our three dogs upstairs to our apartment roof top and watch the stars. We were laying on deck chairs facing the sky. My dog was on my lap and she could not take her eyes off the sky. Looking passed her gaze, I saw five huge spheres in the distance silently gliding rapidly and gracefully above me, having come from the direction of the pier. I was struck at first watching them. Then I alerted my boyfriend and he saw them too. We watched them as they headed north out of our view. At first thought we both thought they were bubbles. But, no way they were too big. Then balloons entered our minds, but no way. They didn&#39;t move like balloons. They were in formation and they were gliding rapidly in a straight line (faster than the planes in the sky) in uniform across the sky. They gave off no noise. They weren&#39;t giving off any reflective light. They were transparent, but they clearly had a shape to them like soap bubbles.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
5/14/04 21:40|Santa Rosa|CA|Circle|45 sec|Orange circular object moved quickly to NE and was followed almost to the horizon.|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37046.html|206|ndxe200405| Orange circular object moved quickly to NE and was followed almost to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking my dog, noticed directly overhead a moving yellow-orange circular object that looked like Jupiter but was 50% larger. Jupiter was nearby, a little more to the west, and just below the constellation of Leo. This moving object headed straight NE at a speed that convinced me that it had to be a satellite. It had the same deliberate and steady motion. I was able to follow it to within a few degrees above the NE horizon. As it receded, it not only became smaller but also decidedly more orange. Since it still had considerable angular speed when it approached the horizon, it convinced me that it was following the earth in a circular orbit. Based on these observations, I would have to conclude that I had seen an unknown satellite. What puzzles me though is the fact that about 1.5 hours after sunset, it should have blinked out at an elevation of about 22.5 degress as it entered the Earth&#39;s shadow. It did not do that and I could follow it almost to the horizon to within about 2 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This occurred shortly after sunset while there was still twilight in the west. The craft flew due east in my direction - I was seated on a picnic table next to a softball field and close to home plate. The craft flew fast and low over the ball field at an altitude of 15-20 feet and passed by me at a distance of about 150 feet to the south of me. It passed underneath an electric line running along the right field line and under another line that ran along the center field fence. It then left the ball field and climbed to pass over a building in an apartment complex, located on the east side of the ball field. The craft then dropped out of sight on the other side of the building. I continued to look in the direction of the apartments. Less than a minute later, the craft reappeared on the north side of the apartments, directly to the east of me. It then rose to an altitude of about 50 feet and slowly moved toward me.  It passed to the north of me at a distance of 100 feet or less from me. It then turned south and appeared to land at the south end of a parking lot, which is located on the west side of the ball field, about 150-200 feet from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft then rotated to face me and then began to move toward me slowly and low over the ground. At this point I became somewhat afraid and left the park in my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was black in color and had a single white light on the front of it. Because it was getting dark, I could make out no further detail other than its shape and approximate size. I estimate the diameter of the craft to be 10-15 feet. Its shape is what I would describe to be a &#34;classic&#34; saucer shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt the need to go someplace where there were other people (I was alone in the park), so I drove to a Walmart store, located about three blocks east of the park. As I entered the parking lot, I saw a white light flying eastward to the south of Walmart. It then made a large U turn and flew directly over Walmart at an altitude of less than 100 feet and then headed southwest and disappeared. I went into Walmart for about 10 minutes to make a purchase. When I came out, I saw a white light flying circles, altitude of 100 feet or less, over an apartment complex located just east of Walmart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am assuming this white light was the saucer I saw earlier at the park, but the body of the craft wasn&#39;t visible at this point because the sky was too dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I knew, I was the only witness to the craft&#39;s activities. I went to a tavern located in a strip mall just northeast of Walmart to find someone I knew who could be a witness. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t know any of the people who were in the tavern at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed at the tavern for a time, occasionally stepping outside to see if the craft was still in the vicinty and saw it again on two more occasions. Both times, I saw it hovering over the east end of Walmart at a height of 75-100 feet. The first time, the craft began to move toward the southeast and then turned north. It passed low over the apartment complex and then over a service station. The body of the craft was briefly visible as it passed over the service station. The craft continued north and then made a sharp turn west. I then lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back into the tavern and came out again about 15-20 minutes later. Once more, it was hovering over Walmart in the same place. This was my final, and most bizarre, sighting of the craft. The craft began to move on the same course as before, but this time it turned directly toward me instead of passing over the service station. It came at me fast and very low over the parking lot of the strip mall, came very close to me and then simply vanished. I looked all around me, even directly above me, but couldn&#39;t see it. I have no idea where it went. Because this happened so quickly and because I was somewhat stunned by what happened, I really couldn&#39;t discern any further details of the craft&#39;s appearance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I re-entered the tavern and came out again a short time later. I didn&#39;t see the craft this time, so I went home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About me: I am a 50-year old male. I have bachelor degrees in journalism and business, with work experience in both fields. At present, I am part owner of a computer store. This was my only &#34;real&#34; encounter with a UFO. In the past, I have seen lights in the night sky that I couldn&#39;t identify, but I had never seen a &#34;flying saucer&#34; before this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I arrived at a customer&#39;s house at exactly 10:30.  I know this for a fact because they told me last night to get there on time because they&#39;d be gone until then.  Their home is in a remote country setting, and is heavily wooded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The job was a routine one, one that I anticipated would take exactly an hour.  I&#39;ve owned this business for ten years and can predict almost to the minute how long each job will take to do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back in my truck to leave the job, my cell phone (which was in my pocket the whole time) said 11:30, exactly what I predicted it would say.  However, the clock in my truck said 12:30.  I called my fiancee, and the first words out of her mouth were, &#34;Where have you been for so long?&#34;  When I arrived home, all of the clocks said 12:45, whereas my cell phone still was one hour behind.  More shocking still was that her cell phone was reading the correct time, 12:45 PM.  She and I are on the same cell phone plan, and our clocks are always right in sync with each other.  They even automatically change when daylight savings time starts &amp; ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, I&#39;m freaking out right now.  I&#39;ve called my customer asking how long I was at his home &amp; I&#39;m waiting for him to respond.  If he says, &#34;About an hour&#34; I will most likely call your hotline number and check out some other websites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please let me know if anyone else had a similar experience this morning.  I don&#39;t even believe in this stuff and need an explanation.  I don&#39;t drink or take drugs, and I got a good night&#39;s sleep last night, so I know my mind was stable.  Thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I spoke with the contractor on 7/16/04 asking if he could give an explanation or had any idea why he felt he had an hour of missing time.  He said that he believed he was overly tired and had worked too many hours in the days preceding what he believed was the missing hour.  I asked if any other abnormal events took place prior to the missing hour such as seeing a UFO or anything out of the ordinary and his response was no. The gentlman sounded sincere in his answers but felt that nothing our of the ordinary had happened except that time just got away fom him without his knowledge due to being tired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My conclusion to this investigation is nothing more then losing time due to mental fatigue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Donnie Blessing Southern Ohio Section Director MUFON<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Donnie Blessing, and to MUFON/Ohio, for sharing their follow-up report regarding the alleged event.

On this night I just happened to look over the St. Marys river between the tree line and noticed a VERY bright reddish orange light from where I was standing at approx. 245 degrees compass heading  moving so fast and erratically that it was at first a blur.  I thought that it was at first a helicopter from the  national guard-[they fly over the river often]- and moving so strangely I thought it was in trouble. The longer I watched though the less rapid the movement became and the VERY distinct outline became apparent. The object still had the same basic colors but was more red on the upper side and lighter toward the orange hue on the lower side. The movement was still jerkyand would move up and down and side to side quite rapidly. The longer I watched the more it seemed to stabilize and at once dropped straight  down. As I continued to watch it rose again and at approx. 200ft. the bottom became VERY white in color and a [what I would call] vortex began to form beneath it and to &#34;my&#34; eye it looked to be drawing what looked like water withen the vortex rising to the now very stable object. This lasted for about 5min. and as suddenly as it started, it quit! The vortex seemed to expand so quickly it looked similar to when someone would pop a balloon filled with water. The resulting mist expanded and the lighe from the lower side of the objece made a beautiful light show for a few seconds-[under a min.]. This is not the first time I have seen this exact same design of this type. I was raised in the Oceola national forest and as a child with my grandmother we would see these sights often and in &#34;many&#34; different forms and colors. She reffered to them as Gods lights. I have &#34;always&#34; believed in the fact that there is something about this we do not totally understand but this was the first time I saw this type of an action-and &#34;so close&#34;! The object when it performed this action could have not been more than 1/2 mile away and was large enough to be seen with extreme detail and clarity.The depiction in pictures one sees oh this type of craft is perfect in every way. The government with their continuing denial of these objects insults anyones intelligence when they say they are seeing what does not exist. The fact that within the hour of this sighting the military had a sky full if their own &lt;flying&gt; objects. The difference is they were noisy and quite stable in flight. I was in the Air Force [SAC] and have as much time in the air as most private pilots will get in any 5 years and I am more than familiar with most unusual things that are seen and meet no known description, but when something is this close---THERE IS NO DOUBT---what is seen!I have been asked why, if this so common that I don&#39;t take photos? You really cannot get one that is clear enough to be able to discern the objects as they appear to the naked eye. Anyone who has tried knows this is so! I just watch and enjoy our visitors antics that I have known for so long. Disbelivers---BELIEVE! There is no problem to see this if you spend any 1 month near this area and observe mostly at night in the early morning hours. The daytime can also be active in the summer months if you have tine to lie on your back and just watch! As a child this was a daily and nightly ritual. It us so. Believe it or not-[to coin  a phrase]!<n>

They came into my view as they rose above a parking structure, but were in the distance in the northwest.  They were rising straight up towards the sky at a fairly quick speed.  The lights were slighty larger than the stars in the sky.  Once it reached the &#39;handle&#39; of the Big Dipper (about 20 seconds) it seemed to have paused for a moment then headed southeast across the sky.  As it passed over me it was sioulletted by the moonlight and I noticed it had a triangular shape, but slighty rounded. It was about 1/8 the size of the moon and seemed to be quite a distance away.  It dissapeared from my sight (about 25 seconds later) when it became obstructed by the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was obvious that they were very far away,and at a very high altitude. At first we thought they were satellites moving across the sky at the same time, but what really got our attention was that the real stars were blocked when the triangle shape moved across them. The thing must have been huge. It continued to move north at a slow pace and eventually moved out of sight. From the time we first noticed it, untill it was gone took about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

So the two ladies went outside to have a look for the crying cat when the porch light suddenly went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the ladies looked up into the sky and towards the west and noticed a light traveling through the sky heading in their direction which was towards the east. She thought it may have been a satellite or a airplane. But the light was far to low in altitude for it to be a satellite and there was no sound or any flashing lights so she ruled out a plane of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the white light approached closer and over top of their home it grew much brighter, extremely bright she said. The object continued it&#39;s flight towards the east and at one point the ladies Mother saw another light coming towards the one they were already watching, but the second light was traveling from the north and heading to the south. As both witnesses watched, the lights met up in the night sky and blinked out as they crossed each other&#39;s path.

I went to the front door, which faces northwest, and looked out. Through the trees, slightly towards the west, where I usually see Venus in the evenings, I saw a bright, yellowish light flickering through the tree branches. I watched for a few seconds trying to determine if it might just be Venus I was seeing and realized that this was something different. I stepped out onto the front porch to get a better look. I had to crouch down to get a view of it without the obstruction of the tree branches. As I watched, the light grew in size and brightness and changed to a ruddy color. (At its largest, it was twice the size of Venus). It then began to drop what looked like blobs of red light toward the ground. It did this for about ten seconds at which time its intensity dwindled down to a pinpoint and the color back towards yellow. After a few seconds it became very bright and red and again rained down several large blobs of red. Another couple of minutes and it winked out completely.

I saw a light about the size of Saturn in appearence fy West to East overhead and it grew to about the size of Venus when overhead.  I had a pair of 8X35 binoculars I was going out to look at comet NEATS with.  I could not resolve a shape even though I was hoping to resolve an aircraft.  It was extremely high and fast moving, about 1/2 the speed of a satalite at least.  I thought it was the Space Station at first and asked my wife if she wanted ot see it.  She declined and I realized it was not at all what I thought.  There were dead-calm conditions and it was completely silent.  About 5-10 minute later 2 military fighters flew over (I could hear them, well sounded like 1 but was 2).  I am familiar with the stealth sound and various looks and also some other aircraft that have not been publically discussed.  I have watched them for months with abilities and conditions not normal in understood conventional aircraft.  After a while the skies were full of aircraft (jets) and at that time the weather changed radically (maybe totally unrelated but occured).  My wife, a special education teacher for 8 years, will verify I asked her to come out and look at somthing odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed an object, reddish in color, and angular, moving much slower than the airplane and quite a bit higher moving in almost the same direction, northwest to southeast. I then noticed quite a bit higher than this object was a small black dot, moving at exactly the same rate of speed as the reddish object, as though they were attached. My initial thought was a ballon or kite, but these objects were way higher than the the airplane. I ran inside to get my digital camera. I tried to focus on the objects,, but they did not show up in my viewfinder. I took pictures anyway. The object continued to move at a very slow pace until it was almost directly overhead, when my brother returned from a trip to the store. He immediately saw the objects as well. I gave him my camera nad told him to keep taking pictures while I went to get my video camera. When I came back, inoticed three or four of my neighbors also pointing and looking at the object. I tried to find the object in my camera viewfinder, but it did not show up. I took footage anyway. The object continued on a straight line, seemed to be gaining in altitude, until it went out of site. As a side note, I had no trouble at all getting Venus to come into focus on my digital camera, an Olympus C2100 UZ. I am in the process of transferring the images to my computer for further analysis.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The passenger and I both recognized a golden peach colored blob in the distance almost at the exact same time. We quickly agreed it was on a direct path for my vehicle and just as my friend suggested &#34;i think it&#39;s a meteorite,&#34; I slowed down and the golden peach colored blob became a large defined triangle with bright light blue circular lights that ran horizontally across the bottom of the craft. The Chevron (gas) symbol is very similar to what the craft resembled, but it was a peachy color. As my friend leaned foward to get a better view he shouted, &#34; There it is!&#34; The craft did an about face and disappeared quicker than anything I&#39;ve seen.

In May last year I was photographing the moon using an slr mounted on a tripod, cable release, 70mm lens, 400 asa film. The exposure times varied between less than a second to maybe 1 minute, you can tell by the streaks left by the stars. when I took the photographs there was nothing in the sky, when I had got them back, there was a very unmistakeable light near the moon. In the first photo it was directly in line with the moon, then as the moon moved in its orbit the light stayed where it was, which was for something like 15 20 minutes which can be vairifed by the amount of motion of the moon. The photographs were developed at a commerical lab the original preview is included.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the next night I did the same, this time the moon rose later and so was in a completely different spot. When I got the photos back there was the light again obviously infra red or similar. Again it was near the moon and therefore had to move their to be in the photo. The next night I did the same but there was no light, then the night after I again photographed the moon and it was back again, and again in a completely different positon but still near the moon. those photographs are in the first album. to give some perspective, I have included a photo of the moon taken with a 400mm lens, it is still samller than the light and nowhere near as bright. You will also notice that in the photo of the moon the background is very dark and there are no stars visible and no trees or clouds visible even though I included trees in the shot to gain some perspective. This means that the light needed to be close enough to light the trees, as well as provide the added light energy to make the stars visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the second album the photographs were taken in january this year, there were similar exposure times some shorter some a little longer yet it is much brighter and obviously closer as it clearly lights up the roof and trees, you can see clouds and stars and the background is visible unlike the moon photos that are just black. again I have included the original preview from the photo lab which is a different lab again, I also have the original film. These were taken at a completely different angle and you can see how much closer the light is.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I said what could that be, and my friend started to scream and said there was a loud ringing in her head and she thought people were talking to her. My dog went crazy and ran off, and then I really started to get worried and cried. As this happened 2 more appered. The saucers started to get closer and that is when we could see them perfectly. They were a charcoal color and had bright lights all over them, mainly black lights. The crafts had strange writing all over them like writing from an ancient civilization.

Then many others followed-about 200 smaller ones of six to seven centemetre long. The looked lob sided. My friend wanted to get out, and the guy at the kiosk hid.

As I looked south, about 60 degrees off the horizon.  I noticed a triangle formation of stars that looked interesting because I was looking that the geometric features of the constilations.  I noticed that something was not quite right about these stars because they were moving.  The stars kept shape as they moved acrossed the sky from the South to the North, and the color was of that of a standard star.  The speed was constant, and no odd movements were made by the three stars.  As I watched; there were no similarities to the star that would point out if they were high flying aircraft.  No blinking indicator lights, or contrails coming the passing object or objects.  I also took note that if they were satelites, it is almost impossible to see them in the city, not to mention in a formation as well.  With growing up in an aviation family, and have seen many aircraft at and from many altitudes, this was quite odd.  As several minutes had passed, by the time the object had come to about 60 degrees off the horizon, the star like lights disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not much after I as seen the strange formation of moving stars, I was standing outside try to call some friends to see if they had seen what I had.  Now standing in the front yard, looking to the North.  I noticed that something very bright was now moving acrossed the sky.  It was moving from West to East and was about 20 degrees from the horizon.  It traveled to slow to be a jet, and did not make any noise.  The object was so bright that it illuminated a small low flying cloud as it passed through it.  No sudden movements were made as it traveled from West to East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No other aircraft were flying that I could tell as well at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We both observed extremely bright blue/white lights creating a formation a few times, then dissapearing, just to re-appear a minute or so later, moving slowly in different directions and at one time forming a horizontal disk looking object only shortly. These lights lasted for about 20 minutes or so. We kept looking in that direction and all over the sky but no longer saw anything after that span. It was very strange, and it couldn&#39;t have been anything on the mountain, it had to be hovering and couldn&#39;t have been a helicopter or plane due to the hovering and multiple extremely bright lights appearing and disapearing. Very strange and neither of us have ever seen anything like that before while standing on the smc roof parking structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had 3 whitish lights, one at each vertex. My 1997 Crown Vic is an ex-police cruiser with a spotlight controlled from the driver&#39;s seat. I shined the spotlight on the bottom of the triangle and saw &#34;USAF&#34; in Grey on Black on the underside of the triangle at each vertex. The &#34;USAF&#34; was dark grey on black just about at each vertex. After about 10 seconds I took off from the stop sign and the triangle just disappeared.

There were the usual satelitte sightings, a few meteors, and numerous airplanes.  Facing approximately due south, I noticed a satelitte about 45 degrees off the horizon, moving south-southeast. Another satellite traveling apparently in formation with the first appeared, and then a third appeared.  The three formed an elongated triangle and were very visible with the naked eye.  I did use my binoculars to track them however until they faded out one at a time, as most satelittes do.   At their brightest, they were about the same brightness as the stars of the Dipper - which is very visible overhead at this time of year. The shape of the triad did not change as they traversed the sky.   There were no blinking or strobing lights, and no sound. I am a private pilot and am familiar with aircraft.  The stars in between these points of light, we clearly visible; in other words, it was not a solid object. It is possible these were NOSS satelittes but I have not yet found corroborating info.  I might add that this is the 2nd time I have seen this apparent triad of satelittes in the night sky.   The last sighting was in Washington State a few years ago, from Mt.

I watched as one started to fade out, then reappeared on the far right moving up and down side to side.  Then another appeared just above the second and looked as if it split into two.  They would stay in one spot for around one minute and fade reappearing a second later on the far opposite side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked my wife to grab the video cam and digital cam.  I video taped several minutes of this and zoomed in with the digital cam and found they a C shaped in every picture taken.  In some pictures what looked to be lite colorful moons in the background and somthing silver in two other pictures.  In a couple of the pictures I included my boat to make sure the C shapes were not me moving the camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three Jets zipped thru the sky from Tampa in there direction and just before they got there the lites disappeared.

I went outside for a smoke, as I sat down I looked around the neighborhood to see what was going on. When I looked up to the into the sky I noticed a big star, that wasnt there before on other nights. As I looked at it it turned red and it was fadeing in and out, then it got very bright. At first I thought it was the a plane or helicopter. But then it I noticed it wasnt moving. So it wasnt a plane or helicopter. Then it faded out again. And I thought it was a satellite, and no I was wrong again. Then it was like a split second it was back again. Then it begain to move it went down slow but left a red streak behind it. Then It was back in the same place it started. Then went went side to side slow and again left a red streak. Then stoped and faded in and out a few more times. Then It was gone. I sat there for a few more minutes and waited for it again. And Nothing. I told my husband. He never told me that a week before that he saw it to. But this time it was in the back of our house, it was hovering like what I saw. He said it was big and red and was hovering above the trees. And it made no sound. It had turned from white to red and was fadeing in and out. By this time I had chills. What can this thing be, and what could it want. We are stuned and confused about it. Any help anyone has is much welcomed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects numbered in two at this point and kept in a linear formation. The colors of the objects were yellowish in color at this distance. At one point, the objects appeared to make a 60 degree angle to the eastern horizon. The objects were kept in view for about 10 minutes until one of the two observers picked up there car at a local church where it was parked. The other observer who was driving at the time of the first observation continued to his home. I then decided to drive in the direction of the lights and fueled up my car at the Sunoco at the corner of US 92 and Combee Road. After that I regained sight of the objects and turned onto Reynolds Road in order to keep the objects in view. At this point two more objects appeared to the south of the first two objects. These objects were close in angular separation. Upon reaching the stoplight at CR 540A, I noted several cars parked about 200 feet within the road that leads to Travis Vo-Tech center. Then turned east then turned into the PCC/USF campus in order to have a safe location to view the objects. It was noted that there was a red pickup truck located in the western most parking lot situated in such a way that the occupants may have been observing the objects in question. At this point the objects were about the brightness of Jupiter and had an orange-red color. The best color estimate would be that of the plume of an Atlas booster. I noted the car of a PCC employee that I know and decided to try to get him to witness the object. At this time he was on duty as the night security guard. I walked into the security office and told him what was being observed. He stepped out and observed the same lights in the east that I had. Five other employees also observed the lights. One I know personally and four others I do not know. The lights now were separated by approx 20 degrees of arc horizontal. The other two ! lights that were to the south now were not visible. The light then faded to invisibility. After the pair faded, another light approx. 10 degrees above the set that faded came into view. Once again lights to the south came on and were visible through the branches of nearby trees. The lights were observed through a pair of 7x35 binoculars. The light showed no structure. The lights faded again and the first pair came on again. After several minute, the lights faded and they were not observed from that point forward. At the time the wind was blowing roughly out of the east to southeast at a speed of about 5 to 10 mph. At first we though we maybe observing the burners from hot air balloons, but soon noted that the objects did not move over the period of the observations. Also the objects appeared as point sources, but they did exhibit some twinkling. We also did not observe structure. We made some other guesses as to what we were observing (flares dropped during military activity) but could not come up with an adequate explanation at that time. The Avon Park Bombing Range is about 30 miles to the southeast of Lakeland, the objects could have been military activity? I am an amateur astronomer with 22 years of observing time and have a BS. in Physics, the other observers had varied backgrounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Now I&#39;m scared !  I went back out tonight after talking with you took my bearings to the northwest skies from my home in ValCaron. I&#39;m writing in case something would happen. It came back as bright as ever in the northwestern sky again I thought its got to be a planet because that what it acts like but still moving faster than the earth&#39;s rotation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking through a set of binoculars I studied it for a while this time no colors just a bright light (white). This all started at 9:30 est. while watching which you couldn&#39;t see with the naked eye two pieces broke off the white object and moved one directly north over the horizon and 1 between north and the white object. With the naked eye they looked like distant stars. Looking through the binoculars they both changed colors like a twinkling star (red, blue, white). I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the scary part came along, just below the north object on the horizon a red light (I thought it was a tower light moved straight from the ground moving its way up to the north object in the sky. While the object moving from the ground 1/2 way up it changed from red to white, bright white, so bright that it lit the sky like a ray or beam of light straight up (like it came from one from a Mag flashlight. It did not meet with the north object, it made a B-line to the northwest light. By the way, while the red light was going up I screamed at my wife to come out and see this. She witnessed the red light going up and it turning into a white light. She then ran inside to get the video camera. We weren&#39;t ready for this and panicking at the same time. This took approx:.5 minutes to happen (red light to white light.). All I know that they all ended going directly south a great rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really hope someone else seen something happen to-night. I have a feeling that something is definitely happening. One sighting on Saturday and one on Tuesday. I&#39;m 50 years old and I haven&#39;t seen one that I couldn&#39;t explain. Its 12:19 a.m. and I&#39;m still shaking in my boots from this one. Still no noise, and yes the dog stuck real close to us. I could smell something in the air like flowers but they haven&#39;t started to grow here and the trees are just budding. One thing I forgot, at first I thought the red light going up was fireworks because that is what it looked like until it turned white and wasn&#39;t coming back down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I hope someone else seen this and I&#39;m glad my wife was here to witness the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com Redirect: http://www.brianvike.com Redirect: http://www.hbccuforesearch.com<n>

While reading a book I looked up at the clear sky sighting the moon. I then noticed a conical shaped object at an altitude of approximately 25,000 ft. It was stationary and the circumference had a constant solid glow- from the angle I was viewing it - it looked almost like the &#34;tick&#34; symbol  or &#34;nike&#34; logo. I watched it for several minutes unsure what it was then noticed that it shifting position where it leveled off to a horizontal position and could see that it was conical in shape and metalic coloured. I could clearly see a reflective metalic-like surface.  I asked several other guests if they could see the object which they could once I pointed out its direction. I then noticed a 747 pass behing the object which by my perspective made the object appear extremely large however I could not acurately scale it as I was unsure of the distance between the two object however the object was in the order of 20 times larger and I estimate between 5000 feet between it and the 747. By now all the pool guests were looking at the object and we watched it for atleast 10 minutes. I can tell you we were all transfixed and stunned. The object was so large and non-earth looking that we all seemed to be shocked into immobility and awe. We then noticed a warping or heat-wave like effect of the sky immediately behind the object and then it disappeared. We continued to scan the sky as we could not rationalise how the object had disappeared and were looking for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the USA for a conference and was totally coherent . I have never seen a ufo or had any real interest in such phenomena however I have a applied science degree and assure the reader this was not any optical phenomena.  This was not a balloon or plane , their were no discerning sound, no engines,no windows . Just a conical shaped obeject  with a solid band of light on its circumference and immnse in size .<n>

I looked outside and the ski was clear as day. All of a sudden there was a flash to the north. Two very fast moving objects were headed in my direction followed by another flash and two other objects of the same shape. Minutes later a diamond shaped craft much larger the others attacked the oval crafts. The smaller crafts flew around the diamond craft and began firing shocks of energy at the diamond shaped craft. A big explosion shook my grain bin and it fell apart. My wife and four kids woke up screaming and crying. In another flash the ufos were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

First of all it was a circle and it was orange it wasnt moving steadily it was kind of wobbling like a frisbe would if you threw it but It stayed in the air much longer than that and instead of coming down like a frisbee would it simply vanished into the clouds about 2 minutes later the second one appeared.

Suddenly between the trees that framed our view of sky what appeard to be three disks in a triangular formation passed above quickly above us.....can&#39;t really describe their size or altitude other than a guess but my initial impression of their size and appearance was of three softly glowing disks moving swiftly and silently in a triangular formation might have been similar in size to a large plane flying silently and swiftly 3000 or 4000 feet above us.  However the silence and swiftness and the three softly glowing disks in triangular formation bore no resemblance to any aircraft we had ever seen or heard of.

The lights was orange in the V formation, on left side 5-6 in the sraight line and 2 on the right side. The object flew quietly from West to Eatst and I felt it has big inercia. Its way visualy crossed the Venus. But the brightness of the Venus changed only slightly (I am not sure) I was very supprised. I attach a picture, which I found on the web and it is very close to that, what I saw. The visula size of the object was similar as on the attached picture with comparation with the Moon). Only the lights was orange without any blinking or changing of the intensity. Before the object dissappeared I saw it as from the back position (still V formation) but the lights I saw in the same intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

(although that time, there was 2 triangles, one was much larger and felt it was very low, hovering above the building in front of me) It was weird, I felt some sort of &#34;prescence&#34; that made me look up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The triangle was a deep-gray black, slightly different black than the rest of the night sky, and the stars (or lights) were all whitish hue, 2 the same size with one brighter at the tip. (for both triangles)   As we were still waiting for may grandmother to arrive I kept staring at it and it seems to float a bit to the side, but passed it off as my eyes playing tricks on me. (it was really light out at that hour, still blueish sky) I thought it was weird to see the lights when there was no stars out yet. My aunt escorted my grandma to the car, I pointed out the &#34;stars&#34; to them and my aunt looked stunned and uncomfortable, she even mentioned how she thought it was odd and that it seemed to be moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove away, and I kept watching from the back of the car.

I exited my front door and walked to the gardern gate using 7 steps. I walked to the sandwich shop and halfway there, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a fiery red flash up in the sky.  Shocked at this anomaly, I peered up and saw what looked like a globular material floating about 100 metres above the sky. 3 other people came out of their houses and looked at the unknown object, before it started to strecth itself, and turned into a face.  It started spinning and split into 6 pieces of seperate globular matter, spun once more and dissappeared.  We were very shocked, but when we decided to call the police, all of us, just couldn&#39;t do it, because we felt their was some inner voice in our head telling us to keep this secret.<n>
5/10/04 20:00|Delta (Canada)|BC|Triangle|5 mins|triangular shape (grey-black colour) with 3 stars of a whitish hue on each tip, one  star larger than the other 2. hovering, floating.|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37237.html|264|ndxe200405| Triangular sighting in Central Denver, 10 May 2004, at 3:35 AM<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just wondering about this and tossing in my two cents in case any other confused Denver area folks contact you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This morning, at about 3:35 AM, I had a pretty amazing sighting.  I went out in the back yard for a smoke and, as is my habit, I scanned the sky while puffing away.  I noticed a star moving, then another near it.  After checking to make sure it wasn&#39;t illusory movement, I noticed a third.  Basically, it was a triangular formation, two lights leading with the third trailing them.  The formation came in from the south-east.  As if that wasn&#39;t enough, as the trio passed directly overhead, a fourth &#34;appeared&#34;, joined the trio, and seemed to drop in altitude (perhaps because it definitely grew much larger and brighter than the other three).  The fourth came in from the east,  then changed course and speed to match the trio; the fourth partner sped off ahead of the trio to the north-east.

All lights in my house were turned off.  I saw what appeared to be a meteor shower in the northwest sky.  Something about the way the lights were travelling made me quickly realize it was not infact meteors.  I went out my front door and looked to the sky where the light were and watched as they moved positions, almost like how birds flying south do.  There appeared to be 7 of the objects moving at about the same speed but changing places.  The creepiest part of the whole experience was that they didn&#39;t seem too far off and they where completely silent.  I am involved with jet car racing and know that to attain a speed like what I witnessed would have to involve some sort of afterburning jet engine that would create and incredible amount of noise at that altitude and speed.  I an located just to the east of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in Sherwood Park and from where I was they appeared to fly from The Fort Saskatchewan area towards the Camrose area.  That is a fairly accurate discription of the sighting.  I hope this helps you, cause I know it helps me even just writing this summary of events (I was a bit creeped out about the sighting) Thank you<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports about apparently the same event.

Hard to tell exactly how large, could not make out any shape of the craft, just its lights, white in colour and spread out in a clylinder shape.  As it passed by me it appeared to be no more than 2 kms away at most.  If at 2kms it would have been at least 200 meters in lenght. I noticed them approaching quite far in the distance and looked like a single light until it approached closer to me It took only 25 seconds to pass by me from the first light I saw and then clear the horizion where it disapeared in the light reflection of the city.  No sound emmitted from the objects as they passed by, as I expected to hear something with the speed in which they were obviously traveling, guessing 1000 kms per hr plus at minimum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports about apparently the same event.

Just stayed inmobile for 15 mins. I came inside to report it and the stringed star was still on the same position. I have seen small star-like moving at a rapid pace, nothing like an airplane before but this is one is really weird! I just wish I had a digital camera so I could take a picture of it. I have taken pictures of the other moving objects that I have seen but with a regular camera and the pictures do not come out. Thank you for reading this report. Please advise if in fact this is a UFO sighting or something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were solid grey with no markings of any kind.  No lights or smoke trails. There was no sound even.  When the air show comes in the summer you can hear them flying but these had no sound at all.

The object was easily visible from near perfect sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking that the object was perhaps a cargo plane, I banked to the left lane and immediately ask my passenger if there was any air traffic in the vicinity other than the object. The reply was negative. As I completed the lane change, the unknown object suddenly appeared at my 1 o&#39;clock position (no more than a mile away) to change shape. And it was definitely not a cargo plane. The upper section, not concealed by any cloud, was gray, and on the lower section there appeared to be one or two reflective bright silver panels. The object was approximately 13 to 15 meters in diameter. Suddenly it accelerated and vanished from what I believe was a slow moving position. We gave chase but the object was gone.

Three lights in a horizontal row. Main light in center and to outer lights just slightly smaller. At first I thought it was a plane. We were sitting on the back patio of my friends house when I looked into the sky (have to go back to his house to figure out North, South, East, or West) and I saw these 3 lights. Like I said, at first I thought it was a plane. But as I watched I saw no blinking lights, and it apeared to be still. There was a, what I would expect to see in the movies, a radient blur of energy surrouning the objects. Don&#39;t know that it was energy, just light blur. I did not say anything to the other two guys who were talking for about 5 minutes when I was sure that it was not moving. I asked them what they thought it was. Of course they said a plane at first but I told them it was not moving. Then they said maybe it is coming at us so it is hard to determine if it is moving or not. I said I don&#39;t think so because at this point I had already been watching it for about 7 minutes. In that time, I saw at lease 3 planes fly within the same perimeter. It would surprise me to find out if i was the only sighting of this that night. I continued to watch for the next hour. I would go inside and about every 1.5 - 2 minutes I would go back and check. It never moved or changed position. I used an opening in some trees in the backyard as reference. Hard to say how far away they were but to guess I would say 5 miles. Finally after about an hour of watching this I returned to look and it was gone. I could not see it anywhere in the sky. Keep in mind my view was limited to a space in the backyard, however if these lights were just stars, I had enough of a view to be able to see them change position for a good few hours. Then my friend emailed me the mexican piolet sighting that happend in March I beleive. and the group of 3 lights is exactly what I saw, although there was only one group that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then we noticed the bottom was slightly illuminated against the background of the sky, but a lighter color than the sky.  The lights were steady, not blinking.  The object moved in a constant, slow direction across the sky similar to a satellite.  The front light was red, the back two white.  We watched until the object faded off into the distance.  The path it took was from left to right in our fields of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was large and in the shape of a ring.  It had an inner ring as well.  The ring was made up of large circles.  It had the resemblence to a cell under a microscope (ie membrane with a nucleus)  It had no distiguishable color  It was hovering a few thousand feet above myself and my friend.  It was slowly rotating.  It was not lit at all.  Though it was night it could be seen because it was illuminated by the moon.  At first it seemed like it could be a formation of parachutists however it would be odd for parachutists to be jumping at night.  The object spun slowly for a few minutes and then proceded to move east quickly.  It wasn&#39;t too fast though, it moved about as fast as a plane from a long distance away.  At one point while hovering an airplane passed by it however the airplane was much higher in alititude.  It passed behind the object and was ecclipsed by it for a moment.  The observers are college students.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Before I forget any of the details I would like to report what I saw. I live in the middle of the city in a highrise apartment building on the 17th floor. I was watching TV and then my husband told me there was sparks at the sky. So he got my attention and I looked out at the window and sure enough there was something peculiar.  At first there was only a few of these red lights or these red star like objects. There was a tall building blocking  a part of my panoramic view of the sky, so it looked like these objects are coming from behind that building.  And then it kept on coming, lots and lots of it...  I&#39;d say hundreds or more, lots of them! And they floated upwards toward the sky slowly, dispersing themselves as they move, distancing themselves from each other (from my point of view). There was no sound and we were just watching it in awe. Never seen anything like it. I&#39;m a UFO skeptic and also a backyard astronomer.  I&#39;d like to call this a natural phenomenon, but nothing fits the description.  What ever it is that I saw I highly doubt that its a meteor shower, because it doesn&#39;t come from a point in the sky. Rather it comes from just above the horizon and floated upwards, traveling from west to north of the night sky before it dissapeared slowly.  It wasn&#39;t a firework either, there was no noise at all.  I&#39;m pretty sure other people would see it, because it happened in the center of Bangkok.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assumed that the witness might have been looking at a fireworks display, or something along those lines, but if she has experience as an astronomer, she should have been able to rule out such a possibility at the time of the sighting.

While waiting, I looked to the northwest and noticed a satellite heading southward. I moved around in the yard quite a bit to keep the satellite, Cosmos Rocket 1943 or 1697, in my view and I watched it until I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the sky to the west. At 9:15pm, I saw a brief pulse of white light out of the corner of my eye which made me turn my head to the right slightly. About 60 degrees west, I saw the pinpoint of light pulse one time for approx. ½ second, then go out, then reappear 3 seconds later a tiny bit further to the northwest, stay lit for ½ second , then go out again. I watched this process for approx. one minute until I could no longer see it due to trees blocking the view. The object was heading northwestward. The color of the light did not change and was only visible when it would pulse. The duration of the pulses of light were always ½ a second long, but duration between pulses ranged anywhere from 2 to 7 seconds. The magnitude of the pulse was that of an average star, well below that of Venus, which was clearly visible to me in the western sky. I observed 2 aircraft heading eastward and was able to determine that the pulses of light were not like the aircraft in anyway. I checked Heavens Above.com and there were no satellites at this time heading northwest. The object covered ¼ of the sky in about one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object then glowed red for a second and seemed to grow larger before reverting back to the smaller white dot that it was.  It did this 3 times before going out of sight.  Odd thing was that this made no sound and was more than likely supersonic judging by the speed.  There is very rarely any air traffic in this area at this time of night.

I have been back in that same area 5 or 6 times since and have saw nothing until last night..Myself and three others were riding our quads behind the mountains in the hysampia river bottom (dry) We were riding and having a ball it was about 10:00PM.some of the guys had to work on Friday so we decided to head back to the trucks and load up..I had told the guys months back about the siteing we had and I got a real oh sure you did crap! We were headed west back toward the trucks as we drove over this little hill where we entered back into the wash. The lead guy Dennis stopped and waited on us. I thought this was funny cause most of the time they never stop for anything.(except beer) When the rest of us got to him he was waving his arms for us to stop to.We all stopped and saw two sets of lights just ahead of us over the wash above some corrals. It was flash back time for me..I told them to turn off their lights and motors.The lights were several thousand feet up I think. There they were again No noise, No nothing, motionless. These lights looked to be the same color as the ones we saw before. It was a full moon out and like daylight. I decided to drive closer with dennis behind me. we drove with the lights off real slow. the other guys waited not wanting to come..We had gone maybe a 1/4 mile when the lights went off. I believe I could see a faint outline of something that just looked black..Kind of in a wedge shape. I could&#39;nt tell if it was one thing or two? All of a sudden the lights came back on this time the ground was lite up under them. why is there no light showing down coming from whatever this is..? like a flash light would do?? We watched this for several minutes then heard the guys quads start up behind us.They were going out the other way and leaving us..Dennis said he didn&#39;t want to be another fir! e in the sky guy and said lets get the hell out of here. so we left and headed back around another way to the trucks.. we never saw the lights again.. This is the second time now for me seeing these lights. I have 5 guys who have saw the same things I have saw.No more sure you did now!! I wish someone one would go out there and camp that was braver than me. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON OUT WEST OF PHX???((name deleted))<n>

I pulled off of the side of the road to check my headlights on my car as I thought one of them had burned out.  It turned out that that was not the case, both were working properly. I just so happened to turn around and look into the eastern sky and saw what I thought was a planet or star shining real bright...then I realised that it was moving due west. All of a sudden, it stopped it&#39;s progress entirely. Then, from the north came another bright object and it pulled close to the other object and you could tell there was a space between the two objects. While both objects were stopped, a red beam came from the north object as if touching the other object for what I observed was for 5 minutes. Then the &#34;red beam&#34; retracted and the first object started a slow forward movement westward and then all of a sudden it shot out of sight at a tremendous speed and dissapeared and the second object turned and went in a northerly direction at a high rate of speed and vanished.

Its brightness was another thing that made me believe it wasnt a star.  I noticed that it was brighter than even the brightest of planets, however, it flickered red and blue.  It also emitted these red and blue lights away from the UFO, but these emitted lights were not as large and less intense.

However, while perusing webcams from Denver, Colorado on 5/6/04, I noticed odd lights in a webcam shot that seemed to be associated with two separate crafts, which were somehow lined up one behind the other.  The crafts appear to be disc-shaped.  They seem to be flying too close for airplanes.  This particular webcam shot is taken over the city of Denver, looking toward the west, but I do not have any more specifics.  It is from the TV station News 4 Colorado&#39;s webcam.  When I saw the odd lights, I saved the webcam snap.  At the time, I thought the lights were interesting enough, but since then, I find them even more compelling because now I think they strongly resemble the lights which were recently seen by so many in Mexico.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What happened was this :  We live in Goedehoop, Strand, RSA  Last night at about 17h25 I quickly had to go to the local shop to get something for my girl which she needed for school the next day. My youngest daughter (11) also came along. While I was busy pulling my car out of the garage, they were waiting on the driveway. As I was pulling the car out they started yelling excitedly and I quickly stopped and got out to see what is the matter. My oldest daughter (12) pointed up to the heavens and said &#34;Look, that star,  it is moving.&#34;   We stood watching it closely and yes it was moving. I off course then explained that it must be a radio/telecommunications satellite, but as we were watching it, it changed direction randomly ( something a satellite does not do - Below is a sketch of the path it followed ) . It then started to accelerate in speed and changed colour ( blue, red, green.  I can’t quite remember in which order - it all happened so fast ) and vanished into thin air. It originally came from Hangklip direction and vanished more or less above Helderberg. We must have been watching it for close on to a minute, maybe more ?

It kept changing it&#39;s shape as it more or less &#34;floated&#34; or &#34;tumbled&#34; down.  I estimate its size to be as big as Jeep.  I first noticed the object because it flashed in the sun-light and appeared to be a diamond shaped flash of light.  I pointed toward the object and my cousin said &#34;I see it too&#34;.  I stepped into the house and got my binoculars which are designed for astronomical use and was able to locate the object again and followed it with my binoculars.  It was a disc-like rounded shaped object with pewter/metallic on one side and as it rolled over and over, I could see that it was black with ridges on the other side and resembled the underside of a garden variety mushroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were astounded by this object.  It made no sound.  It continued to descend down toward the tree line until it disappeared behind it.  I assume it must have landed or &#34;something&#34; a mile or two from me although I haven&#39;t heard a word about it on the news.  I live near the airport and there were typical commercial aircraft flying high above this object.  It was not anything of this earth and certainly not man-made.

Wheile I was walking into the room I noticed a very bright white light in the sky.  I&#39;m not sure how high in the sky it was, but from looking out of my window it was above the tree lines straight ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed it right away since it was so bright.  It didn&#39;t move, so I thought at first it was a planet, but was not familiar with their locations in the sky, so I didn&#39;t know which ones were visible this time of year.  Anyway, I petted the cat for a bit while I watched it.  It was beautiful, and so bright that it &#34;shined&#34; like a diamond would.  I began looking around the rest of the sky, and I noticed an amber colored light far from the other light moving rather quickly heading in the direction of my house  I noticed no blinking lights on it.  Now here is where I get concerned.. About a month ago a friend and I were out driving and noticed an amber light in the sky moving quickly and not blinking.  We pulled over and watched it.  It then suddenly vanished..just turned off like a flashlight would.  It had us &#34;freaked out&#34;.  I had never seen anything unusual in the sky before, so after that I have noticed myself looking in the sky more lately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I then went to the back of my house to my back porch to see it pass over the house, and after it did, once again it vanished over the apartment complex behind my house.  Please bare in mind I cannot specify exact height or distances when something is in the sky moving.  I listened, and since I am close to a heavily traveled highway, I cannot tell if the sound I heard was a jet, or vehicles on the highway.  If it was a jet, it had to be military since it was moving much faster than a regular plane. However, I thought even military planes had to have some type of blinking light, or at least some type of light at all times, not just invisible in the night sky. Well, I went on with other things, and my husband came home around 11:00 p.m. and I still saw that bright light in the sky from my window.  About 10 minutes later we went upstairs to bed, and after I got ready I went into my son&#39;s room which too is upstairs and faces south (it is actually right above my family room) the light was gone!  I looked around, and I could see stars all over around where the light had been, so a cloud wasn&#39;t covering it.  I kept checking back for over an hour, and still no more light.  It too just vanished. It had remained in the same spot the entire time I had seen it, so it was&#39;t a low flying plane, and it was extremely bright!  Since I knew nothing about planets, and thought that&#39;s what it was at first, I know now that planets are really not that bright either.  Still, I can&#39;t find an explanation for it disappearing like that. I am hoping someone can set my mind at ease.  Two months and the same occurance, plus another disappearing act with a light on the same night. Are they connected to each other? Am I going crazy, or is there something else in the sky?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at Venus.  PD))<n>

The way the lights flashed were also odd, but not sure how to describe it and i don&#39;t think it matters.  The thing that caught my attention was that this craft seemed to be descending.  it wasn&#39;t moving left/right, or toward or away, but it seemed to be slowly falling to the earth.  eventually, some trees blocked my view and i lost sight.  The thing was pretty far away so theres a good chance it was a plane.  but if this thing did indeed descend to earth, then it would have landed on some busy roads where people would see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This is near the Stuart/ Jupiter Island area. They were in a stationary position slightly above horizan and directly ahead of us when I first observed them . Through my binoculars one light appeared larger and slightly lower than the other. No shape or supporting structure was visible. There were several cellphone towers in the vicinity. The lights appeared three times higher than the towers and remained fixed as we approached  and drove directly under them. At this point the larger light seemed to be one fourth the size of the moon with the other slightly smaller. They were very close together. There were no flashing lights. As we passed them I looked out the rear window and found nothing. I am most interested in finding a logical explanation for what we saw. As an experienced birdwatcher I frequently observe the skies and feel confident I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found here to be exceptionally objective and credible.

The object had a lot of lights on the bottom side of it and was elongated, somewhat cigar shaped, but seemed to have two round parts on the front and rear.  The object went from being dead ahead at perhaps a 40 degree angle up and zipped beyond the horizon in a matter of seconds.  It almost appeared to have streaks it was going so fast.  There was no noise generated by this object.  I have never seen anything like this that I could not identify.  I have not wanted to see something like this.

The fireball was distinct glowing red yellow and blue with a red tail that appeared to be about 3 feet long.

This was right over the river as we stood by the River Palm hotel, a very public type area. The Lights from the Hotel went straight up into the sky and the object went straight over head. We even thought at first perhaps it had been a flock of geese but could not have been as we heard no noise of any kind. Every time we go back to Laughlin we go the River Palm Hotel same spot and same time Dusk and look up. This has helped as we realized it was much much bigger than anything like geese because it was about the same height in the sky as the helicopters that were flying earlier. Also we noted that each round or balloon shape was nearly the size of one copter or a small VW volkswagon beetle bug or nearly as big. They looked like they were stringed together, I say that because they weren&#39;t exact as they were in a V shape and as I said about 8 on each side. It seemed to me that one side seemed to move or some on one side seemed to move. My husband the other witness didn&#39;t notice that. As we stared nearly straight up the colors seem to be almost opal or of many reflecting colors as if it were reflecting the colors which would make sense since the lights were so bright from the hotel. We could see it disappear into the clouds, gradually disappearing, also it seem to be going some what slow. Naturally no one else was around towards the other end towards other end of river nearer the Flamingo Hotel there are more people. Naturally at that time I didn&#39;t have a cell phone with camera nor a digital camera. It was just to 2 of us. I keep better records but had the info lost in my old email enfo so I am not exact on the month as a matter of fact it was somewhere between  months and 26 months ago. We could ck our records perhaps our credit card to find when we stayed at the River Palm. I have asked and even notified the airport tower of course I waited a year to do so but they said they saw nothing. I can&#39;t believe no one else saw this because it was so hudge. To small to be geese, dismissed the idea of weather balloons because of direction and way it move. It was formed line a bomerange of round alluminating light like colors. Not having lights but reflecting light. I would say it was dusk between 6pm and 7:30 pm somewhere between April 2004 and June 2004  or Sept. 2004 and Oct. 2004 ( possibly even 4/2005-6/2005 but I believe it was longer ago than that)WE avoid the place when it gets really hot or really cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We (me and my husband) were looking at a plane flying by, when I saw a little white dot way up in the sky. It seemed to be stationary, and it was too high to be a bird, or plane, or cloud. It was very tiny, just a little white dot. About the size of this period . to my eyes. It was visible for about 10-15 minutes, and all the while I was trying to point it out to my husband. However, it was hard to see unless you happened upon it, like I did. I looked away a few times, and was able to find it again. After awhile, I looked away, and then tried to find it again and couldn&#39;t find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The Jet just went over the brow of the nearest mountain.  There was zero noise.  We thought it was an asteroid - size of a crater, shaped more like a rocket, with a long Comet-like tail.  The rocket like objects had a red/dark orange-like round tail end, and the end was dragging like a firework coming down from the sky.  Initially I did think the shape coming so fast from the sky was more like a saucer before it turned like a rocket as it shot lower and lower in these 4 seconds.  The brain just tells you it must have been a fighter Jet or Asteroid - I did not recognise this type of VISION.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We  had  left Ladner on Hwy 17 North and were on the southbound exit to Hwy 99, when I first noticed the large bright multi-colored lights (blue, purple, white, orange and green) to the northeast over Surrey.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, but as we neared the Boundary Bay Airport the craft passed over our car and despite the fact that we were going 100 km/h seemed to hover keeping pace with us.  I looked out the passenger window and saw the expansive square-shaped dark grey underside (no identifying markings) with 4 sets of 3 equally  spaced  (about 30+/-10 ft apart) oval lights lined up end-to-end emanating from the center to each corner.  It was no more than 1000 feet off the ground and large enough to block the rain. There were no seams, hatches, flaps, or tail rudders visible, no discernable means of propulsion , and no sound. It continued southwest, and when I last saw the craft it was following Hwy 17 South  in a slow and unhurried manner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting left me shaken and dumbfounded .

As I threw their newspaper, which I am a carrier, I noticed the full moon right in front of me, up at about a 60 degree angle. A band of light wispy clouds were around it and to the left was a small patch of cumulus clouds there were being highly reflective from the moonlight. Below this was totally clear sky, a medium to bright blue since it was a full moon. I had just put the car in reverse to back out of there and this bright orange sphere flew from left to right in front of me and then disappeared within 3 seconds. It flew parallel to the ground in an absolute straight line and looked to be within tree top height since I could see the treeline behind it. I estimated it to be within 50ft off the ground and looked to be small in diameter. At that time, I was on the phone with another carrier who was approx a 100 miles from me and I made an exclamation of what the &#34;F&#34; was that, and he said, &#34;I don&#39;t know but I just saw a shooting star.&#34; I told him that I saw the same thing, only low to the ground and straight as an arrow, no arc or variance from that straight line. He expressed the same thing that it was only maybe 30-35 ft off the ground. He said he saw a round orange fireball looking thing and that it was small. The sighting was totally instantaneous but yet we were approx 100 miles apart with him being in Clinton County at the time. I don&#39;t know what we saw, I only know that we saw it at the same exact time and it scared both of us to know end. We&#39;re both out throwing papers way out into the country where houses are miles apart, so there&#39;s no major city lighting to interfere with this. I was at a house when I saw it but he has only 1 pole light in the yard that was to my left. I presume that this was some kind of fireball, maybe 5 inches or so in diameter, very small, but yet below treetop height.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What I saw was what was referred to on the television show as &#34;A String Of Pearls.  Against the night sky, they where oval and appeared against the sky as small oval clouds, only these where obviously not clouds.  They were much too small and they moved like nothing I have ever seen.  From Ft. Collins, Co., they seemed to appear over Denver, Co., south of Ft. Collins and just east of Denver and the Government&#39;s satellite/missle tracking center (I forget it&#39;s name)in a granite mountain in the Rockies that is designed to withstand a nuclear bomb.  In a 2-3 min. period, they came out of the clouds, sometimes one would seem to link up to another, but they moved around, sometimes one would stop and then move again.  They moved pretty quick considering their height.  3-5 of them moved around for a few min. (the no. depended upon the cloud cover, some dashing in and out) before all but one disappeared back above the cloud cover.  Only one was left, but after three min., all of a sudden, it moved from a stand still and then went into (terms learned from T.V.)warp drive and dashed off into space, disappearing into space that was not covered by clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a dull tiel color that almost seemed translucent.  I saw it with my nieghbor and we followed it on foot for mabey 45 seconds to a min. before it disappeared behind some trees.  We then decided to look for the craft by car.  We must have driven around the area we saw it in for about half an hour, but we never saw it again.  I can definalty say that the craft moved in jerking movments side to side and up and down while heading in an eastern direction.  It didnt seem to move until we started to pursue it on foot and thats when it started moving away from us.  The craft seemed to be lingering close to the power lines in the ally of our nieghborhood.

There are two ways to go home, the short way and the long way.  The long way is only about three minutes longer, but 99 percent of the time, we take the short way.  My wife was driving and for some reason when we came to the point where we could chose between the short and long way, I told her, &#34;take a left, let&#39;s go the back(long) way home.&#34;  Right before we took that left turn, I noticed a small single-engine plane flying S/SE at around 500 to 700 feet.  I could easily see its red and green lights.  Bessemer Municipal Airport is about six miles NW of this location.  This airplane looked like it may have departed from Bessemer due to its altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued to drive the long way home and I thought to myself, &#34;why did I tell her to go this way?&#34; and &#34;I hope she didn&#39;t mind me telling her to go this way.&#34;  We turned right at Highway 58, going west in Helena when I clearly noticed this big object in the sky with three white lights, the center light being the brightest of the three.  I could see the grayish outline of a boomerang shape, with the bright light in the center and the left and right white lights on the edges of the &#34;wings&#34; of the object.  For some reason I nonchalantly pointed to it and said, &#34;see, things like that.&#34;  I don&#39;t know why I said that.  We had not been talking about seeing strange things.  It was like the whole reason why we went the long way home was to see this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she saw what I was seeing, she stopped the car and asked, &#34;what is that?&#34; and &#34;it&#39;s not moving.&#34;  It wasn&#39;t moving.  It looked like it was stationary in the sky.  The object was about 35 degrees, NW of our location at a range of about 1 mile and an altitude of anywhere from 1000 to 5000 feet depending on the size of this thing.  It was &#34;pointed&#34; in the direction of SE and none of the lights were blinking.  The pure-white aspects of the lights on this thing really stand out in my memory of seeing it.  The center light was as bright as Venus is currently in the evening, and I recall seeing this object and Venus at the same time, with Venus to the left and higher up in the sky, maybe five degrees away.  At an arm&#39;s length, the boomerang-shaped object was about 1-1/2 inches wide and 1/4 inch tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A car was coming up behind us so we had to start moving down the road.  As we did, I kept my eye fixed on the object.  Intermittently, trees would pass and block the view that I had of the object, but it was still there.  We came to Highway 17 and instead of turning left to go home, my wife turned right to get a better view of this object.  My view was blocked by a gas station and the bright flourescent lights of the outside of the gas station.  When my view was clear again, the object was gone.  We continued to drive north on this road.  Oddly enough, there was a vehicle off the road and in the ditch on the side of the road with its headlights on, but we didn&#39;t see anyone in it.  This distracted us briefly, but it didn&#39;t seem to be a serious accident.  We continued to drive and we saw what appeared to be the object again, but now it was way to the north, about 5-7 miles away, much higher in the sky and what appeared to be headed to the north.  It was now moving away from us quickly and we soon lost sight of it over the northern horizon(toward Birmingham).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We drove through a subdivision on our way back home, driving slowly to see if we could notice the object once more, but we never saw it again.  We circled around by the forementioned gas station and saw where a police cruiser was arriving on the scene where the vehicle was in the ditch.  We made it home about 90 seconds later where we discussed what we just saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These questions remain:  What did we see?  How did it move so far away, changing directions and altitude so quickly?  What made us go home that way?  Why did I say what I said when I saw the object?  Did the driver of the vehicle in the ditch see this thing, thus distracting the driver to cause the accident?  I guess we will never know that.  Maybe I am over-thinking this whole thing, but my wife and I know that we saw a large boomerang thing with three lights floating stationary over Helena, AL for at least 10 seconds that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather at the time: skies were clear, the air temperature was in the 50&#39;s(F) and there was a light northerly breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object did not follow the rotation of the stars. When he hit Albuquerque, the object was moving in a North West direction.

I was checking the WAPT TV weather cam and saw this UFO! I had saved the two pics but unfortunately you can&#39;t do that with a webcam shot without it automatically refreshing itself. :o(  At least not this webcam. I have already contacted the station to see if they have the still shots by any chance. At any rate, at 12:15 P.M., central/standard time there was a silver disk over Jackson, MS, just to the left of the Standard Life Building (the tallest building in the pic) and about midway up. I&#39;m just really disappointed about this!!! In both of the pics, however, the second one was a refreshed shot with the time labeled at 12:21 P.M., so just minutes later...and in the second pic at 12:21 it was GONE! It is a gorgeous, sunny, clear day and not a cloud in the sky today and no rain whatsoever!!! So this can&#39;t be due or rain, etc.!<n>
5/3/04 21:26|Helena|AL|Chevron|20 seconds|Two adults witness boomerang-shaped object during a strange sequence of events|5/10/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36729.html|363|ndxe200405| Oval object with a rotating tethered object in the middle, observerd Oval blow up<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is for the record on May 3rd 2004 at approx. 5:57 AM daylight savings time in Hayward Ca. looking south almost straight up I saw a bright light, it appeared like Venus so I pointed my telescope at the light using the low power finder and I then looked in the main telescope eyepiece and ... it was nothing I had ever seen in the past 5 years of observing or ever in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was oval in shape (grayish almost transparent) with 2 dots evenly spaced half way from the outer edge of the oval (1 on either side of the oval) think of a lady bug, then at the center of the oval there was a tethered object rotating around the oval in perfect symmetry (between the 2 dots). It looked like a string with an object connected at the end and it was rotating around the center the oval in the direction it was traveling. Almost as if it was the propelling force that caused the oval to move. Think of pedaling a bicycle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it for about 10 seconds and looked back up in the sky and it was bright. Now being sure I could find it again I ran inside to get a witness. It was almost 6 AM and I pulled my sleeping son out of bed and aligned the object again in the telescope and his comment was &#34;what is that?&#34; I&#39;ve shown him may astronomy objects such as nebulas, star clusters, and most of the big planets so this was also new to his eyes also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now 2 minutes at the most passed as I tried to get a camera up and running but no luck and the object was moving overhead so I looked again through the telescope and just at that point ... the oval blew up. The explosion looked like a firework that just went off in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was observed next was unexpected ... the tethered object in the middle separated intact and continued to rotate. So what I saw was an explosion the tethered object separate and the rotation continued (only now end over end instead of rotating around the oval). And now instead of moving overhead the tethered object is starting to move downward. (My hand tracking of the telescope now has me moving the telescope down instead of &gt; up and over as with the original path the oval was moving which was south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The tethered object now had 2 distinct ends one was the pivot end and the other was the original object that was rotating around the oval. So the rotation stayed the same but now moving downward as if falling from the sky and rotating around a new pivot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The new pivot point is now interesting as it now takes shape and color. It appears like an elongated cone, orange in color and it appears as if there are 2 &#34;strings&#34; coming from the &#34;cone&#34; to the tethered object rotating around this &#34;orange cone.&#34; The &#34;strings&#34; seem to come together as one, half way down the length of the tether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this for about 1 to 2 minutes and even tried a higher power eyepiece but due to the narrow field of view of the higher power eyepiece I only saw it briefly and subsequently lost track of the tethered object. The orange color was more evident at the higher power and the 2 &#34;strings&#34; appeared more evident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The telescope used was a Meade 8&#34; Newtonian on an equatorial mount,ironically the mirror was just cleaned the day before so it was perfect and the only reason I was still out at 6 AM (the Sun was rising and ruining the star gazing) was the tracking motor was malfunctioning and I wanted to test the tracking on any bright object I could find before total Sun rise washed out even the brightest of stars and I would have to wait till night fall to test again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather condition was clear with good transparency (no haze)and the temperature was in the high 50 degrees F.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then after the plane was gone we noticed a flashing light that appeard to be moving back and forth. Of course nothing was thought of it until it stayed in the same spot. There were colors that were flashing from it. They were in a pattern of red, blue, then yellow or white. Again this object kept moving side to side. I ran and got my cam corder and was able to capture this on film. It started becoming smaller and withen minutes was just gone. I am not saying that I witnessed a UFO but I know it was no aircraft that our goverment lets us know they have the technology for. If any one can help us clarify this it would be greatly appreciated. Also, during the time I was recording this, my husband was taking pictures with our digital camera at the sky; just to see if any thing would show up. These pictures are remarkable and they, as well, are not of any pictures I have ever seen. Thank you for tacking the time to read this. I hope youcan help us understand.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Though it was near the airport, it was too far North to be a tower, etc. As I approached the intersection, I began to realize that this was absolutely an aircraft of some kind, hovering at appx. 100 feet. Being an Air Force veteran, I instinctively turned down my radio, rolled down my window, and put my ear to the wind in order to detect (or not) audibly the sort of power plant that could be lifting this immense craft. There was nothing but the sound of my slowing engine, as I eventually found myself completely bewildered, and at a dead stop ion the highway, head craning out the window. There were three distinct points, each with its own circular, whitish light; no windows, etc. My first thought was something like, &#34;Whatever the hell this is, why would it choose to hover idly right here. Then, I slowly turned back East onto White&#39;s road in order to observe it more closely. As I gazed up at the craft, innumerrable possibilities flashed in and out of my mind, each being dismissed as an impossibility for any number of (known) scientific and avionic detractions, and as this went on, I started to become a bit anxious (again w/regard to any fathomable agenda the craft&#39;s occupants/operators could possibly have), and so I let out the clutch and began rolling forward. As I did, to my utter astonishment, it began moving in the same direction, at the same rate of travel, as I. Anxious to somehow verify what I was seeing, I realized that not one other vehicle was even in sight for about the last three minutes- unusual at the time. Anyway, desiring to hasten fate, I hit the gas and noted that the craft was keeping perfect distance and rate of acceleration to me.  Confused, and somewhat frustrated with my inability to conventionally rationalize, or at least share the experience with even another motorist, I began yelling and giving the SUV everything it had. Almost as if it (they?) had sensed my increasingly negative emotional state, it suddenly broke pace w/ me (@maybe 70 MPH), and began to arc upward and to the West, as its speed increased at an eye-popping rate, and then it went lights out. I hammered the brake, skidding to a stop just in time for the first oncoming vehicle to see nothing more than a cloud of dust around my truck. This was one, though not the first of 4 or 5 events of similar magnitude and inexplicability. Another time, on another well traveled dirt road further East in the valley, I viewed a seemingly identical craft hovering over a house at appx. 40 feet. I left before it did.<n>

We went into my back garden to start the Anual Research of Space Exploration meeting. As i was looking through my telescope i happened across a queer object in the region of Orions belt. I called Vic and Bob over to look over at this object they reckoned it was just Shooting Stars. But i knew it was something else something queer, something wrong. I saw the object enter our atmosphere, i knew then that this was wrong. The object was spherical in shape, i saw it as clear as day the object then split into two craft and one went west and went east, and we never saw the craft again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It slowly made a smooth turn to the left and passed over.  There were four of us in the car and we were all watching.  As it passed over head and just in front of us we saw 3 white lights and one flashing light that made up this perfect triangle shape.  There was no noise and the craft glided across the sky.  The strange thing about it was you couldn’t see the body of the craft like when an airplane flies by; it was as if you could see through it.  It flew off and accelerated towards the north, north east.  I’m a pilot myself and can identify almost any civilian and military aircraft by shape and by sound.  I also know what kind of lights are required to be on an aircraft and where they are located.  So it takes something very out of the ordinary to get me to say hey look, that’s not normal and this did just that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information.

We first thaught they were pollen as they were jusst floating slowly in the sky but they were way too far away for that. I cam corded the event and as the lights floated cloaser together five of them formed a V shape, and then several others caught up and joined in this strange formation. As they disappeared behind the Excalibur hotel on this clear night a helicopter flew by as if to be cureous, then strangely headed in the opposite direction and flew behind the Flamingo hotel. We waited to see if the lights would re-appear on the other side of the hotel, but nothing else was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We routinely receive reports from Las Vegas, and we believe that most of the reports are of light-colored birds, which pursue the insects drawn to the bright lights above the hotels and casinos.

I just got there and hadnt had a drink yet. I didnt know anyone else back there so i just smoked &amp; looked up at the sky. Directly under the moon i spotted an object flying in my direction. The sky was completely clear and i thought it was a plane so i watched. As it came closer i noticed it was dark orange and sphere shaped. I figured that it was a light from the plane. It was at a distance &amp; i had no reason to suspect otherwise. Then all of a sudden the sphere shape stretched out from the right side into a shape i can best describe as an oval. At this point i thought to myself, &#34;O.k, it&#39;s an orange kite or something.&#34; Just as fast as i uttered that phrase in my mind, it returned to sphere shape. As it flew closer i realized that this thing was going much faster than a plane or anything i could concieve it to be. As it was coming closer &amp; passing over me, i could clearly see a metallic shape circling around the sphere at an extremely fast pace, much faster than the sphere itself was moving. I couldnt tell the shape of it, but due to the clear sky &amp; the bright moon, it stood out. The metallic object seemed to be circling the direct center of the sphere. This thing was going so fast i couldnt believe what i was watching. I tapped the guy next to me and said &#34;hey, what the #@&amp;%! is that?&#34; By the time we both looked up this thing was pretty far already. He replied that it could be a satellite (he hadnt been watching it before hand like myself) but as we watched it, it stopped going in a straight direction and raised in altitude on an upward slant as if headed toward space. The object seemed to disapear. I looked around hoping someone else had been looking up, but the 8 or so people there were engaged in conversations with eachother. The guy who i pointed it out to did not seemed phased &amp; just walked back in the bar. I dialed the operator on my cell phone ( i didnt know what else to do) &amp; asked if anyone else called in a sighting of an ! unidentified object over east Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He laughed,so i hung up. Orange sphere flying at an extremely fast speed, metallic object circling around it at an even faster pace. This, i will never forget. Ive never experienced any thing like this, i know what i saw because it was a perfectly clear night, and i will continue from here on forth to search the internet for another reporting of this sighting. If only to get rid of the &#34;how silly am i&#34; feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sighting occurred as it was getting dark in a wooded, acreage-residential area on Bridges rd.   The property was a couple of acres of clearing surrounded by stand of trees approx 30 ft tall.   The sighting and later occurrences still to this day bother me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Stepping out of the residence, facing what I believe to have been due North, a really distinct silence fell over the area.  No insects, dogs or any sound (very unusual many dogs and insects), the silence actually felt strange and was largely indescribable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped and began looking around, right above the treeline to our right (East),  probably within 100ft, was a black triangle with lights (not beams just small lights).  It was moving very slow, just barely clearing the tree tops.  So slow actually, that it should have fallen right out of the sky, it made absolutely no sound, there was absolutely no sound, period!  It was dark in color and had various lights, almost airplane like, except none flashing.  I cannot recall the exact color of lights that were present but they were multicolored, perhaps red, white and orange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I excitedly exclaimed to my friend to LOOK!  He exclaimed various swear words and amazement.  As I glanced at him I noticed that he was not looking in the same direction, as I followed  his gaze I realised that there was another craft dead ahead, slightly further away.  Both were headed North excessively slowly with no variation in course and appeared to maintain continuous distance apart.  We watched them until they were out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t remember if all of the local dogs were barking before the silence, but after the craft were out of sight and the silence was gone, it was as if someone turned the mute button off and all the local dogs went nuts.  The insects of course were making noise everywhere also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right as we began debating whether this could have been  military aircraft, the roaring roters of multiple helicopters (not sure how many, at least 2 or 3) came in low, just screaming, headed dead on in the direction of the craft.  It was incredibly loud and certainly everyone around heard it.  If all speeds and directions of the parties were maintained they would have caught up quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have spent time in Guam, Hawaii and Pensacola where there is a very large navy aircraft presence.  I have even seen a Stealth Bomber in broad daylight before they were generally allowed to be viewed (when Korea was lobbing missles in Japan&#39;s vacinity).  I have been around constant helicopter and hornet fighter traffic, I currently live in predator drone testing grounds and have been seeing those for years, saw one land recently (they make noise).  I have never seen anything like what we saw, especially the silence, every fiber of your being tells you something is wrong when the world shuts off like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen helicopters pushed as hard as that day either, I was afraid for the pilots.  Furthermore, I have common sense and understand general physics... at least as we know them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of side notes.  I developed a nodule on my thyroid soon after the experience and I believe it to be related.  I would not approach or watch these things too long.  Furthermore, there were creepy occurences at the residence there for sometime after and maybe even still.

The man and his wife had some family members over to their home. The witness had been telling his sisters boyfriend about what they saw on April 24, 2004. The witnesses sisters boyfriend looked out the window and commented, &#34;it wouldn&#39;t be the light on the tower over there?&#34;  The witness said, what tower !  The witness looked out the window and there again was something flying around the sky. There is no tower in the area where the sisters boyfriend was pointing out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time the witness grabbed his video camera and started to take some footage. Now he admits that he is a ammeter photographer and just doing his best to get a shot of what they were observing in the sky. With the excitement of seeing something strange he admits there is shake when viewing the footage, but all of the family members who watched the film says it is very interesting to watch and the fellow still gets the shot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no multiple lights seen this time, only one object that shoots off at a fast rate of speed across the sky. The man who is filming this object, puts the camera down for a brief second as he was discussing what he was seeing with his sisters boyfriend. When he looked up again, the light/object was back where it originally was, or when the witness first saw it. Like the man said, it seemed impossible for something to move so quickly across the sky and return to the  spot from where it came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When viewing the tape back at a slow speed the fellow says you can almost see the outline of the thing, the classic saucer shaped craft. Also still viewing the tape on the slow speed they tell me you can see a burst of  color, purple pinkish.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We will see what the investigator who will be visiting the witnesses comes up with.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I would like to add. It was quick thinking that the witness thought to grab his video camera. I would suggest that folks keep a camera of some sort with them, or close by.

We live in Bremerton Washington. At about 7:24 PM Pacific Standard time, we observed a bright white flash on the moon in the upper/mid Mare Serenitatis region, west of Crater Posidonus. Perceived as larger than how Venus appears. It was a quick flash  like white, intense lightning. I&#39;m not sure how to report degrees of arc but if the face we see is 90, and we start from the east then the flash occurred about 225 arc seconds to the west. This was observed by the naked eye, with clear skies between us and the moon.<n>

I was going 55mph. I quickly said what the heck is that to my girlfriend siting beside me, she gasped with shock as I. slowing down I passed more trees and out of view of the red light, I quickly pulled back to find the red light was no longer there. Sitting for about 20 seconds I said I was going to find it so I took the next left to see if I could see if it turned and about 5 seconds after taking the left my girlfriend said &#34;there it is&#34; and I look out to the horizon line and I see the red light floating over the mountains, I started driving towards it and my girlfriend started getting frantinc saying &#34;get out of here its right there&#34; and made me turn around and leave saying &#34;faster faster, they are rite there&#34;. She was so shocked, I was definately adrenalin rushed chasing it down. When I first saw it big it looked like it was maybe 300 feet away but about 25 seconds later took the left turn and it was probaubly 10 miles away over the mountains. I asked why my girlfriend was so frantic at me getting away so quick and she said it was over our car and she never saw it on the horizon line as I never saw it by our car...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

This happened like over a year ago and I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t write anything about it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We just got back from a pizza place and I had read books about ufo&#39;s so I always looked up at the night sky. First I saw three blinking lights and the first one would go on and then go off and then the second and third one would do the same. Then there was 3 or 4 of them all doing the same thing. And they were all togther and airplanes I don&#39;t think can do that because they could crash and airplanes have like red and green lights. I&#39;ve been like freaked out ever since then about abduction and stuff like that because that&#39;s when I really got into researching and stuff. And my friend told me about how a few years ago she had seen an ufo and it was really big and she said she saw little black things in the window. I can have her fial a report but you probably don&#39;t want a bunch of reports from teens and stuff. But we see alot of things too, things that like adults would just say is a new kind of air plane and things like that. I feel better about telling an adult what I saw. Thanks.

It went over the train trestle north to south as I went under it. I was thinking what would a small airplane be doing flying at that time and it was so dark and cloudy you couldn&#39;t even see the stars. I was so awed by what I saw, and still couldn&#39;t believe it.  I thought I would wait to see if anyone else reported anything like what I saw.

No sound or lights!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was assigned to the local high school, as a Deputy Sheriff, to provide security for the school against student vandalism. While sitting in my patrol car I was using our night-vision monocular, which was issued to me for this assignment, to observe the sky as it was a clear morning. A few minutes later something dark in the sky caught my attention through the lens. This object was not visible to the naked eye, however, the night-vison unit accentuates any available light and this in-turn illuminated the stars brightly. The object was visible to me only because it blocked out the stars in the sky&#39;s background thus it was clearly and sharply defined although black in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving from West to East with absolutely no sound. My environment at the school parking lot was totally quiet with only an occasional passing car on Highway 129N which is located approximately 1,000 ft. from my location. The object had no lights and did not illuminate whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s shape was something akin to a cross with two differences: 1. Picture a cross with the horizontal portion moved forward near the top but not quite. 2. There was another horizontal portion visible towards the rear. That portion was not as wide as the forward horizontal postion. Also, all portions, especially the horizontals, were about 25% broader than what you would expect on a standard (?) cross.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously the size/altitude could not be determined, nor the speed. However, the night-vison I was using does not magnify and I would estimate that the apparent size from my view, if you took a coin in an outstretched hand, appeared about the size of a quarter-dollar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My viewing time was around a couple of minutes. I lost sight of the object due to the awkward angle of trying to crane my neck from right to left as it moved across the sky. I exited my vehicle to further look for it, however I could not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As a retired professional pilot of 20 years . . .I have seen many things I could not immediately explain, however, none of them remained a mystery for more than a few minutes.  This object is absolutely un-explainable to me and I have had two years to ponder it. I DO NOT believe in extraterrestrial craft at this point and I am certainly a dyed-in-the-wool skeptic on such matters. I cannot conceive of a rational explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
