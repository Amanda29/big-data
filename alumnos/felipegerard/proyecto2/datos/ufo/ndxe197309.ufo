A|11/1/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04531.html|1|ndxe197309| Driving on a back road in rural Wayne county, we had been driving along a stretch of woodland when we entered some cleared farmland.  As we passed this area, a harvested hay field; we saw 5 or 6 small craft sitting in the field at the back of the clearing near the woods.  They were approximatly 500 or 600 feet from the road.  About the size of a volkswagon bug with a red light at each corner of a triangle.  As we passed thru the area they each rose from the field and flew over the field and the road behind us.  I saw nothing else as I was busy getting the hell out of there.  My friend and I told no-one at the time even though there had been articles in &#34;The Daily Record&#34;, the local paper; discribing a much larger triagular craft being seen around the county.  I&#39;ve always wondered if the several smaller craft assembled into the larger one.  Wayne county had several sightings of a large trianglar craft again in 1975.  Many saw it, myself included.  Many years later I read the book about the Hudson Valley sightings and it was identical to the craft I and another friend saw in 1975.  The local paper covered both sightings very well, giving them front page exposure.<n>
9/28/73|Strongsville|OH|Other|10 minutes?|A gray metal bell shaped object, half as tall as it was wide, no windows, no sound, hovered 25' in the air.|4/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35760.html|2|ndxe197309| A gray metal bell shaped object, half as tall as it was wide, no windows, no sound, hovered 25&#39; in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard on the radio one evening, that you wanted these, no matter how long ago they occurred. My reporting this incident to family and friends when it happened, was met with ridicule. Have been silent ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday, Sept 28, 1973, came off the Ohio Turnpike exit at route 42 in Strongsville, Ohio. Noted looking south in traversing the long circular exit ramp, that there was an aircraft descending. Thought that very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a trained US Customs Officer, familiar with all types of aircraft and helicopters....this one mystified me....and what was it doing in this place?...then a semi rural suburban area of Cleveland. As I got to the bottom of the ramp, saw though my driver&#39;s side window that the object was about 500 feet in the air, and had a circular bottom. Turned right onto route 42, Pearl Rd. The object passed overhead. It was then about 100 feet up. No sound emitted from it. I was behind it, moving about 35mph and it was still descending and moving not much faster than my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then at the intersection of Webster rd. and Pearl rd., it stopped and hovered over the intersection, in front of me. I came up to the crossroad and stopped for the red signal. The object was in front of me and hung in the air about 25 feet up. I estimated the diameter of its base at 30 feet and it was bell shaped, about 15 feet tall...the top of it like a dome. It&#39;s color was like gray gunmetal. It had no visible apertures or openings on it, nor any identification symbols. It rather scared me that this thing was stopped in front of me. My radio was crackling badly and unintelligible. Two cars had come up behind me and both had pulled to the side of the road. I pulled over too as I did not to go under it. I pulled over, got out of the passenger side of my car and looked up....<n> <n><n> <n><n> but THE OBJECT WAS GONE-VANISHED!!!! WAS Dumbfounded. The two cars that had been behind me were also gone. Thought I must have hallucinated. Felt nauseated and sick. Got back in my car and drove another 10 minutes or so home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family was put out with me that I had missed dinner and was an hour late. Was shocked at that. Went out to my car and looked at the clock which read 5 minutes after seven. My usual trip home from Akron, normally an hour&#39;s drive, had taken 2 hours. I could never explain where that hour went. There were subsequent events in my life that proved strange and not explicable, but my purpose here is just to report what I saw, and let it go at that. Would be grateful if could ever learn of anyone else who saw this thing on that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report is submitted from same IP as several other reports, submitted in rapid sequence.

A female student I knew lived in an apartment house (west side of the street) across the street from mine. She and I went through the hall of her apartment building to a second floor porch.  We stood out there for about 20 minutes looking at a silver disk-shaped craft which was hovering just above treeline to the south-southwest of the porch.  It had multicolor lights which were blinking at a slow rate from left to right, like a movie marquee.  The lights were approximately around the horizontal middle of the craft. When a small airplane approached from the north and got within a couple of miles, the lights on the UFO blinked very rapidly from left to right, then the whole craft disappeared.  This happened during the early evening and it was completely light outside.  It was difficult to judge distance or size, but my fist held at arms length would maybe have covered it, and my finger would not.  I think it was a block or two away.  The woman acquaintance was a student about 20 years old.  I was a biology student and worked at a local hospital as a nurse&#39;s aide.  I am now a registered nurse.<n>

We were there several hours.  Around three o&#39;clock a HUGE silver saucer craft glided silently down from the sky and followed the contours of the hills landing on the other side of the hill from us, probably 1/2 to 1 mile away.  We could not see the craft from where we were standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we were scared and then about 20 minutes later, when nothing happened, we decided to &#34;live and let live&#34; and went on searching for bottles.  About an hour and half later we heard three electronic beeps from the other side of the hill.  It was then we decided to leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day a friend of ours told us he had seen the craft come down near our property from his place on the other side of town (about 10 miles away) and wondered if we had seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as I know this siting was never reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was very entranced by this and they were extremely clear to the naked eye.  They did not move sideways, but as stated above.  I&#39;m not sure how high they were, but would guess about 3-5 thousand feet up, about the height of a plane at the mid-line of take-off.  When I arrived home, my roommates stated that there was something on TV that UFOs were seen by a number of people who had called this in.  I told them I saw them, and they said they would not have believed it if I hadn&#39;t said that as they were in disbelief.  I will never forget it.  I haven&#39;t seen anything like it before nor since.  What was so outstanding to me was not only the shape of the objects, but the beautiful silver look without any glare from the bright sunlight.  I had to go on because the light had already changed for a few minutes, and there were a lot of vehicles behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

He may not recall this as he was only eight years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report relates to the Sighting Report filed by the Police Captain and occurred within the Mansfield, Ohio city limits just south of the west end of Cook Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After an early dinner our son went out to ride his bicycle while his mother and I finished our meal. It was a clear, sunny and beautiful early evening. Our son ran into the house, out of breath and said that a space ship just chased him on his bicycle and he ran into the house. Our son was NOT prone to exaggeration but after a casual glance outside on our part, we dismissed the subject and idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> His description of the craft was that it was shaped like a cigar and had red, blue and green flashing lights. He said that it got &#34;real close&#34; to him but I don&#39;t know what the distance might have been. No mention was made of any noise comming from the craft and he did not say what happened to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Parents learn lessons the hard way sometime. That evening on the news out of Cleveland, 65 miles to the north east of Mansfield, it was reported that a military helicopter on a flight from Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio on it&#39;s way to Cleveland had to take evasive action to avoid a collision with a cigar shaped UFO with red, blue and green flashing lights. The encounter occurred over Mansfield, Ohio in the same time frame as our son&#39;s experience. The pilot was interviewed along with his co-pilot and both men were highly respected by the military and were considered honest. I had heard, years later, that this was one of the best documented and most reliable accounts on record. Also, years after the experience, there was a notice in the Mansfield News Journal newspaper that research was being done on this very incident. Witnesses were being sought and the intent was to interview them and get their consent to undergo hypnosis for in depth acquisition of data. I responded to this notice in writing and my letter was returned, unopened, several weeks later claiming that no such address existed in Columbus, Ohio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, neither his mother nor I ever dismissed his inputs to us thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/20/73 15:15|Mansfield|OH|Cigar|20 minutes|In the Fall of 1973 my sister and I came upon a large silver object hovering approximatley 20 feet above us on a clear, sunny afternoon|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04424.html|9|ndxe197309| In the Fall of 1973 my sister and I came upon a large silver object hovering approximatley 20 feet above us on a clear, sunny afternoon in a heavily populated residential area. We walked around and underneath the craft for 15 or 20 minutes while it remained motionless and soundless above what should have been a busy, suburban street. Without apparent means the craft suddenly shot straight up into a small cloud and drifted away. We both completly forgot about this incident for 3 years. I think it is also relevant that both of us felt then and now that we are missing a 24 hour period of our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please forgive me in advance if this narrative seems to ramble. Frankly I am a little trepeditious of relaying the events of that afternoon 25 years ago. I am still fearful of what I saw but I am more afraid of what I cannot remember. My hope is that by relaying this bit of truth I might be able to let go of some of the isolation I feel in a forum of like-minded individuals and perhaps make contact with someone who also saw what we saw. As for autobiography I am a 41 year old Police Captain who has led a relatively normal life of ups and downs, good times and bad. I had an average childhood and an interesting adult life of travel. love affairs and advanced education. I suppose I&#39;m just pretty damned average in every way except for this nagging experience which continues to haunt me. In either September or October of 1973 at approximately 1515 hours, my sister ((Name deleted)) (13yoa) and I (16yoa) had just been dropped off by our school bus in front of our house. We were living in a heavily populated suburban area of Mansfield Ohio in the ((Address deleted)) block of Cook Road. Cook Road itself is a busy two lane street and, although our section was mostly residential, a school and a convenience store were both within half a block from where we stood. Our house was at the base of two gradually sloping hills amidst dozens of homes on both sides of the street. I had exited the bus before my sister and stood waiting for her on the sidewalk. As she stepped from the bus and it pulled away I was startled to see a large object hovering over the street where the school bus had been. I pointed it out to my sister and we both stood captivated by it&#39;s appearance and proximity. The craft was approximatly 40 feet long and 15 or 20 feet tall. It hovered silently 35 or 40 feet overhead and had lights encircling it&#39;s cigar-shaped structure. I believe there was a larger red light on one end and a green light on the other but the rest of the smaller lights were multicolored. It was of a metal which looked like brushed aluminium and had no visible means of levitation or propulsion, no wings or propellers. I walked into the street underneath the craft and accross the street to see it from the other side. There were no numbers or letters of any kind displayed and I could not see any seams for the release of landing apparatus. At one point I picked up a rock to hear what it would sound like bounced against the exterior but my sister disuaded me from throwing it. I remember we were becomming increasingly distressed when I was not able to identify this object and by the fact we were alone. It had been at least 15 minutes since we first saw the craft and during this time, remarkably, no one had passed by. No one came out onto their front porch, no other kids walked the sidewalks and no cars drove by. In retrospect this seems absurd given the time of day and usual traffic on Cook Road. When I returned to the side of the street on which my sister stood I now saw a small black oval slightly above the row of lights. We thought it might be a window and waved but there was no response. Several minutes later the craft silently shot up and into a small cumulus cloud which drifted away. I remember my sister asking me what it was to which I replied &#34;I don&#39;t know. do you think it could be one of those UFO&#39;s the paper&#39;s been writing about?&#34; We were both excited and scared as we walked into our ho! use whereupon we both completely forgot about it. Although we had no apparant memory of the event I recall that we were both very upset with our mother whom we accused of leaving us for a 24 hour period. Mom insisted she had never done such a thing but we were convinced we had experienced a full 24 hours without her. This missing time was particularly perplexing to both of us and, to this day, remains a disturbing reality. I know that I am missing a day, but I cannot explain it. Three years after our encounter I had a sudden recall of the events described above while talking about the cosmos with some college friends. I called my sister and asked her if she had ever seen a flying saucer. At first she said no but when I mentioned the school bus in Ohio she also had a sudden realization and literally gasped on the phone. Her memory of the event is almost exactly like my own including the little window and the strange missing time. There&#39;s a lot more to tell about subsequent related occurances and some strange stories of little men I used to tell to my mother when I was very young but this is the heart of the matter. Life goes on but I sure wish I could understand the &#34;what&#39;s&#34; and the &#34;why&#34;s&#34;  of this event.<n>

I had just taken out my mums dogs for a last walk for the night.  I got as far as the driveway when I typically looked up.  It was a beautiful night and the sky was clear, no moon, no wind.  the amount of sky i was looking at varied considerably because of trees, powerlines other houses to include my own.  as I started to walk a blink of light caught my eye out of the west.  I didn&#39;t think much of it at first because it was quite a distance in altitude.  But then I saw what appeared to be the same blinking light again only this time it was in a different place in sky.  When I say blinking the light would momentarily go out and it would reappear in another part of the sky. So if you can imagine I was piviting from right to left watching this light make a perfect square in the sky.  So at every corner point it would reappear at the next corner. Finally upon completing a perfect square it shot off to the north at incredible speed to the point it left a shimmering trail that did not last long. The amount of sky that this light covered was to say the least amazing. The speed in which it completed the square no past nor present aircraft could make those kind of manuevers.  I was 13 at the time.  I have since completed 20 years in the Air Force and I can tell I know as I did then as I do know now the dynamics of aircraft.  This was no terrestrial aircraft.  I believe while watching this light I was encountering an intelligence.  This part in unexplainable on my part, but I just felt as if the movements of this light had a purpose.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Early to mid AM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This report is in response to the 9/20/73 incident in Mansfield , Ohio which was reported January 1999. I have just now read this and am compelled to send in the account of my observation , which is remarkable only in that it occurred one mile NW from the location of the 9/20/73 incident. Regrettably, I can only narrow the date to between 1972 and 1974, though it did occur during the regular school year. I was a pupil of the Woodland Elementary school at the time. It was early to mid morning with clear skies. I was leaning with my back against a SW wall looking south when I looked up. I do not know why I looked up, but when I did I immediately saw an oval image directly overhead moving slowly from west to east. It was pure white with a slight homogenous glow over its shape.  The major axis of the oval was several full moon widths long and the minor axis was about half of the major. The edges were slightly  fuzzy due to the glow. The image had no colors or marks and I did not hear any sound from it. The lack of markings or sharp edges prevented me from judging it’s altitude, but I did have the impression that it was low, maybe tree top level.  I observed this for three to six seconds until it passed out of view behind the school roof. I paused for just enough seconds to say to myself, “what in the...?”, then ran away from the building expecting to see it again. If it had maintained it’s velocity, I would have definitely seen it in the clear sky, but it was gone. Other kids were outside, but none were looking up. I wish I could provide a more accurate date, but I do not even recall what season it was. I am fairly sure of the year range, so there is a chance that it may have been 9/20/73.<n>

It changed directions a few times then seemed to be accelerating towards earth, because the tiny faint star increased it&#39;s level of brightness probably 25 to 50 times in brightness.  It then turned and seemed to be gowing away and at an angle to what seemed like the east, then accelerated quickly and suddenly vanished within a short distance in the sky, like a shooting star, but simply could not have been, due to all of the directional changes and starting out so faint and slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very similar event again happened to me in Washington State in the late winter of about 1999.

We ended up playing around the northbound and southbound rt. 690 bridges over the Seneca river, just outside of the village of Baldwinsville, N.Y..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess that we irritated a motorist or two while fooling around.  One of us noticed what he thought was a police helicopter looking for us with a spotlight.  We quickly hid under one of the bridges trying to avoid being spotted by the chopper and it&#39;s light.  We kept looking out around the bridge girders trying to see what the helicopter was doing when someone else noticed that there was NO helicopter sound at all.  It was entirely silent although we figured it to be only a few hundred feet above us.  I also noticed that there was no traffic anymore although previously it was relatively steady.  We started to get scared as the spotlight continued, we thought, looking for us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were trying to figure out what to do next, it was like the light and craft (?) got tired of looking for us and it started to slowly move towards the village, over the river, and shining its light to the left bank, then the right bank, then left, then right, and kept repeating that maneuver &#39;till it disappeared.  As soon as it was out of sight, the traffic started appearing again!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all quite scared and bewildered and left the area immediately!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than between ourselves, we heard nothing of the incident from anyone else (apparently, no one had reported anything).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in September 1973 is approximate.

It was my job to find what others had missed and detail was part of my daily routine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ....Also, while in the Air Force, I taught instrument flying techniques and procedures.  I am quite familiar with aircraft and have lived my life with an objective eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Story, objective side:<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving (after sundown, before dusk, with wife and two youngsters, only car on the road) just outside of town we spotted a soft white &#39;glowing&#39; object. &#39;It&#39; was hovering a few feet off the ground about forty yards from the highway to our left. It was shaped something like a slender football, maybe twelve feet long (including the aura) with rounded ends, although the shape was somewhat obscurred by something of an &#39;aura&#39; around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ....While the object was close to the ground, nor at any other time, I did not notice any reflection from the glow and it was not necessary to squint while looking at it. There was no audible sound and no discernible markings or lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had slowed down to observe through my open side window and the &#39;object&#39; began moving parallel with us..... I stopped. The &#39;object&#39; continued slowly approx fifty yards, rising to about forty feet, and made a ninety degree right turn, came to my side of the road and made another rt turn and came straight at us. The shape at this point was approx. five feet wide by four feet high, as though a front view. (About that time I was very excited and had my eyes glued on it.) ....At any rate, the object, just over the power lines (maybe 25 feet), hovered right over the top of the car for a moment and then quite suddenly disappeared - in the blink of an eye! My next focus, amidst bewilderment, was on one of a few stars which had braved the twilight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subjective: I sensed communication, that the &#39;object&#39; was not a vehicle, but life/intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife&#39;s objective description is the same as mine, the children remember that they saw the object, but nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Perhaps someone would be kind enough to point me to a more suitable site?  In September, 1973, a neighbour and I were intending to drive to Port Alberni, a  city about one hour away, in a northwest direction from my home in Nanaimo, BC.  We left my house around 10 am, drove about a half hour north, and we both clearly remember turning west onto the highway leading towards Port Alberni.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, our next clear recollection occurred about seven hours later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We suddenly found ourselves on a dirt road, with the car motor running, and it was after five oclock.  There was absolutely no memory for either of us, of how we had spent the missing hours.  My friend was absolutely terrified, crying and shaking uncontrollably.  On my part, I was deeply puzzled about where we were, slightly shaken, but not really frightened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we did not know where we were, after a few minutes, I simply started driving in the direction my car was pointed.  After about 10 minutes, we reached the Island Highway, but we were roughly one hour south of where we started out in Nanaimo.  The place we re-entered the Island Highway was one and a half hours south or about 80 miles from where we both remember turning onto the Alberni Highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have absolutely no conscious memory of aliens, a craft, or anything of that nature, but I know that this experience can have few other explanations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  We have contacted the witness and requested a report from the second party.  The individual who submitted this report is a highly educated professional.  We have proposed to the person that further investigation into the incident is possible, and may yield more information with regard to what may have taken place on that day.  PD))<n>

I woke up to an &#34;instant awake&#34; and looked out over the ocean and saw some fast moving lights in the distance that just stopped, turned and then started heading toward where I was. I sensed it was heading toward me so  I ran into my roomates room to wake him up.  The next memory I had was standing outside looking up at the bottom of a craft from about 15 feet.  I can still hear the sound of the engine as it moved away slowly.  My roomate was standing in the doorway and looked frightened.  At the time I called the Air Force Station and they suggested I report it to a UFO &#34;club&#34; or something.  I called and they sent someone out, but I never filled out the form.  They had told me that I would get a pin or something and become an &#34;Official&#34; member. I was not interested in that. The interviewer was weird. I did, however see a report in the paper, Orange County Register, the day after that a number of people had reported seeing a UFO from Los Angeles to San Diego.  (Laguna is in the middle).  Years later I went back to get a copy of the article, but left it behind after a divorce.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of three reports by this witness.

At the time, I saw an article the following day in the Santa Ana Register that many others had spotted UFOs in that sky that evening.  For fun, I called the library a few weeks ago and they found the article and it is Dated October 24, 1973.  I had put down September 1 as I knew it was sometime around then when I was living there.  I do not know if the actual date is important, if so, could you change it?  Also, would you like to have a<n> <n><n> copy of the newspaper article?  Also, while searching for  the one I had remembered seeing, they found another dated October 18th about a man that had been frightened and reported seeing a UFO to<n> <n><n> police.  They are sending me that article as well. The librarian said that they had also come across an article from 1991 making reference to a number of sightings made in Orange County in 1973.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested the articles alluded to above, and the correct date of the 1973 sighting.

Up ,down across, up, down across..this was going on for some time, then in a split second moved to another location and started the pattern.  One of the eyewitness ran inside and got on the phone to alert a friend of the siting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then an erie whisper , a bright white light and a whisper sound an disc shaped object was about 20 feet in the ais and about 10 feet away from us.

Sparks and what looked like debri were falling from object leaving a long trail to the sides and behind object.  The object, when right above us, was about half the size of our lot which is 50 feet wide.  Although it looked as though it was not very high up, we could not tell how high it was.  As it passed beyond our house towards the city (7 miles away), it looked as though it would crash downtown.  Later we heard on the radio that it had crashed on the Chapman Ranch about 150 miles or so from San Antonio.  The next morning the news reported that it was thought to be a piece of a Russian satellite and that a scientific team from Trinity University (San Antonio, Tx) was being sent to investigate. We made several calls to authorities and the airport but no one had seen anything.  What was so strange is that no one that we asked had seen anything either. There was never anything else mentioned in the news about it. It was such a large object that it would be impossible to miss seeing it. We thought even if it was just a Russian satellite, it should have been a huge news story.  My husband and I were professionals working in the computer industry when this occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
9/10/73 17:00|Moss Point|MS|Circle|3 hours overall approx.|it was round and glowing like a full moon, the color was sort of a white or gray|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34129.html|21|ndxe197309| I was 7 at the time of the sighting. I was riding my bike on our street when I looked at our house and noticed green smoke above our house. I told my cousin who was 6 and in the front yard. I went in the house and told my mother about it. I remember she was frying chicken and at first did not believe me but she finally came outside with me and saw the same thing. The smoke had almost all faded away when this object apeared out of nowhere above our house. It looked close enough you could have thrown a rock up at it and hit it. I assume we were looking up at the bottom of it, it was round and glowing like a full moon, the color was sort of a white or gray, it looked metalic. I remember there were several neighbors around  that saw it. My father came home and he saw it, I remember him saying &#34;come on down here&#34; and my mother telling him to shutup. It suddenly disapeared before our eyes, I don&#39;t think it vanished but it just moved away very fast. After it vanished the green smoke apeared again and then slowly faded away. It repeated this again later, maybe an hour, im not sure, my mother had called the police, but it had vanished again by the time they got there. She even called Keesler Air Force Base to see if there was any weather balloons out or anything and they said no. I remember later the same night the door bell started ringing rappidly and it was 2 teenage girls very scared saying that they had seen a ufo but it was not above our house like we had seen it was a little distance from them and they could see the side of it, I remember them saying it had blinking lights around the side, I dont remember what colors and they said it was moving and an airplane was moving toward it and it suddenly disapeared. Later after the girls left, we were looking up in the air in the front yard and we saw a a orange colored streak in the air above us but this looked a great distance in the air, high or higher than an airplane, the object making the streak was round and also looked orange and then it looked like it made a couple of small circles and the object got smaller and smaller and disapeared.The object never made a sound any of the times we saw it. I was only 7 at the time but it seemed like it was a couple days later when the Pascagoula ufo incident occured where the 2 men where abducted by aliens. I sometimes tell people what I saw, some believe me and others get a laugh out of it, but I don&#39;t get mad at them because if I hadn&#39;t seen it I might be sceptical about ufo&#39;s and life on other planets..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had some friends who worked in a garage across the river in montandon Pa. and started walking over the bridge to see if they had heard the report on the radio . It was somewhat foggy on the river .I was three forths accross the bridge when I looked north up river towards milton when i saw what I thought was a large boat drifting toward the railroad bridge in front of the bridge I was on and I thought to yell at it because It was going to hit the bridge ! There was no sound , I noticed as it got closer that tis object was lighted with red, green and blue pulsating lights and that they formed a triangle ,I remember thinking of how this reminded me of an outline of a Christmas tree. Just as I was going to yell at this craft to prevent it from hitting the bridge I noticed a fire develope from the bottom of it , a deep orange fire . It then shot off , straight up into the sky. I watched it ascend and noticed that there was a small plane also heading south high up and I thought that it would be hit by this ufo but it flew right by the plane and the plane did not even seem to see it ? I asked my friends at the garage if they had seen it and they said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I splashed cold water on my face and looked at myself in the mirror.  Slowly I started to come to myself about two class periods later and was able to make it to class.  Later that evening, I told my sisters and brothers about what had happened.  They believed me. I didn&#39;t tell anyone else (until today)  My family agrees that it seems as if I was drugged.

He recommended that I forward this to you and spoke highly of your efforts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here, then, is my e-mail to him in part.  I removed an introductory paragraph as well as my name from the body of the text.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best regards and good luck  &#34;The year was either 1972 or &#39;73 to the best of my recollection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the back yard of our house on Robbins AFB one evening with my Father, an active duty major at the time, and would have been around 9 years old.  I saw some strangely colored stray clouds (which in hindsight were probably very slightly colored by the sun that was no longer above the horizon) and had asked Dad to explain what I was seeing when a bright blue circular image suddenly formed in the sky as if someone had removed the cover from a spotlight and had projected an image onto a screen in the sky.  The disk was slightly larger in appearance than the actual moon, which was on the opposite horizon.  I called for my younger brother, sister and mom and we watched this disk as it remained stationary for several minutes then slowly dissipated over a period of time as if air movement was breaking up the &#34;screen.&#34;   We were all very familiar with the local aircraft, beacon lights, etc. as Dad was a pilot and he couldn’t explain the phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was stationary while it held together and did not appear to have an active source such as beam of light.  There was no sound coming from the object.  Its relative brightness was somewhat more intense that a full moon on a clear night.  It was a balmy night with widely scattered clouds. To the best of my memory it was halfway up in the south western sky from my vantage point.  My impression was that someone projected an image in the sky that left a glowing blue stain on fog or cloud particles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our next door neighbor, another USAF officer, saw us looking skyward and came out.  He was also fascinated and at a loss to explain the phenomenon.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We express our gratitude to the witness, and to Tom Sheets, Founder of GUFOG, for sharing the report.  PD))<n>
