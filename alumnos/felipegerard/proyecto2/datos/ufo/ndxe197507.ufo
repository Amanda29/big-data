This group was devoted to silance and prayer. They were all constructed of huge stone (like a castle) The last monastery I had to inspect this brother could talk. In addition to asking a lot of religious question, I finally got around to asking him what he thought of UFO&#39;s and if there was any religious conitation to them..he told me to follow him, which I did we went up on the roof and he showed me this large (about 3 acre) stone enclosure, simular to the others I saw at the other monasteries. He said these are the landing fields where they will eventually land..my hair stood straight up..I have never told anyone about these experiences untils now, I think I feel better..<n>

Then a cone started down from it that was orange and turned to yellow thats when i called the other guys i was working with to look at this . These guys watched for a little while then ran back in the dog house[ tool shed ] they were afraid of it . I finally got them back out and we watched the cone come down and a smaller yellow ball appeared at the bottom about 1/2 the size of the orange ball. By this time it was starting to get light out and the lighter it got the more transparent the ufo got till it was completly daylight and you couldent see it but it was still there . The state police were called to this area because of lights flying around they acknowledge seeing lights but couldent explain them i read that in the paper six mounths earlier .

We were driving through the Shawnee National Forest heading North. The sky was moonless and pitch black as we drove through the Forrest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly a brilliant white light appeared ahead of us high above the road.  It was like some one had opened a door in the middle of a black sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a couple of seconds a glowing red orb began to slowly float down out of the light towards the tree line then another red orb appeared slightly to the right and also floated down at the same speed as the other orb. Both orbs floated down behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as we saw the orbs enter the forrest the brilliant white light just dissapeared...like someone turned off a light switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were really spooked by this and sped up to get out of the forest as soon as possible.<n>

As I started into the house, for some reason, I turned and looked up into the starlit sky and caught sight of a cigar-shaped craft. My first impression was, that i was seeing a conventional aircraft fuselage, but it had no wings or tail and was completely silent. I could see round windows or portholes in the craft as it traveled from east to west. I grabbed my binoculars by the door and was able to observe the craft for another 3 seconds before it disappeared over the house.<n>
7/20/75 12:00|Blackstone|MA|Disk|15 minutes|On a clear sunny day we observed a round black-appearing stationary disk near a cloud overhead for five minutes when it accelerated|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42294.html|7|ndxe197507| On a clear sunny day we observed a round black-appearing stationary disk near a cloud overhead for five minutes when it accelerated<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were 18 years old at the time and were riding our bicycles on Mendon St. in Blackstone, Massachusetts on a beautiful, clear, sunny day with a few clouds when I happened to look up and see a round disk that appeared to be black in color just staying in one spot near a cloud overhead at about the 11 o&#39;clock position as we were facing west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got off our bikes and watched the object for about five minutes in its stationary position. It made no noise of any kind. It then,literally, accelerated at tremendous speed to a point 45 degrees to the west and below the treeline about five miles away. The point where we were standing was atop a hill above the surrounding area. Within another second or so it began rising above the treeline to the northwest. After a few seconds of rising above the treeline to a point about 45 degrees in declination, it began quickly accelerating  up and down and side to side in 180 degree reversals of direction while wobbling. It remained black in color throughout this 10 minute period from the start of our observation, again making no noise and was now positioned about five to seven miles distant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also appeared to have a slight atmospheric disturbance around its immediate periphery. I could not believe what this object was doing in terms of its erratic movements, apparently without being affected by the force of gravity. If it were, all on board would have been crushed to death due to their own inertia.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then came toward us and again was almost directly overhead at the one o&#39;clock position facing Nortwest but very low perhaps no nore than a few thousand feet. It was highly polished, appearing black because it appeared to be reflecting light. It tilted downward towards us and I could then see the shiny metallic-chrome looking surface with an elevated central section, about one-third the diameter of the craft. It then righted itself and slowly moved away back over the treeline to the west where it had disappeared over the treeline the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen weather balloons, aircraft of all types and even the SR-71 Blackbird at several hundred feet of altitude in 1965 when it was still top-secret. I could see the pilots with their spacehelmets on throught the cockpit windows and the red pin stripes that surrounded the fuselage.I did not find out what it was until 1975 when I saw it in an Air Force recruiting station. I have seen videos of UFO&#39;s that looked and acted exactly like the one I saw on television, and have downloaded pictures online several years ago of the object that I saw as photographed by others all over the world. Those pictures show the same black-appearing underside that I saw when looking up at the craft, and also the shiny metallic chrome-like upper surface when obseving the craft at an angle from the side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am convinced that the black on the underside only appears black because it reflects light, and at certain angles, much like a mirror can appear to be black to an outside observer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a science teacher and an amateur astronomer with an 18&#34; Obsession telescope with Binovision. I am thoroughly versed in astronomy and the sciences and I can tell you unequivocally that this craft was definitely not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few years ago I downloaded a picture taken by someone in Switzerland in 1975,the same year as my observation, and I have e-mailed it to you using your hyperlink. I hope this is helpful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My mother and I watched the object for perhaps another 15 to 20 minutes.  The object did not move for all of that time.  Finally, the object zoomed away to the north or north-west, first dipping &#34;down&#34; maybe 5 degrees and then turning &#34;up&#34; at a sharp angle, disappearing in less than one second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We could not stop talking about it that night and decided that we would go up into the foothills by our home the next day to search for it.  It seemed so low, like only a thousand feet above us.  I recently read a book called &#34;Search for the Skinwalker&#34; which made reference to a military base in Montana that had logged a glowing round UFO crossing their skies that same night back in 1975.  So I thought I would file a report here and see if any other Spokane-area people witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1975 may be approximate.  PD))<n>

Rectangle 100 feet by 30 feet by two-storeys high, 80 feet from witness at about 150 feet altitude, hovered above 80 acre field about 45 feet from farmer-witness&#39; hay barn at about 11:00 p.m. in July, 1975.  No Sound.  Object totally illuminated by steady yellow light almost as if it looked like a yellow shape of fire.  [NOTE:  Several 18-inch &#34;globs&#34; of yellowish fiery looking light, shaped like huge droplets, dropped from beneath UFO, but never reached the ground, simply disappearing as they fell or descended - not a stream or beam - these were &#34;globs&#34; and farmer associated a STRONG SULPHUR SMELL with these globs.  He likened the &#34;globs&#34; to shape of 30-weight motor oil when poured out in cold weather.]  As witness walked slowly toward UFO, it eased back.  When he backed up, UFO eased forward.  Finally, witness heard a &#34;click&#34; (as when a light switch is activated) and the next thing he knew, the UFO was gone and all was dark.  Witness did NOT check the time before or after the event, so the time span is only his perception of time passage.  Witness holds deep religious convictions, and investigator believes he is very credible.

We got tired and went to bed.I have been hesitant to tell anyone this story because my family and close friends never did believe me and still tease me about it to this day.I would guess there were about one dozen of these boomerang shaped crafts.All had a red light in the center and although it was dark,appeared to be solid gray or black.They appeared to be hovering over the town of Dover as we faced them and watched intently for so long.Once the police laughed at me,what was I to do?Who else could I call?It feels so good to finally tell my story to someone who doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy.I know what I saw.Thanks for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I was about 13 years old at the time.  The ships were traveling from West to East and took approximately eight seconds to pass completely overhead, until they became obscured by a row of large trees at the East end of our property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three ships were flying in a V formation and were identical to each other in shape, size and color. They were shaped like birds; similar in shape to the dove logo used on &#34;Dove&#34; soap.  The  nose at the front of each ship was turned slightly downward, as were the wings; with one wing located at each side of each ship.  The tail on each ship was turned slightly upward and was slightly pointed at its tip.  The ships made no sound and there were no blinking lights nor any other colors; only the bright, glowing neon green color which emanated from the ships. The surface of the ships were smooth, like glass.  I did not see any windows nor any other markings on the ships.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pinched my left arm very hard to make sure that I was not dreaming as the ships passed over me.  After the ships passed overhead and behind the trees, I climbed down from the roof and ran to the West end of our driveway to see if I could get another look at them over the tops of the trees but they were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside and watched the news on TV that night and also for the next three nights and checked the newspapers too but no one ever mentioned these ships.  I went out onto the roof every chance I could for the next week or so and stared off into the sky, hoping to get another look, but the ships never appeared again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never heard of anyone else seeing ships like these on any UFO show.  I also did not see anyone on this web site mention seeing this type of ship.  It&#39;s always the same: saucers, triangles, cigars, orbs and the like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days after my sighting, I remember speaking with my father about it.  I was frustrated that I hadn&#39;t seen any news story about this amazing event.  My father said that I must have been dreaming. But I know that I was not dreaming and that I really did see these ships.  I was not intoxicated in any way and I know that what I saw was real.  The sighting was not due to some sort of psychological trauma either. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time, I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later,  I thought that it was strange that the ships I had seen back in 1975 had a shape very similar to the Concord, which did not enter commercial service until 1976.  The Concord was designed to travel at supersonic speeds, with the most aerodynamically efficient shape.  How could I have known what that shape should be at the age of 13, without ever having seen the Concord?   Although the nose of the ships I saw were pointed slightly downward like the Concord, the wings of the ships I saw were quite different.  They were more like a bird&#39;s wings that arced downward, which were slightly pointed at the tips, rather than the horizontal/flat shaped wings of the Concord.  Plus, the ships I saw made no sound, glowed green and flew in a V formation, so I am sure they were not Concords.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else saw these type of ships, I would love to hear from you, as I feel like a freak amongst UFO witnesses and that is a very sad thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

While driving home after a visit I was approximately 2 miles west of Smithland,Ky traveling east on US 60.  I noticed five amber colored lights in the shape of a triangle in the eastern sky.  The lights were steady glowing and very bright.  I slowed to try to determine whether or not they were moving and found they were definately moving from east to west very slowly.  I could&#39;nt tell if it was just one object or five separate ones until I stopped my car and got out.  It did appear to be one solid object. It also appeared to be very large.  I would estimate at least a quarter mile wide at the back part.  I continued to observe the object as I drove into the city limits of Smithland.  I then turned west on Court Street which is a dead end at the Cumberland River.  I stopped the car and continued to watch the lights until they went out of sight behind a woods on the Illinois shore.  I found out later  that similar objects had been sighted along the East coast around that same time.  I was a dispatcher for The Livingston County Sheriff&#39;s Department at the time and found that no one else had reported anything that same night. Guess I was lucky to have seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then it started to land just behind a few trees that were widely spaced apart and it landed on the lawn in a field across from us which was approx. 250 meters from where we were at, and we got scared and got back in our VW Beetle (New) and we got out of there. It was very terrifying at the time and we were very scared about what happened. There was no one around at all, no cars, people, etc. Nothing at all. I just wanted to share this experience because I think we all have been in shock and disbelief for so long about this experience. I am just now decideing to share my information about this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It looked to be only skimming the top of the school and the mall,  and was at least the size of a football field.  It was rectangular in shape, dark grey, dull metallic appearance. Seemed to have many compartments or components on the bottom, and had one red light following behind it.  It had a peaceful feeling, and I felt no fear.  My friend however, was terrified and wouldn&#39;t look at it. I haven&#39;t been in touch with this person for years, and she would never talk about it.  It was travelling from the east in a northwest direction... directly toward the local air base.  Although it seemed to be barely moving, it was getting out of sight rather quickly.  I raced home and called the control tower at the base, and they said they had seen nothing.  They told me I had likely seen the &#34;Thunderbirds&#34; who were there at the time ! for an air show.  Even though other sightings had been reported the same week of a &#34;flying door&#34; less than 30 miles from where I saw it,  the reaction of most people was disbelief and/or mockery.  After coming across this site more than 30 years later, I feel somewhat vindicated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It crossed over the road about half a mile south of our position.  A second or two later I saw a military fighter jet that appeared to be following the object on the same trajectory.  The jet was moving at a much slower rate of speed by comparison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both the object and the jet were high enough to reflect the sun that had, from our point of view, already gone down behind Long’s Peak whose summit is 14,256’ above sea level.  Both object and jet disappeared from view after they crossed over the mountains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my husband and my teen-aged nephew, both of whom saw the object and the military jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am presently a psychoanalyst in private practice.  Before I changed careers, I was chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S.  Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature.  I consider myself to be a curious, careful and scientifically oriented observer.  My husband was a civil engineer.<n>

I believe this is one of the first documented triangle sightings.    I had a witness.  My friend and I came in contact with not one but two ufo on the same night within an hour of each other.  One of the UFO’s came within 3-4 feet of where we were standing. We were able to get an extremely good view of the object.  Doesn’t  this fall under the category of a close encounter of the 2nd kind?   The experience lasted approximately 10 minutes, it was way more than just seeing lights in the sky – there is absolutely no doubt the two craft were working in tandem.  The account can be documented because there was an article in the local newspaper the next day.   My friend and I  have maintained contact over the years only because this was such a terrifying and profound experience we have to contact each and talk the event over  from time to ! time.   We would gladly take a lie detector test.  I could take you to the exact area today.  Who knows – there might be trace readings of high than normal radioactivity.   In all my years of reading UFO reports not one time have I run across an incident where people came in contact with   two separate ufo’s on the same night much less come within a few feet of one.   I would think this information would be very valuable as scientific information within the ufology field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other thing before I go on with the story – I posted my sighting here on the NUFORC website. I’ve gone back from time to time toreread it and now, as of today it’s no longer there and has been removed from the reports.  Why?  A friend and I had gone fishing one evening in July 1973 on a private estate located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The estate is located on land next to a tributary which opens in to the Chesapeake Bay. My friend’s parents were the groundskeepers of the estate. My friend and his family also lived in a house on the property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about dusk we were sitting on a section of bulk head with fishing lines in the water, a portable radio playing near by, radio volume low. My friend&#39;s car was parked approx. 3-4 feet behind us with the passenger and driver&#39;s side doors open - the dome light inside the car was lit. Behind the car was an open field - no vegetation at the time - on the opposite side of the field approx. 50 yards was a wooded area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point I happened to glance over my right shoulder and noticed a light in the woods. The light was about the size, color and intensity of a large flashlight. It was moving through the woods waist high from the ground - moving at about walking speed. At the time, the first thing I thought was that my friend&#39;s father was walking through the woods with a flashlight. I didn’t pay it any particular attention and turned my head back in the direction of my fishing line and the water.Looking back on the event I realize now there would have been no reason for his father to be in the woods at that hour much less with a flashlight in hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx. 1-2 minutes later I glanced back again toward the direction where I had previously seen the light - now I could see the light had left the wooded tree line and was moving across the field in a direct straight path towards my friend and I. I nudged my friend on the elbow and said: &amp;quot;Look at that&amp;quot;. We could see the light was an orb about the size or slightly larger than a softball. Glowing a white/yellow color - not particularly bright. The shape of the orb was perfectly round. The light contained within. The surface of the orb was not smooth but had a rather fuzzy appearance. Just a perfect sphere of light. As it crossed the field towards us - it moved at about walking pace and was about waist high from the ground. No sound. It simply floated through the air in a very straight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now my friend and I had dropped our fishing poles and were standing up. We watched the orb approach his car.  It slowed down as it reached the trunk then slowly glided up to the middle on the roof of the car, stopped and hovered.   This thing was under intelligent control and seemed as if it was very interested in the car,  as if it were checking it out.    It seemed to be very curious. It hovered approx. 1-2 minutes then began to slowly move off to the right toward some nearby trees. When it reached the trees - it climbed to tree top level and moved over the top of the trees. That&#39;s where we lost sight of it. I can remember as we were watching the orb hover above his car literally a few feet away I could see my friend out of my peripheral vision - he and I were absolutely frozen with fear. We could not move. I realized at that moment this thing was nothing I had ever seen before in my life,  was under intelligent control and could probably do with us whatever it wanted t! o. After we lost sight of the orb we immediately got in his car and drove the very short distance to his parents’ house and told them what we had just witnessed. We left the radio and fishing gear behind.  About 10 to 15 minutes later my friend and I, his mother, father, sister walked out  into their front yard and looked up towards the sky. Now it was dark and you could see stars.  At not too high off an altitude we notice a dark triangular shaped craft with large white round lights outlining the two longest edges of the “V” shape.  The craft would travel at what appeared to be a short distance at an incredible rate of speed, literally stop on a dime then make sharp right angled turns. The G force alone would have killed a human.  We watched for a few minutes then eventually the craft moved straight up until we lost sight of it. The story can be documented as my mother called the local newspaper the next day to report what we had seen. I remember seeing a very small articl! e in the paper within the next day or so. I have not been back! to the sight since that evening however I have located the exact spot where this occurred on Google Earth.<n>

Suddenly, what appeared to be a light about the same size of a bright star started moving in a South to North path and then stopped moving almost directly overhead.  Then, several minutes later that same bright light started moving again at a 90 degree angle to its first movement directly to the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date probably is approximate.

The youth had apparently found the one man with the craft open while trail riding a mini-bike. The youth claims to have seen a circle cut in the grass as for a teepee with his freinds before the incident. The craft to have three landing stilts or legs opened from the under side was metalic or silver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

He was 13 years old at the time and was on his way to the ((deleted)) Church with his two sisters around 6:30PM. As his oldest sister was driving North on Anoka County Road 5 they all noticed cars pulled over to the shoulder on each side of the road near the 167th Avenue NW intersection. Fearing an accident had occurred she slowed the vehicle down as they neared the intersection. However, to their surprise, no cars seemed to be damaged and the occupants of the parked vehicles were standing outside gazing up into the Western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just about the time they passed the crossing, ((witness)) looked out his passenger window and saw what appeared to be a large disk shaped craft which he estimated to be around the size of 2 Rambler homes (250-300&#39; in diameter.) It appeared to be about a half mile away near a farm and estimated about 160&#39; in the air. He became very afraid and began screaming at his sister to turn around, get out of there and head back home. His sister obliged when they also saw the craft and turned around the vehicle. To his dismay however, they stopped the vehicle and got out to get a better look along with the 5-10 other vehicles now lining the shoulder. As they watched, the craft hovered for what seemed like 1-2 minutes and made no sound. Suddenly in an instant it moved about 2 miles South and stopped for a few more seconds before disappearing out of sight toward the Anoka area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object departed, ((name delted)) again begged his sisters to get back into the car and go home. They did and upon entering their house, told their parents the story. After calming ((witness))  down and discussing the object, the eldest sister called the Ramsey Police Department to see if any one had reported the sighting. The dispatcher confirmed that other callers had also reported seeing the unusual craft in the same area during the same time frame.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

And when I was a kid about 15 years old my family lived on the west side of town by an abandond old railroad.Every evening after school a bunch of the neighborhood kids would go inbehind my neighbors utility shed in their back yard to sneak and smoke cigarettes. We were all standing around talking and smoking our cigarettes when one of the boys said look and was pointing up. I looked to where he was pointing and thats when I saw three disk in triangle fomation. These disk were in plain sight and in full daylight. They were perfectly around and chrome or silver in color. They all came to a stop just above our heads and they stoped at the same time just like they were one unit. I watched as they hovered right above us for abuot 5 or 6 minutes and they were close to us just barley clearing the hill tops. They never made a sound just sat in the sky for a few minetes then they all three took off, again as if they were one unit back the way they came over the hill tops. I will nevr forget what I saw and no one can tell me that I was seeing something else other than flying saucers. I don&#39;t call them U.F.O.&#39;S Because I know what they were. As far as I&#39;m concerned they were alien craft from somewhere other than this planet. Nothing can change my mind. I know what I saw and will be willing to take a lie detector test to prove that I&#39;m NOT LYING...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I, my father, and three uncles/cousins were standing out in one of their fields talking about 2 in the afternoon. One of my Uncles suddenly said &#34;what the heck is that&#34; and pointed up to the NW. There was a dark, red cigar shaped object that appeared motionless in the sky. It seemed to be at very high altitude, perhaps spanning an inch at arms length, but I had the impression that it was very large. There was no contrail, no noise, and all agreed that it was no airliner due to the dark red glow.  As we watched, the object suddenly sped off.<n>

I just had finished going to a Sunday school bus meeting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving towards town I noticed off to my right a really shiny object,(like a top) hovering around the Family Life Radio Station tower. It was hovering just about 50-75 feet off the ground.  It was a bright sunny day, and I was first thinking, why would anyone have a weather balloon here. I  thought, why isn&#39;t it moving, because balloons move. This was not moving when I first saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached Tomlinson Road, (the radio station tower was located on that road, maybe about half a mile straight down from Eden Road), I kept watching the object. It was a very bright silver, glistening in the sun.  It had no windows, no lights, nothing except that it was really a bright silver.  It wasn&#39;t moving, just staying still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was listening to that radio station, (WUNN), and I came to the intersection of Eden and Tomlinson. When I got to the intersection, the radio station went completely static so I couldn&#39;t hear it at all.  Then the object started to move and I decided to try to follow it.  It really started to speed up and I know I was doing 60 mph and it just flew off and I couldn&#39;t keep up.  I saw no engine or anything to make it move that fast.  I went home and called the Capital City airport and asked them if they had any reports of an object shaped like a top reported to them. They acted like I was a little nuts, but they said they had nothing reported to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even though it has been about 30 years since I saw it, it is still like it was yesterday, since it was such a strange thing to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

He hurried into the house and beckoned me to view the object from our bedroom window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was massive, spherical, and glowing bright orange.  It was visibly moving downward at a slow pace, and disappeared from view after passing behind trees.  The object would have been between Bailey&#39;s Prairie, TX and Angleton, TX.  My husband and I never drank or used drugs. We have seen the moon glowing orange, but this object was not the moon.  If it had been the moon, the surface textures would have been visible.  The object was glowing much more intensely, with a bright orange light, and had no visible surface features. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The day and time are approximate, but the sighting definitely took place in the mid 1970s, and in the early morning hours (before the sun was up).  The entire sighting lasted approximately five minutes.<n>

I followed the craft by highway, for ten minutes, until in a flash it covered a distance of not less than three miles and was gone!  Wondering what I had just seen, I noticed a returning light on the sky line, and the craft reappeared and slowly faded away in a Westernly direction. Returning home, at what should have been 2:00 am. I find that two hours has elapsed and is totally unaccounted for.  The sighting has affected me very much for the past thirty-one years.  I was the worlds worst skeptic before the sighting.

The object was bobbing around slightly and it surface seemed to be radiating multi-coloured light that was rotating around its perimeter.  The light was of very pure colors of orange, blue, red and white and seemed to be rotating in patches all over its surface.  I stopped to observe it for a few seconds and then began to approach slowly in my vehicle.  I got to within about 60 feet and the object began to rise slightly and move off toward the right side of the street.  It floated behind a tree and between two houses in the direction of the next street over.  I went around the block and once again saw it hovering above the middle of the next street.  This time as I approached slowly, it moved immediately in the same manner and direction without letting me get closer than about 150 feet.  Once again it floated between houses in the direction of the next street.  Again I went around the block and for a third time it was hovering over the middle of the street.  This time I accelerated towards it and it took off like a shot.  I have been present at military live fire trials at night where tracer rounds were being fired and this object moved considerably faster than a bullet.  It was out of sight in a fraction of a second.  I have never seen anything move that fast.  There was no noise or any other affect that I could sense from this object.<n>

I was returning home about midnight driving my VW Beetle.  I turned into the subdivision from a main thoroughfare.  At the first stop sign, I sighted a spherical object about a meter in diameter hovering in the middle of the residential street about a half a block on my left.  I turned left in order to approach the object which was in the center of the road and suspended about 10 feet above the road surface.  I approached slowly and got within 60 feet of the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was bobbing like a cork on the water and was emanating light from its surface.  The light consisted of brilliant colours that seemed to rotate around its surface.  I remember red, blue, orange and yellow patches of light rotating in a random fashion all over its surface.  My impression is that the light was actually photons being emitted by ionized air molecules as the colours were very pure like laser light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I crept slowly forward observing the object through the front windscreen.  When I got within 60 feet the object began to react and drifted with a bobbing motion toward the far side of the road.  It went behind a small tree and between two adjacent houses.  I could see the light being reflected off the aluminum siding of one of the adjacent houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly drove to the end of the block and turned on the side street to go to the next street over to see if it was still visible.  As I turned onto the next parallel street, it was once again hovering in the middle of the road at about the same height.  This time I approached at a little higher speed to see if I could get closer.  The object reacted by once again moving between two adjacent houses in the direction of the third parallel residential street.  I quickly moved around the block to see if it would be in the middle of the third street.  Sure enough it was, once again hovering in the middle of the road.  This time as I rounded the corner it took off at about a 20 degree angle at an astonishing speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have witnessed night time artillery firing trials where the projectile from the artillery piece was a tracer and the speed of this object as it left was much quicker than an artillery round leaving a cannon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard no noise at all during this encounter but of course the engine noise of a VW Beetle is considerable.  However, the departing speed had to be several times the speed of sound and there was no sonic boom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this incident, I and my daughter have both experienced some unexplained night-time events that neither of us can explain but where untraceable blood was found on our pillows and sheets.  These incidents happened at several different residential locations over the course of a couple of decades but have now stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was as if the light was headed the same direction we were.  The light grew 3 or 4 times it size and then would just blink out.... gone and just as quickly would reappear.  It would split and 3 or 4 smaller lights would would sort of fly away from the original light.  They would fly sort of a zig zag pattern ....zip zip... up down.... gone there ... crazy.... no planes fly and disappear and reappear and change colors.... go big and then like a tiny pinprick in the sky...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen other ufo&#39;s in the sky when I have been alone but this time the family saw it.  When we got home to Girard Michigan I ran in the house and called the radio station in Coldwater Michigan.... boy that was a mistake.... they thought I was looney and laughed.... whil I was on the phone my husband and kids stayed outside to observe the light... it was descending on the horizon, grew 6 or 7 times it size.... bright bright... and then just gone...<n> <n><n> <n><n> One time when I was driving very late I saw lights in the sky similar to the above... I was driving cross country on the back roads and there was a car came up behind me and both of us pulled off the road to watch this.... there was a man and woman in the other car.... we didn&#39;t speak to one another just watched till the light or craft whatever, was gone... got into our cars and drove away.... I later thought it was really dumb of me to pull off the road at that time of the night alone.. but at the time I just didn&#39;t feel any fear....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have seen them .... don&#39;t know what they are.... but have seen too many of them to not believe that there is something .... out there... up there... whatever.. thank you for this site.... by the way I am not a kook...

The day was sunny with white cumulus clouds in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking along the base alone I noticed a shadow pass over me.  I looked up expecting to see a cloud.  Instead there was this large black triangular craft silently moving overhead very slowly.  It wasn&#39;t very high above the trees and I looked for identifiable markings but saw none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was familiar with most military aircraft but couldn&#39;t identify it so I thought maybe it was the SR 71 Blackbird which was still relatively secret.  My thought then was it couldn&#39;t be the Blackbird because it was as big as a B-52 and completely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, it ascended straight up without pointing the nose of the aircraft up and disappeared in the clouds in an instant without any noise.  I&#39;ve seen many aircraft flying at top speed including the F-4 Phantom during combat in Vietnam and this craft was much, much faster than any other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t report it because I had about 2 weeks left on my tour before going home and I thought I had just witnessed something I wasn&#39;t supposed to see.  I didn&#39;t want anything to delay my departure so I kept silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

We pulled over and joined the group to stare amazingly at the aircraft.  It was about 3-400&#39; feet long, shaped like the Goodyear Blimp, was hovering motionless with no sound (no engines could be seen anywhere on the craft), and it had brilliant multicolored lights from top to bottom.  The lights were going on and off, moving in a clock-wise pulsating fashion from end to end.  Truly an amazing sight.  After staring for about 5 minutes the craft, without a whisper of any sound, shot straight East at a low altitude and disappeared in less than 3 seconds.  We all looked at each other in disbelief, got in our cars and headed North on 1-5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/11/75 22:00|Cassville|WI|Unknown||Sheriff Deputies and Police Officers watched hovering UFO for Hours.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109594.html|38|ndxe197507| Sheriff Deputies and Police Officers watched hovering UFO for Hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time, I was 22 years old and working three jobs; rec-room manager under a local restaurant, psychiatric assistant at the county in-patient facility, and deputy sheriff. All three jobs were in Lancaster, the county seat, but I lived about 18 miles southwest of there in Cassville.  Since I was a Grant County Deputy, I was able to do ride-along shifts with the Cassville Police officers.  Sometimes I rode in uniform and sometimes not, but I always carried my badge and revolver.  These officers worked alone and were glad of the company and, occasionally, were happy to have backup on calls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this particular evening, I was rushed to get into the squad car by the officer yelling at me as I left the door of the house.  He said I should hurry to get a listen to what was happening on the police-band radio.  After we took off, he filled me in. It seems several sheriff deputies and local municipal police officers were at a farm about 15 miles due north of us, near Mount Hope.  They had been there since the afternoon. Word had gotten out on the county dispatch frequency that a UFO was hovering in the farmer&#39;s field, just a few feet off the ground.  The farmer thought maybe it was having some kind of problems and had been watching it for some time before he thought to call the Sheriff&#39;s Office.  He had not seen any crew members, just the craft hovering there.  The SO sent a road deputy to investigate and soon sent the county narcotics sergeant out there, too.  Not because there were any drugs involved, but because he had a lot of expensive, Federally funded, photographi! c equipment and knew how to use it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, officers from other communities in the surrounding area, Prairie du Chien, Bloomington, and Fennimore, went to the farm out of curiosity.  We radioed county dispatch and asked permission to go, too, but were told we were the only car in the west half of the county that wasn&#39;t there, so, we had better stay where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 22:00, when it was good and dark, the two of us were sitting on a road atop the river bluffs, so we could hear the radio calls from the repeater tower in the farm area. Radio traffic was light until one of the officers shouted into his mic, “Hey! Is it moving?! Hey! It is! It&#39;s going up!”  Other officers chimed in, affirming that the UFO was slowly rising from where it had been hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, another officer added, “There it goes!”  Still another officer wanted to know, “What direction is that?”  Someone answered him, “Straight south.”   There we were, sitting &#39;straight south&#39; of that farm.  I was sitting in the front passenger seat and in the silence, turned away from the radio lights to look, absentmindedly, out my window.  I startled at what, at first, looked like bright, red eyes staring back at me.  Only to realize what I was looking at were the aircraft warning lights, halfway up the cable-TV tower about 300 yards away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned back, with a big smile on my face, and started to tell the other officer what a fool I had just been.  At that instant, the entire squad car was bathed in the brightest, white light I had ever seen.  It appeared to emanate from directly overhead. We both sat there, mouths hanging open, in disbelief.  After what seemed like 8-10 seconds, the light went out. We still sat there, wordless.  Then, I said, “Tell, me what you saw!”  He said, “The brightest light I ever saw!”  Neither of us heard anything outside the vehicle, either coming or going.  There was nothing in the sky that we could see.  I had the overwhelming feeling of a need to be back among people and he had no arguments.  We got down off the river bluff and back into town as quickly as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d estimate, from hearing “Straight south” to being bathed in light was only about seven or eight seconds.<n>

My mom, myself,her best friend and her three children were going to the roller skating rink 13 miles from our homes. As we were traveling along the highway there was a bright light that appeard to be coming from all around us....but very intense from the back window. My moms&#39; friend was driving and she was very upset, believing that some &#34;idiot&#34; was driving to close to us.( This stretch of road was usually busy with big trucks)...she then pulled over to let them pass us......but it didn&#39;t end there. The light didn&#39;t go away.....She got out of the car as did the rest of us, to see what was happening. We all saw the object above the car. It appeared to be triangular, the entire underside of it just pure intense white light. If we had all stood on each others sholders, we could have touched it. None of us were afraid( I guess I don&#39;t know why ) It moved so slow, as if it would fall out of the sky at any moment....There was no sound what so ever. Years later we all have talked about this and it hasn&#39;t left my thoughts all these years. When I went to my ten year reunion....I spoke to my friend who had been in the car with us...He also stated that the encounter was something that he never forgot. I want to say that what is so amazing is that none of us can remember what happened after...Did we go roller skating...did we go home....None of us remember....We never checked to see if there was any time loss(as there was not as much information back then about what can happen if such an event occurs.....Several years later there were numerous cow mutilations on local farms.......nothing was investigated , and the police had nothing to say...They treated us like we were all crazy(only saying that they probably had been killed by animals)......I have often thought about going under hypnosis to see if I can remember anything else about what happened or didn&#39;t happen....Was it a UFO?  I can&#39;t answer the question and may never remem! ber anym ore detail.....But this is my story, of what happened that night, that had such a huge impact on all of us. Even though we can&#39;t remember anymore of what happened that night; we still like to talk about it .........and just wonder.<n>

My brother and I as well as two friends (back when we were teenagers) &#34;borrowed&#34; a neighbors row boat for a near midnite cruise around the lake (Maynard&#39;s Lake in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia). It was a beautiful clear summers nite, the water was as smooth as glass and everywhere you looked it was pitch black. You could see silouhetted houses along the shoreline with the streetlights illuminating them from behind. The only lights to be seen were at the far east end of the lake where the plaza was (approxx. 1½ miles). In any event, we decided to head in as we were out for nearly an hour. While heading in maybe 100 feet from the shore, I heard someone say (in what appeared to be a weak and crackly voice) &#34;what the hell are they&#34;. We turned to the east in the direction of the plaza and maybe 500-600 feet away were two huge Orange glowing spheres, perfectly round, one overlapping the other by probably 15-20%. The very bottom of each sphere just barely touched the water&#39;s surface (they were in the middle of the lake)giving the illusion that there were four. In fact, they were two only. (I&#39;m actually getting chills writing this as I remember) Anyway, we were terrified, one guy crying, so we paddled our butts off for shore. Here&#39;s the bizzare part, the balls were glowing brite orange but they didn&#39;t cast off any light, they seemed to glow from within and the spectrum of light never left the globes. After about a minute of paddling, I looked over and they were still there, not moving and completely silent. Then as quickly as it began, it was over, they were gone, not a trace in the sky, no sound, odor, breeze....nothing. The lake returned to the black mirror state it began in. Not much more to it than that but I&#39;d like to finish with this: The afore mentioned story is the gospel truth. I swear on the life of my children it&#39;s true. I&#39;ve since heard of similar sightings in Mexi! co and S outh America (Orange Glowing Balls) And only wish I had continued to look as they dissappeared. None of us saw them leave as we were too busy getting the hell out of there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Report is similar to the celebrated Allagash Sighting case, which occurred in the State of Maine in late August 1975.

I wonder what the hell they were and where were they from?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry Peter but 2 of the three witnesses I have not kept in touch with, the third however is my Brother, Allie.

My parents had to let me fall asleep in the den with them and they would then carry me up to my room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon finally talking to them about what was worrying me their reaction was almost as scary as the original event.  When I spoke of this with them they turned ghostly pale and seemed very stressed- although my mother did manage to muster out that it must have been &#34;just a dream.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night in the summer of&#39;73, I woke to find two small grey beings standing in my bedroom looking at me. (This was before any mention of, or description of, alien abductions had been put on T.V. or in the movies-to my knowledge at that time, anyway.)  The beings could not have been much taller than 4 feet, they had very large almond shaped black eyes, they were slender and their mouths were just slits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the beings walked towards me and spoke to me telepathically. I could not move and I was clearly very fearful. I asked him if he was a Martian and he said, no, but you are right that we are from another planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t remember much that happened after that, but I do remember looking towards the hallway (my door was open and the hall light was on), and I saw my father being carried out by several of the small beings out of the hall and down into the stairwell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other memory of this event- which is slightly detached-is that I remember a different being, slightly larger but with the same large eyes, hovering over me, telling me that they wont hurt me and then forcing me to drink some white liquid that had the appearance of milk but had a horrible chemical taste.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During my subsequent years I think I chose to forget this traumatic experience. But one day when I was in my late teens I was walking past a bookstore and saw a display of Whitley Streiber’s book &#34;Communion.&#34;  When I saw that  face on the cover of the book I went into a cold sweat and had a panic attack.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took several months to get up the courage to purchase that book and read it. These memories then came back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not pursued hypnotherapy to reveal any further truths, simply because I really don’t think I want to know-not yet anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear to you that this really did happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My sister and I saw this one evening while I was baby sitting her when my parents where working that evening.  I&#39;m a bit worried because I reported this when we saw it, and was warned off saying anything else about the event.  Being quite young I of course followed orders - I was somewhat scared of these people.  However, I recently moved elsewhere in the UK and in this area there was a UFO flap during January -March.  I saw a couple of the light shows recently, and called the local coastal radar station to ask what these low flying lights might be, and through the phone call had a visit from the MOD. It seems I&#39;m on file even after all this time, and I do not like the idea of being considered public property by certain government departments. I wouldn&#39;t mind so much if I had led an unusual or eventful life, but I&#39;m just a middle aged house wife who seems to have a file with the government? We were sat in the living room of my mothers home which has windows over looking both the rear and front gardens.  I&#39;m sure of the time because we had just finished watching a TV program that finished at 8.30.  My sister saw a strange light in the back that she described as like a glittering ball of light a bit bigger than a tennis ball.  She saw this in our neighbours garden and it seemed to be hopping around the plants and hedges.  (I got the full description after the event I am about to relate.) My sister told me she&#39;d seen something odd in our neighbours garden, and she thought that perhaps his hedge was on fire.  I got up to go to the window to take a closer look, and i couldn&#39;t see what she had seen, but as we stood together a huge cluster of lights descended from the sky towards us. The lights were a blue/green in colour and looked like a cross section of a craft.  The lights came towards us a tremendous speed. We ran from the house thinking some kind of aircraft was about to crash on us, and as we stood on the front path wondering why we were still alive a black triangular shaped craft covered in a multitude of different coloured lights flew slowy over us.  If there had been enough room for it to land I&#39;m sure it would have done.  In the meantime a commercial aircraft heading towards Manchester International Airport came into view and the craft took off after it and seemed to be playing tag with it all the way to the airprort.<n>

7/7/75 19:00|Fort Washakie|WY|Light|20 seconds|lights that appear to be stars, blending in with the night stars|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68724.html|46|ndxe197507| lights that appear to be stars, blending in with the night stars<n> <n><n> <n><n> I recently heard your program on coast to coast, 2-16-09, I would like to briefly give you some back ground information of where I live, I was born and raised in west central Wyoming at the foot of the wind river mountains, putting me on the east side of the rocky mountains in WY very sparsely populated. I personally believe that &#34;whatever&#34; or &#34;whoever&#34; is controlling these &#34;objects&#34;, &#34;lights&#34; I have seen most of these at night and two shiny objects in the day time, that glimmered for a few seconds and disappeared. That they can operate in relative anonymity because of the back drop of the mountains coupled with no population towards the west and into the rocky mountains until you reach the very western portion of WY and encounter sparse populations again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never written or reported what I am about to describe as my experiences, I have only talked about this with close friends or family members, some of them have seen what I have seen. I am compelled to write about these experiences, for some of them I have never heard or read about anywhere, but may have been reported to this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the mid 1970&#39;s, when I was around 13 yrs old, I was walking home from a friends house at night after sunset, getting dark. I was startled to see about a mile away a bright white light, that did not light up the surrounding area and had the luminosity of that of a star, rise and fall behind a hill in a circular motion, this happened in a couple of seconds. I was in shock when I got home and wondered about what I had seen for days (it was at this point I became open minded about reading of UFO sightings and all the strange stories that came with UFO sightings, abductions, contacts. etc...).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was around 17, I was coming home from work, traveling in westerly direction towards home about a mile away (my home is at 6,200 ft, foothills, traveling up the switch backs for another ½  mile you can be at 12,000 ft ), it was getting dark, something was just not right for a few seconds in the sky when I noticed that a star was bigger than any star should be was in the sky, if it was not for its size I probably would not have noticed. This star slowly fell from the sky and into a canyon, the walls on the canyon were turning different colors red, green, blue as this light fell into the canyon. For weeks and months I scanned the skies to see if I could see anything similar I became aware of the stars, planets, planes and satellites and always kept glancing at the night sky to see anything out of the ordinary I seen none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In my late 30&#39;s I was at my parents home, in the living room watching TV, the TV was in the corner and next to the TV was a large picture window that faced in an easterly direction. I seen what appeared to be a shooting star that fell from a north to south direction. It streaked across the sky, burned out. But then reappeared and was bobbing up and down in the air and slowly stopped, it then moved slowly across the hills in a southerly direction and was turning different colors of red, green and blue, until it disappeared from sight about 15 to 20 seconds and about 100 to 200 feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also around this same time (months) I was walking my infant son back and forth in my trailer and when passing a small window I seen a bright white light (star) that was traveling horizontally in a westerly direction towards the mountains, before it reached the mountains it went out. The next day and this was in the middle of July the face of the mountain in a circular pattern looked like it was covered in light snow in the area of where I seen the light. My mother had seen this as she was washing dishes, we planned to go to the side of the mountain to see what this was, but it rained within a couple of hours and this light white snow looking stuff was gone, this was about 10 am in the morning. My wife, older son, brother in law and nephews all seen this and could only wonder what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another strange deal is what I have thought to be satellites. In the early 90&#39;s I, my wife, nephew and cousin were lighting fire works I had a flashlight to see the fuses when they were lit. I noticed what appeared to be a satellite that was moving through the sky and told everyone look there is a satellite moving in the sky. My wife said where, I pointed with the flashlight &#34;on&#34;, at the satellite. My wife seen it moving along with my nephew right as I pointed the light at it and we all seen it stop and remain motionless and became a fixture as part of the stars. Needless to say I have had the same experiences on a couple of other occasions with these so called satellites that stop in the sky once they are noticed (weird).<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The car was facing south.  It was a clear day with no clouds and no rain coming from the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An object appeared in the horizon from the west and moved rapidly across the sky toward the east and south.  The object briefly hesitated about 3/4 way across the horizon and appeared to move more southward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a bright blue sphere that appeared almost transparent but also seemed to emanate light.  By size comparison, the object appeared to be the size of a full, harvest moon.  It is very difficult to determine the distance from the car to the object, but estimates are about 3 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers were a male professional bank auditor; a female college student working for an environmental consulting firm and a professional chemist and quality auditor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The female student reported this incident at her workplace and discussed it with the firm&#39;s meteorologist.  It was the meteorologists opinion that the object was a plasma ball or ball lightening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The female thought this not to be likely as the object appeared to be quite perfect and manufactured rather than a spontaneous natural occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My interest in reporting this sighting is to find out if there are any other individuals who witnessed this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The park had tall trees. Then the sun was blocked off, like a cloud had passed over head. We looked up, because it was a clear sunny day, with no clouds. We saw large sphers over the top of us. They were blocking the sun. My wife said, go get the camera. I ran to the car to get the camera. I turned and looked up to see the sphers, which had a light gray bottom, move to the north, out over Lake Ontario. They stoped at the edge of the lake. The bottoms changed color to the same color of the lake, light blue. there were 7 of them about 200&#39; to 300&#39; in Dia. They were in a formation that they kept when they moved. Two in front, with 3 behind and 2 to the right side ot the formation. As I was trying to take a photo, they moved at a very very high speed straight out over the water. I would say they were no more then 150&#39; above the water. Then the sphere that was at the right rear moved at a 90 degree angle and went East along the lake shore. They main groop went straught north out over the lake. They were moving at a very high rate of speed and was gone in a second. They made no sound and had no lights on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never reported this to anyone before. I watched the newspapers to see if anyone had reported this incounter. My wife and I decided not to say anything to any law inforcement agency as they would not beleive us. Years later I was in a book store and picked up a book on UFOs. In the book there was a photo of 7 spheres in the formation I and several other people had seen back on that 4th of July 1975<n>

Lights on bottom, flying low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 10-11 years old playing in the front yard with some friends.  I don&#39;t rememebr how my attention was drawn to the sky, probably by someone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and observed a low flying craft approx. 1000-2000 feet up.  It was large but I only vaguely remember the outline being circular or oval in shape.  What drew my attention was a circular formation of lights underneath alternating colors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not recall any other lights on the object.  Our house was just 5 miles north of Richards-Gebauer Airbase so seeing aircraft was common all times of day and night. This would have been about the time that the base was slated for closing but the military traffic continued well past from when I moved from the neighborhood several years later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving roughly from the northwest to the south east.  I rememebr someone saying &#34;Looks like the UFOs are landing.&#34;  I totally freaked and went inside the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the last I saw and I never talked about it over the years.  I had convinced my self that it was something normal, possibly a blimp.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just recently I contacted my brother and asked him if he remembered the event and asked about the detatils just so I coudl verify that I had not missed soemthing after I went inside.  He related that he did remember, he would have been about 12-14 at the time.  He remembered the object as silvery with lights on the bottom but no other lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was low and he and other(s) (Unknown who the other kids were) went in the backyard as it went over the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He remembers the object turning to the North and he watched it until it was out of sight.  He distinctly remembers thinking that the object definitely was not an aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> pointed out the possibility of a blimp and we both agreed that that we had never seen a blimp in the area before (Especially due to the presence of the airbase) and we were very familiar with the aircraft that frequented the base since we alsways tried to identify the aircraft by the sound they made as they approached for a landing. This object made no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up, when I heard a very distant swooosh sound and saw a greyish triangular object had Burst through the clouds and had caused a trail of cloud to follow it as it went downwards and then did a U turn up-wards and dissapeared back into the clouds. Myself and my friends saw this and when I said &#34;what is it&#34; one of my friends very casually said &#34;Oh! It&#39;s only a UFO&#34;. This has played on my mind for all these years and I thought I would share it with you, To see if anyone else has seen similar or in fact if anyone else from Hull England may have seen the same thing on the same evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Appeared over Lake Menominee, near Baysville, Ontario.  I was washing dishes.  I turned to look around.  Hovering at about my eye level over the lake was an orange something.  I dropped everything and went to look out the window to see what it was.  No noise at all.  I watched.  It moved slowly down to the end of the lake then shot up completely out of my sight.  Still no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like a cup turned upside down on a saucer.  It was not very big.  My guess is that it might have been about 50 feet in diameter.  There appeared to be 6 lights around the edge of the saucer.  They were not flashing and did not appear to be on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No neighbours saw it.  Just me.  It is as clear in my memory today as it was when I saw it.  Never heard of any other sightings in that area.<n>

I went with the family next door to a lake just north of Toronto for a day of swimming.  The family consisted of a Mother, Father and two daughters.  I remember the car was a &#34;Duster&#34;. The incident happened on the way home.  There was some discussion between the parents whether or not to look for the object they had seen.  (I think one wanted to and the other did not.  Us kids really weren&#39;t paying attention yet.) We found the &#34;ship&#34; on the front yard to a farmhouse.  It had, I believe, 4 legs that were quite long (2 or 3 metres) with a sphere on top.  It was grey/metallic in colour.  The door/hatch was in the shape of (what looked like to me) a lions head. I saw the hatch start to open and the family start to get out.  The next thing I knew we were driving down the highway, singing to the radio as if nothing had happened. I always used to think of this a &#34;my encounter&#34;.  But since learning more about the phenomena of ufos (through programs such as Jeff Rense and reading Missing Time by Budd Hopkins) I now suspect that a member of the family I was with was/is an abductee and that I was simply &#34;switched off&#34;.  I don&#39;t know how much time is missing -- I was just a kid -- but it seemed to me at least an hour or two darker after the encounter than just before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My Aunt who is now deceaced had kept a journal of numerous sightings she and others had exerienced for many years at the resort during the 70&#39;s. I had a freind that was in the same jr high class that was very interested in ufo&#39;s and when I mentioned an upcomming family event taking place at the resort and the fact that ufo&#39;s were sighted often he asked to be invited along. I only mention these facts at all because this individual happens to now be one of the worlds experts on ufo&#39;s. Since no names are to mentioned here, I think it&#39;s safe to say that if it comes a time for documenting this report his eye witness testimony would be invaluable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway on the day in question he and I spent the day scouting places where the craft had been seen to land.  On one spot the craft had set down and started a wild fire and when fire personel gathered on the ridge across from resort the craft landed back on the western ridge just north of the resort and sat and watched the fire being put out.  We examined both sites and the western ridge had three deep indentations that had apparently melted the soil into an almost glassy looking substance similar to black glass. There was no brush in this area because it was a fire break and a clearing and it why I beleive we were able to spot the landing site and melted soil. We were told that it was about time to go so my freind and I asked my uncle if we could get on the roof of the chalet to get a good vantage point to scan above the tree tops before we left and he showed us how to get up there and told time was almost up and watch the guide wires supporting the antenna. My freind had an old camera ! that you had to look down to view the object you were shooting and he took it out of it&#39;s case and just then I heard a low humming almost a vibration comming from the high western ridge that runs about a mile away rrom the resort.At this point we were about 40-50 feet above ground level and my mother and aunt were just comming out the front door calling for us to come on down to go. As the humming got louder I focused my attention in that direction and saw what appeared to be a structure, like stuts but viewable through its body. I called out to my freind and said &#34;This has got to be it&#34;. Ashe looked were I was pointing he said he wasnt seeing anything, But as it got closer it began to fill in and turn a purplish color and filled out into a long cigar shaped craft. We both watched in awe as this object the size of a football field matterialized and just stopped right at eye level about 30-40 feet away and at about 50-60 feet above the ground. The craft hovered about 45 seconds and my freind attempted to spap a picture but tripped over a wire and as he got back up and tried again the craft zipped away at a speed I cannot desribe. Back on the ground everyone that had seen the craft desribed what they saw and my mothers desription gave it a black stripe right down the middle that was not observed from our vantage point on the roof. After this event I questioned my Aunt for more info on her sightings and experences and she told me it had been visiting for years and she had even reported it to the Air Force and after several meetings with them she was told to keep here mouth shut and she was crazy. Well she was not crazy and 33 years later I can still see it like it was yesterday. My friend as stated earlier was so impressed by the experience he made it his lifes passion and ocupation. There were other strange things that happened to me soon after and later in life. The craft appeared to follow us home {Fremont Cal} and I experienced lost time and knowledge of their propulsion systeem and motivations for their visita! tions. I cant explain this knoledge, but I do know that after discusing the propulsion ststem with my uncle {not related to this incident} that worked at California Berkley about the method of propulsion he asked how I could have such knowledge about such far away and cutting edge information. Anyway thats about it in a nutshell and if I could speak to someone with the right forum or willing to explore this deeper I believe that a lot of things can be unlocked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

They remained in sight for approx 12 seconds. I would estimate they were 3 to 5 miles from my location.

I was riding &#39;shotgun&#39; and the bass player was driving the bus across the Utah desert. The land was very flat. Approximately 3am I saw a light streak from left to right across the horizon. Through the large bus window it was a spectacular sight. I said nothing and the time. About 10 minutes later the driver said, &#34;did you see that?&#34; and I said, &#34;what was that?&#34; He said, &#34;I don&#39;t know but there ain&#39;t no planes that can go that fast.&#34; We never talked about it again but I have recounted the story many times over the past 29 years. It was not a shooting star because it was going horizontal. Shooting stars fall. This was not going down it was going left to right across the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
