(My home is located near a small airport, berz-macomb.) When i first saw the object i realized that it could not be a plane or a helicopter, due to the size of the light. From my view the light was as big as if i was extending my arm and looking at the tip of my pinky finger. It was a constant bright white light, with no other lights around it. After watching it proceed from left to right on my view of the sky, it suddenly changed course and dissapeared rather quickly into the horizon.<n>

He is still in shock.  The most important factor is that he has this on video camera.  We have seen the event and it is real.  Our friend was sleeping and had a bright light in his living room wake him up.  His house was shaking.  He looked out and saw a round, mushroom shaped craft.  It was white, with green , red, blue and black in the center.  He felt the center had a hole in it.  The object was shaking his house and he held the camera and filmed it while it was in his neighborhood.  He filmed it as it flew up and away.  Amazing!  He is now in the process of making copies and doesn&#39;t know what to do next.  I looked on this list and saw that several other people in the same town our friend lives in have seen this exact, or a similar object.  We have it on tape and will proceed with showing it to someone soon.  Thanks!<n>

My back yard is quite big (80 meters long) and we cannot see the back wall from our window unless it is a very bright night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I waited for him in bed and paid attention to what was happening. He stayed at the window for about half an hour and I noticed that it was dark again and the birds had gone quiet and the dogs stopped running and barking. He went back to bed and told me what he had seen: our dogs were barking to the back of the yard, sniffing around the trees tracking something and our doberman was barking to the top of the wall. He looked up ready to take his gun to make some noise, for he thought someone was trying to invade our property. Then he looked up and saw there was a &#34;person&#34; standing still on the top of the wall. As he said he thought it was a person but our wall is about 2.5 meters high (+- 8 ft)and the person was as tall as the wall. He got so astonished that all he could do was stare. He said the person might have noticed being observed and walked very lightly to the corner of the wall and did not jump, just walked off the wall as if walking off the stairs in a house. Right after that, he said, it went dark again like someone turned off the light ( I noticed that too ). In the morning he talked to some of his friends (military) who later confirmed (unofficially, of course) that several people, including military people, reported the unusual brightness of the sky from different points of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date apparently is approximate.

We were one block from the beach and although cold and damp and very dark we decided to walk to the beach to look at the ocean and stars before our two hour trip back to Wilmington.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were enjoying the sounds of the waves and looking up to the stars on a very clear evening we were startled by an immense triangle shaped craft moving in our direction off of the ocean moving east to west at a moderate speed. The flat platform type craft moved directly over our heads and we stood in complete amazement.  There was absolutely no sound coming from above and a pin point light was at the tips of each corner. The size of the Dark craft blocked out the stars on a very large scale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seemed very large but as we were watching we couldn&#39;t determine how high off the ground it was.  We watched the mysterious craft continue on over the small city and disapear in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We discussed our experience and due to the fact that we were one hour south of Dover Air Force Base and in the middle of a war we reluctantly decided that it was some sort of very large experimental aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We researched what we saw to some extent and have never been able to get the image out of our minds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then this evening while watching the special put forth by ABC news we realized that so many others have seen this same unexplainable craft across the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I are family oriented people who live clean and healthy lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We know what we saw and would like to find out if any one else in our area saw the same that evening??<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Anyway, i put the trash away then walk back to the pourch before lookin up to see if i was right.  Sure eought, bright star, moving slowly, i watched it for at least 30 sec. plus the time i was walking. As i watched it move, it did what they always do, faded slowly and was gone.

Noticed in distance where the electrical conduit at the end of Bryn-Zion Rd, on Underwoods Rd there was bright light. Thought that was strange I never noticed the electrical tower had lights before. As I drove about 30 seconds, noticed lights coming closer. Thought that it was flying very low for airplane. It was traveling slower than plane, almost hovering it moved so slow for an airplane. Only the speed of a car. It was the size of a plane with two big very bright lights in front, one in back, so gave appearance of being triangle, but even as it intersected and flew over me on route 300, I could see no details of the actual craft. Even though it was so low, that had it been flying toward me, rather than cross ways, I think the passengers could have seen right in my car. I actually ducked in my car as it flew over, as a reflex. I had no radio on and my driver&#39;s side window was slightly down and still I heard no noise. The lights were very bright but not searching, they were straight like headlights on each end of the front of the craft. It flew right over top of me and continued on over field in direction of Air Base. There we 2 cars behind me in the distance, maybe 2 miles. So I know they would have seen this low flying aircraft. It would have caught their attention if for no other reason than it was flying extremely low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The witness holds a position of considerable responsibility, and we presume that the party is a quite credible source.

I was looking toward the west off and on. Having looked down momentarily, then back up, I saw a bright light in the distance. Thinking it was a star, I said to myself, &#34;this is the first star tonight, I&#39;ll make a wish&#34;. I looked down to pick up something for a second time, then looking back, the single star was gone and was replaced by two star-like objects, side by side, about 5 inches apart at arms length. I alerted my girlfriend as they suddenly faded out. Above these lights all the while was a slow moving jet,leaving a contrail. In about ten minutes, we were startled to see a small BLACK single engine plane appear out of nowhere, headed southeasterly from Keesler AFB. Our apartment is about 2 miles east of the base in Biloxi, Ms. This is my first UFO sighting, but hopefully not my last.<n>

Something caught my friends eye and for the next few minutes our attention was drawn to an increasing number of brown specks in the sky. There were four in total, emerging one by one on the horizon in front of us. They all moved in a straight path towards the opposite horizon, so we had a significant amount of time to observe them. They had an irregular, angular shape though the specifics are vague because they were so far away. Although they  all seemed predominantly brown, there were areas within each aircraft which were of a different colour. These smaller specks seemed to change appearance as the aircraft moved, as if there was something glowing or &#39;bulging&#39; beneath each one. Their colour would shift through different shades of brown and even to black at times, while the basic angular shell of each craft remained completely unchanged. The craft made no sound. At one point, a regular aeroplane passe! d by so that we were able to compare the massive difference between it and the unusual objects we were seeing. The final object to pass seemed to get smaller before it passed from our view. All three observers are students, and were relatively clear-headed despite the time of the week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, who telephoned from the U.K., and he sounded to be quite serious-minded and credible.  We would welcome other reports from anyone who might have been witness to the same event.  The sighting occurred at 7:30 a.m., we believe the caller asserted.  PD))<n>

I couldn&#39;t help but notice this bright orange object moving from north to west over the western horizon.  I beleive the color was orange because of the sunset reflecting off the object.  I thought it was a shooting star but it moved to slow.  Possibly an airplane?  It didn&#39;t fly like one.  I seemed like it took forever to cross the sky but then it was gone in a flash.  I took several photos of the object.  About an hour after sunset, I was out walking my dog and had this strange feeling I was being watched.  I looked directly up and saw a silver (kind of a mercury) bright light directly above me it looked like it was next to an airplane that was passing overhead.  The object sat there for a minute then it took off stright out of the sky.  It was as if some had just turned off light.  For some reason, my gut tells me that this was the same object I saw an hour oh so earlier.  I also believe there is a pilot or two out there that saw this thing.<n>

My husband and I were headed out to our cattle lot to unload a semi load of cattle and I witnessed it out of my passenger side window. My husband did not look in time to see it.  He tried to reassure me that it was probably a meteor or something, but as far as I know they do not shoot up from above the tree line into the sky. It was then that I became a little scared to be out in the dark close to the place where it looked to have come from.<n>

Our back yard ends about 50-60 feet at the edge of a mostly pine forest.  A light through a small gap in the trees caught my eye.  I got my 16X binoculars and went on the back porch to sit on a couch and brace my hands against a small ledge that runs under the windows to get a steady view.  When I focused on the light, I suddenly gasped at what I saw.  I saw a bright white light with four smaller, dimmer white lights around it that would form a perfect plus sign if an imaginary line were drawn between them through the larger light.  I believe I could barely make out an outline of an isosceles triangle, with the base about 60-70% of the length of the sides.  The corners were rounded.  This light configuration was toward the base of the triangle, centered along the centerline.  There was also another bright light, a little dimmer and smaller, along the centerline toward the point of the triangle.  I also believe I could barely make out a dim red glow in the center of the triangle.  I looked at the moon and it was out of focus.  I adjusted the focus one way and the moon came in.  I refocused on the object, and had to focus the other direction to bring the trees into focus.  This told me it was not a star I was seeing, but something between the trees and moon.  I went out the front door and across the street to see if I could see it above the trees, but I saw nothing.  After a few minutes I went back to the porch and all I could see was a star that was not as bright and in a slightly different location.  About a half mile through the woods in that direction is David L. Rainer Elementary School.  I would estimate the object was about 1000-1500 feet over the school.  Despite this &#34;sighting&#34;, I still want to see one up close, where it is unmistakeable, for me to say for sure there are UFOs.  By the way, I was completely sober.<n>

We stopped at a neighbor&#39;s vacant house that they&#39;re remodeling to see the progress.

It was out over the sea.  But I&#39;ve never seen anything like this.  It traveled too fast for a plane, too slow for a meteor (shooting star), and seemed bright and fuzzy around the edges, a bit orange colored.  I have no idea what it is but wanted to ask someone if they could enlighten me.  I thought perhaps a sattelite but I&#39;ve never seen one that looked like it was going to land.  Thank you.<n>

I called my son out to the front yard to see it. Although it hadn&#39;t travelled far it started to dim quickly. He came out, looked, i said its dimming, he said no there it is and pointed, but pointed above where my craft was. my craft disappeared and i saw what he saw.

We looked up and at first I thought it was a bright satellite, as bright or brighter than Sirius. It did not change in instensity though and travelled in a east to north east direction. At a couple of points you could see a very thin faint white trail comming from it so I kewn it was not a satellite and was too slow to be a meteor and was not a jet.

I hold a BA in Human Relations and female 47yrs, the other 2 witnesses who with me walked to another part of the yard to keep the objects in view were male about 40 and 50 yrs of age, I&#39;m not sure of their backgrounds. The first object we believe was a plane with the usual red/green blinking lights, heading east to west, following that was a white light moving about the same speed, not fast but steady, but with no blinking lights . One of the other eye witness made the observation that it was much too close to the first object to be a plane because they&#39;re  not allowed to fly so near each other. The third object was the same short distance following the 2nd object and was also a white light with no blinking lights.We watched untill they were out of our view due to trees blocking the sky. There was no sound heard<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The sighting cannot be ascribed to the International Space Station, which had passed over the New York City area approximately 15-20 minutes earlier.

Pres. Bush was in town that day for a fund-raising dinner. I live approx. 10 miles due east of Sky Harbor Intl. Airport. Air Force One had taken off to the west and we were watching it climb as it swung around to the east. I had called my wife outside to watch it with us. Shortly after Air Force One went out of site, I noticed a dark shape that appeared to be drifting across the sky. At first, I thought it was a black or dark-colored party balloon. Then we noticed it was larger than a balloon and was not drifting, but seemed to be moving under its own power. The shape was oblong, like two spheres joined together. There was no observeable texture to the surface or any reflections. I estimate the size at 8 to 10 feet long, and 2 to 3 feet tall. It appeared to be at about 300 to 500 feet in altitude and moved steadily at approx. 50 mph. It made no sound as it flew in a straight line to the southeast. The altitude and speed never seemed to vary. The craft would have passed almost directly over the downtown Mesa area during rush hour and would have been easily observed by hundreds, if not thousands, of people (if they cared to look up). There were other aircraft in the area, as we are directly under the glide path for planes landing at Sky Harbor. Airliners pass over our house every 20-30 seconds at that time of day. I&#39;m interested to see if anyone else observed this craft at that time.<n>

We stopped off at the town of Grindelwald to sight-see.  I had my zoom binoculars (7 - 21 X 50) with me and started to look at the local mountains from the coach parking area.   One mountain which was due south of us (I also had my compass with me) had a particularly pointed shape with left and right slopes of about 45 degrees.   Over this peak I saw a spherical shaped object which I thought  must be some sort of symbol erected on a mast at the peak of the mountain, but after a few seconds observation I realised there was no mast.   The object looked aluminum in color and was illuminated by the sun.   Without the binoculars I had great difficulty in finding the object, but could just about see it with the naked eye.   Over the period of 5 minutes it moved to the right very slowly and eventually disappeared behind another mountain mass.   Another person in our party also had a pair of binoculars and was able to observe the same object.   I later tried to work out the angular diameter of the object and I estimated it to be not more than 3 mins of arc.   Being a stranger to the area I could not tell how far away the mountain was but using estimates of say 4 miles distance this would place the diameter of the object at about 18 feet.<n>

I am not one to believe in UFO&#39;s or anything, but now I can&#39;t deny what I saw. It was not of this world, or maybe it was the government testing something, either way it was strange and there wasn&#39;t a logical explanation of what I saw.  Suddenly, one shot straight up into the air and looked like something going into space. but it didn&#39;t, it flew right over our heads and appeared to look like a triangle. It immediately changed directions, nothing that I know of can go at that speed and change from right to left so quickly. The other lights were still there, they had an orange glow to them.

The object, consisting of four or five rectangles connected with what might be described as a rigid filament (the filament extended out past the line of rectangles on both ends, as well) drifted across the field of view rather slowly, moving roughly toward the zenith.  It was approximatly one degree in apparent length and did not appear to be outside the atmosphere.  Detail of some kind was clearly visible on all the rectangles, but I have no opinion as to what it was.  The object moved at about the rate an aircraft cossing the field of view would have moved, rather than a satellite, so I ruled out space debris.  There was no weather ballon at either end of the series of rectangles visible, and, although my first impression on spotting it was that it was some sort of space station, the size of the object and its slow speed would, of course, rule that out as a possibility.  The sunset was recent enough to have provided illumination to the object, so I cannot conclude it had any illunation of its own.  I would be interested to find out if there is a well-known object that fits the description of what I observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks very much for your prompt response.  I, like you, am totally puzzled by the object, and despite my request for anonymity, please feel free to give my email address or phone number to anyone with professional credentials who might like to talk about it.  One technical point about the equipment that<n> <n><n> might not be immediately obvious (the Stellacam EX is relatively new) is that the setting of the camera at the time (sense up to 128, which means that 128 1/60 second exposures are cumulated on board the camera and output to the monitor every two seconds as one image) means that the object had to be quite dim.  At 128 a planet or aircraft would bleed badly into adjacent pixels, but this object did not bleed at all.  (128, for example, is so sensitive that stars within a globular cluster bleed into each other and the cluster appears to be one star.)  Since the object did not appear burned out in any way, it<n> <n><n> might actually have been too dim for, say, an 8&#34; SCT to observe at all and I don&#39;t see any way that binoculars could have picked it up.  But I still remain astonished at its apparent large size and slow speed.  I suppose the most obvious explanation is that it was some sort of attachment to a weather<n> <n><n> device or other man-made device of which the general public is not aware, and had I seen a balloon attached to it, I&#39;d have little doubt about that supposition.  But I didn&#39;t and, I cannot really account for its apparent direction of movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END COMMENT))<n>

Conditions were very bright and clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all out on our roof garden enjoying the great weather and my girlfriend, who was lying on her back sunbathing, suddenly pointed straight up and said &#34;whats that up there?&#34;  At first my friend and I couldnt really see anything obvious and this wasnt helped by the brightness of the sky or the fact that we didnt know what we were looking for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However within a few seconds of scanning the area my partner was indicating, we managed to spot what had captured her attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be a small shiny silvery-white sphere, just hanging there above us - it was impossible really to say if they were very small or very high, but they were probably at least a few thousand feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few seconds of spotting this sphere i noticed another one, and then another and then more. They were all in the same area of the sky and i think there were between 7-9 altogether, either just hanging there or moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought they might be birds but their movement was not consistent with this idea, no circling or anything - just stationary or drifting very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood watching them, over a period of 4-5 mins they gradually moved into a &#39;V&#39; formation directly above us and stayed stationary in this position for several minutes - we realised then for sure that they couldnt have been balloons either and this was something out of the ordinary. We became quite excited at this point and i ran indoors to get my camera and our friend dashed of to his car to get his binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, by the time we got back the spheres had begun to break formation and drift apart. Looking through the binoculars didnt show any further detail,  but we could definitely see that they were solid objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I put my 70-210mm telephoto lens on my SLR and snapped off a few pictures, one at around 70mm showing 3 of the spheres in the frame and another at 210mm showing just one. I have enclosed scans of the prints.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon enlarging the scan of the 210mm zoomed picture a little more detail became evident, showing in fact the object is not a sphere but more teardrop or shell shaped. It also seems to show a small trail or maybe a puff of gas venting  ?  Anyway, as we continued watching they all just moved off very slowly in different directions until they were out of sight. I&#39;d say the total duration of the sighting was approx 10-15 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately after later finishing off the roll of film i mislaid it and it didnt turn up again until a few weeks ago, which is why this report is so overdue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best Regards<n>

First I think that this was human craft but when I turn my binocular(20X60) towards the object under the magnification I saw white object looking just like phase of Moon or Venus or like little hook .<n> <n><n> At the moment I start our UFO-ALERT and take out all my optical arsenal , I telephone to few of the members but find only one of them and he was informed about the situation . The observation was hard because there are big clouds and for 25 minutes I was abble to see the UFO only for few seconds time . I try to fix it with 50Xpower spotting scope installed on a tripod  but without any result . At 15:20 so many dark clouds enter all the sky that it was inpossible to watch the UFO and we stop the observation .<n> <n><n> There are no witnesses for this sighting ,the other member failed to track the UFO . This was my third UFO observation in my life but this type of UFO I saw for first time . Before I read about hook-looking UFOs in russian UFO webs . Here in Sofia we(few amateur-astromers) have UFO-ALERT system about situations like this today .<n>

It was also noted that the object had no external lights, but appeared to be illuminated from within, not flickering, but a solid steady light. The size of the object was thought to be about the size of an automobile. My wife also stated that the object was flying so slow as to almost appear to be hovering but was clearly moving from west to east across the sky, the object had no sound whatever, but both witnesses believe that the object seemed to be powered as even a balloon floating with the slight breeze that night, would have drifted quicker than this object. Both witnesses were very insistent as there are many blimps in this area, that this was not an airship, as by law they have navigational and blinking becons and are loud. Both insisted this was something strange and feel that it was definately not a balloon of any sorts or other conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I turned at the Unemployment Office and headed toward Hwy 72.  I crossed over the R.R. Trax and their is a good size field to the left. I always look to see the horses, but this time, I cought something out of the corner of my left eye.  I WATCHED as a Big Blur, flew right across my field of view and over the trees to my right. By the time I made it to the next clearing to my right, it was gone out of sight. It was maybe a few hundred feet from me, It was Aprox. 500&#39; to 1000&#39; from the ground. It was a hand and a halftall at arms lenght. It was as long or longer than my arm, held at arms lenght. It looked almost like, when you scramble someones face on tv, the blur you see. It was moving sooo fast! It took maybe 2to3 seconds for it to, with my head turned to the left then following it, go all the way across in front of me and over the trees to the right. Nothing can move that fast. But that did! I did not see any shape in the blur what so ever. It looked transparent as such. no color. Like what you would see if you hold someones very thick glasses up to the sky and look through one lens at a cloud. Just a blur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I would compare it to watching a kite dive at the ground, this moved extremely fast. I had the impression it was large and had a blue-white light in the center with two elipses illuminated at either end, it seemed to have a possible cigar shape to it. While making it&#39;s dive and turn it just faded quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event lasted between 3-4 seconds, I was stunned at the speed this object moved at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not positive on this time frame because I hesitated to report this but I am quite certain that what I saw was out of the ordinary and also similar to another California report for September.<n>

I stared at them and asked my kids if they were seeing what I was seeing and they told me yes.  As we got in the van and I started to drive the ufo started moving in our direction.  My kids were just starring at it and it had a lot of lights.  It was just moving along next to us but in the sky.  Suddenly it past us and then it went side ways and headed back towards us and there it was next to us again.  No sound ever came out of it like an airplane or helicopter.  It was silent with little movement.  As we got to Burger King it disappeared.  When we got home I asked the kids to draw what they had seen and the drew a plate like image with lights on it.  No one beliefs us.<n>

A light straight ahead of me at about 30 degrees (it was small about half the size of a pencil erassor if you hold it in front of you) I am guessing it was pretty far away. It was white but got bright and then went dim to the point of not seeing it in the sky and then got bright again. about 2 to 3 seconds in between dark and bright. i watched it move south for about 2 minutes. I also asked a man who was filling up his truck if he was seeing what i was seeing. his response was &#34; Hmm that is a weird looking plane isn&#39;t it&#34;. I then had to wait on 2 costomers and went outside around 7:43pm and looked in the area i had last seen it. the light seemed to have gotten smaller and was flashing from white to red and then blue extremely fast. It stayed in the same spot for about 5 mins  I had called my mother (she lives close to where i work) then I went outside and waited for my mom. Itstarted to moved north in the same degree and path that the White light moved except in the oppisite direction. my mom had arrived and looked at it and she thought it was a slow moveing plane.<n>

They attracted my attention because of some pulsating effect as I was bird watching on this sunny and clear sky afternoon in my garden. I ran to grab binoculars (Nicon 10x/50mm) and et voila they were really well visible flying saucers to my total astonishment. Then I&#39;ve concentrated on one as they were about to hide below the roof and sun glare. It had an asymmteric bulge rotating with about approx. 1-2 times a sec thus producing an oscillating effect as the material is pitch matte black but extremely shiny (like metallic) at certain angle to the sun. No portholes, no signs, no trail, no sound, speed was that of an aircrat roughly, but nothing like an aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen! It flew ignoring the usual airport air traffic, but there happened to be no craft flying at the time I was watching them with the binoculars. Total calm, no track or exhaust visible. The propulsion system, steady majestic way of flying and perfect formation were astounding. I wish I had my camera loaded with film and tele lense attached, but there was no time for that. Very similar to the description from London close to that date I&#39;ve seen on this site, but brown possibly because of the sunset. I only report it now because I&#39;ve learned about this site from a TV programme on the Phoenix UFO. Note that I&#39;m using an alias because of professional concerns, but the way I&#39;ve seen these things was so superb!<n>

We live in a small town and decided to go to the zoo it was closed because it was very late. but anyway while we were walking to the park we saw what we thought was an airplane at first sight and my friend my a remark about it looking odd. I did&#39;t think anything of it because I don&#39;t really take stuff like this that serius.so we starded walking again and we sat down and he said &#34;man that thing is not a plain look at how big it is!&#34; so I looked at it again and this time it was alot closer and lower. It was a trianguler shaped thing with Big red lights on the three corners that had a haze like glow to them. It was moving very slowly to the south east. I looked a little to the south and I saw what apeared to be another one following it I looked exactly the same but was moveing a little faster and in the same direction. The second Object then speed up and seamed to pass the first and went over the tree&#39;s and we could no longer see. about ten seconds later the first one speed up and was out of sight and thats all we saw of them we hurried to the car and drove in the direction in witch they went but we saw nothing. I have never saw anything fly so low to the ground and be this big it scared both of use. They seemed massive and made very small &#34;sonar&#34; sounding noises every so often. I don&#39;t Beleive in &#34;UFO&#34; but this didn&#39;t look like a human aircraft it was like nothing I have ever saw. I have made a drawing of it and will send it to you via e-mail.<n>

It moved west to north for about 2 seconds after it appeared and shot across the sky. The brightness of the light compared to the full moon.  Too fast to be a plane, it disappeared as fast as it appeared.  Even with the brightness of the full moon, it vanished into the darkness.  It left no streak in the sky.  It happened so quickly, but I will never forget the intensity.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this type of phenomomen.  This occured in Westerville OH, a suburb of Columbus Ohio USA<n>

It was so bright it cause me to involuntarily flinch or like duck a little. It was like in the instant I was seeing it out of the corner of my eye it was like it had been closer to me causing me to duck. when I turned my eyes to it. It looked about the size of a penny held at arms length but very high in the sky. the flash kind of looked like a arc flash from a welder but very large brightwhite and high. As I watched it it slowly faded and moved to the south dimming as it went. as it dimmed it seamed to have a elongated egg shape and about the same bluish color as a star. also when it was dimmer it appeared to be among the stars way up in the firmament. From where I first seen it to where it faded out completely and was gone. With a rule held at arms length it moved like three inches across the sky. It all lasted about five seconds. I&#39;m a 45 year old male and have always liked watching the stars. I&#39;ve seen Jupiter and it&#39;s moons, Saturn and it&#39;s rings, mars, and VENUS, many shooting stars satellites And also some kind of large space junk burning up in the atmosphere and it was none of the above!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Object seen straight overhead -followed to horizon.  6:14pm Arkansas<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I arrived home from work between 6:11 and 6:14 PM (Central) I looked into the sky straight up and slightly northeast. I saw a commercial air plane flying East at high altitude. The plane was leaving a dissapating contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a very white object that I first thought was a lone white crane (bird). I thought it was this type of bird because it was so white. The sun was obviously upon it. At first sight it also seemed to be &#39;flapping&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have to rule out this object as a bird. Due to several reasons:  1. The &#39;flapping&#39; was very irregular. 2. The &#39;bird&#39; reached the far horizon in 60 seconds. 3. It was still visible through the haze of the horizon, towards the sun. (No bird could reflect that much light.) 3. The speed it reached the horizon combined with its altitude. 4. Odd pattern of flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rule out an aircraft. 1. No contrail.  2. Obviously different when compared to the airliner we saw at the same moment in the sky. 3. Path of flight was SE with several fairly rapid curves more easterly then more southerly then back to the SE. 4. The speed of the object.  5. The apparent &#39;flapping&#39; which now can only be described as &#39;shape changing&#39; as it went into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rule out a satelite in orbit, or the space station, or space shuttle.  1.  The sky was still blue and the sun shining. Only something the size of the current space station could have reflected so much light.   2. The path of flight was not a staight line.  3. The space shuttles have been grounded for months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Across the street from me two spanish speaking gentlemen also witnessed the object. From their angle they could see it flying into the horizon and farther south for 10-15 seconds longer than I could.<n>

As I continue on my way to work, I noticed that the round bright orange object started to decend at a very fast speed. It dropped from a 90 degree angle to a 20 degree whitin seconds. I then thought that I was looking at a meteor falling to earth. But then the object just stopped decending. it stayed on a fixed position for about 6 seconds and then it started to travel west at a speed faster then any airplane I have ever seen. I watched it dissaper as it travel west.<n>

I turned to look at it properly and it had a rotating sphere on the underside of the craft, the reason that I know this sphere was rotating was because there were smaller spherical lights on the underside of the sphere (and on the underside not on the side or on the lip!) and these lights were moving round what seemed fairly slowly.  the rest of the underside disk appeared to be dark with no real discerning colours. the top of the craft was a golden orange colour and more of a block shape, with no protrusions or other lights there were no sounds eminating from the craft, and I only saw the craft for 2 - 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it basically hovered there and with no noise at all moved away with extreme pace, it also left a brief golden orange light trail.  I know I had just finished work, but it was definately no tiredness that caused this.  I have never ever witnessed anything like this before. I hope this might be of some help to you because it has been on my mind for months, and the friends that I have been brave enough to tell think I am bonkers, but as sure as i am sat here typing,  I saw something that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We currently live in a rural area where skies are often clear and the stars are very bright.  Upon awakening at roughly 4 a.m. 09/23/02, my attention was immediately drawn out the window to a brilliant star-like object to the SE, approximately 15 degrees up. It seemed exceptionally bright, especially since the landscape was flooded with competing moonlight. The object was flashing and pulsing red, green and white light --occasionally a flash would light up the immediate sky around it.  It first seemed motionless, yet very slowly passed from view behind the pines that surround this location. (I was keeping my head stationary on the same place on my pillow.) I had binoculars by the bed and trained them on this object as it reappeared through the trees, as I lay still. Well, through the binoculars the object seemed to change shape. At one point it was like a v-shaped pale pink blob, at another point it changed to a thin horizontal line, and at another stage a thin vertical line. This was peculiar and puzzling!  (In my mystification, I have been searching for explanations ...possibly the changes were created by the optics of the window glass?? Or atmospheric effects?) The intensity of the light faded, and when it passed behind another ponderosa, I waited for it to re-appear, but it did not. There was no sound associated with this object.  Other than the surrounding forest, which blocks some of the sky, thanks to our elevation and sparse population we have very good night sky viewing conditions --we&#39;ve spotted the ISS and enjoyed the Perseids.  I have not seen anything to compare with the brilliancy, flashings, colors and odd shape/behavior of this object.  I emailed staff at the Bruneau Dunes Observatory, who responded that I probably saw a planet or giant red star, though they couldn&#39;t really say without a better location. I haven&#39;t seen the object again; will try to make early morning observations to attempt to find a natural explanation, and will contact your site again if I feel I have found an answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We, too, suspect that the object is a celestial body, probably the star, &#34;Sirius.&#34;  We will check with the witness again to see whether that might be the explanation.

9/23/02 01:00|London (UK/England)||Triangle|16 minutes|Bright light and triangle over London, 23rd September 02, 1am|10/15/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25497.html|75|ndxe200209| Bright light and triangle over London, 23rd September 02, 1am<n> <n><n> <n><n> 23rd Sept 2002,  at 1am I was talking to a friend on the computer, I have a solid wood and leather chair.  I felt vibrations and thought I imagined it, but a second wave through the chair and stronger ones frightened me so much so that I jumped out of it and to the other side of the room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I sat and almost waited for the chair to do something else, not realising it had been a tremor at that point I got up and went out onto my balcony (I have french windows in this room), the sky was exceptionally clear, it was very cold and there was only the faint hint of a breeze. To give an idea of direction, the full moon was facing me slightly to the right and Heathrow is to the right.  I looked to the right and saw a clear light about the size of a headlight about pencil length above the rooftops of 4 story flats in that direction (I&#39;m on the 5th floor and about the same level as their roof) The glare was bright and I&#39;m very used to watching planes and helicopters being in central London.  I thought for a moment it was a plane but at the size it was, I would have expected it to move or change direction or something or at the very least, grow in shape if it was coming directly towards me for example, but it was stationary for a good 5 minutes.  I ran in and prayed my batteries were okay and hunted for my digicam (nikon coolpix 775) and ran back outside.  I took a couple of pictures but it was very cold out and I was shivering so they are a little blurred, but I also managed to get a couple of short videos though again they&#39;re a little shakey, as the camera has a 15 second silent video feature.  Had that been a plane it would have grown in size and neared except that wasn&#39;t the right direction for the usual flight path either.  A helicopter appeared from behind me and hung around between me and the full moon or there abouts and still the light didn&#39;t move straight away.  Eventually it moved slowly up and to the right in direction and I feared I would not be able to see it as it slowly passed behind my flats.  I ran to the other side of the flat and out to the front balcony.  First the helicopter came over the roof, (the whole time there was only ever the helicopter noise, nothing at all from the object itself.) It could have been a completely separate UFO as the look differed greatly from each view ! point or the same one with just the angle making it look very different.  Bu it climbed and began to come right over head where now, although it was dark as was the object (which did at that point look possibly like it could have been a plane) when I realised the pattern of red lights were alternating and going in a triangle shape, very clear bright flashing red lights in a continuous pattern, I could make out a basic triangle shape and confirm to myself that this was not a normal plane.  The object moved in front of me from left to right and I managed to get a photo of this. (Heathrow would now have been to my left, and the moon would have been behind me).  Having loaded the photo&#39;s to the computer it looks very odd.  One light shows only (they had alternated) and two of the outside edges  can be seen though they are blurry and look almost cloud like except there were no clouds whatsover and it stayed this shape the whole two-three minutes it took for it to pass over heading towards the direction of Hamstead (if you imagine the point being close to me and the flat side moving away)  I was asked if it looked like a vapour trail but this would have been completely reversed and was moving clearly (between the size of a penny and a twopence piece) in the totally wrong direction for it to have been so.  It didn&#39;t look like that to the eye, to the naked eye it was a triangle shape with red flashing/alternating lights that went round the inside edges of the triangle shape and possibly one in the centre when I try to think back. Just one edge red light showed up on the photo though and I&#39;m glad to have got as much as I did considering by now I was absolutely trembling with the cold and trying to get the object in the picture at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m very used to planes, (though not camera&#39;s!) I often watch and am used to seeing anything up to 18 in the air at one time from my view and am also used to seeing the Presidents aircraft landing in the American Ambassador&#39;s home in Regents Park directly opposite me.  It was not a plane, it was not a helicopter, it most certainly wasn&#39;t a meteor (as has also been suggested) as the shakey photo&#39;s can only show a split second still and nothing like what the naked eye sees by way of clear lights flashing in a continuous sequence and a definite shape etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;From the tremors with the chair to the object leaving, the whole thing lasted 16 minutes.<n>

The UFO was not excatly near to me, but i knew it wasn&#39;t an aircraft, because it was steadily hovered in the air. It can&#39;t be a helicopter, as it doesn&#39;t emit any noises and helicopters don&#39;t just stop for no reason. After a few minutes, it slowly retreated. And gradually, I lost sight of it. Another witness estimated the size of the UFO and stated that it could be quite large.<n>

It didn&#39;t move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the sun had just gone down behind the tree line, but it wasn&#39;t dark yet. I thought it was a star, but I started seeing more. Up to 7 at one time. I then mentioned it to the others, and we called our husbands on the cell phone. They had been watching to. They were very bright silver and moved after a few minutes and then appeared to have a tail. We stopped and took a picture, not developed yet. There was alot of traffic on this same road so I know others seen them. I found no news reports so we were very courious to hear any information on this. After they were gone we seen a dark colored helocopter flying in the area. Its hard to judge the distance but we guessed them to be over the Springfield,IL area. These were not airplanes because they sat in one place to long and then changed formation and stayed there.<n>

It was a frosted light as if lit from inside and had no markings on its uniform surface. The color was a pink-orange. At first I thought it was a hot air balloon (about the same size)but a second or two after seeing it, it turned off like a light switch and could no longer be seen in the dark. There are hot air balloons around Del Mar some miles to the South, but none fly low over houses in the dark, nor do they fly that far North. I called the golf course below it (4 Seasons)off of Poinsettia Lane to see if they had a promotional balloon up but they said they don&#39;t do things like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ps Could you perhaps include a space to &#34;write in&#34; the UFO shape on yr form?

It was like a black square hole in the sky.  It was not like a craft, but a &#34;hole&#34;.  Clouds were moving past it, but it was not moving at all.  He had seen another of the &#34;holes&#34; in another state, but I can&#39;t remember which state it was.  It was all within days of each other.  About 2 years ago, another of my sons experienced a sighting of a rectangle box shape black &#34;fog&#34; crossing the highway he was diving on.  Several witnesses were present then because they all got out of their cars and watched this &#34;thing&#34; cross the highway.  It was approximately 3 to 3 and one half feet tall, and approximately 12 to 14 feet long.  It was lying on its side, floating across the highway.  People noticed that you could not see the lights from the cars through it.  This occured around 10:00PM (22:00) and was on Hwy. 69 South of Lufkin Texas.  At the same exact time, my sister was traveling on Hwy. 69 NORTH but was just about 15 miles south of Tyler Texas at the same time, and saw another one of these things crossing the highway there.  The exception in this case was that it was standing lengthwise and crossing a 4 lane highway, leaving the highway and traveling out of sight into a pasture.  This sighting happened at about the same exact time the other one did, but they were 85 to 100 miles apart.  Neither my son nor my sister told anyone else about the event, until they told me at different times.  I had to tell them about the other one seeing it too.  I think what my truck-driving son saw is the same things that my sister and another son saw except that the truckdriver son saw them in the sky and across the country from each other.  I think the first one he was was near Washington State or Montana.  What are they?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Location in Pennsylvania unknown to us.  PD))<n>

I took a compass reading on it and it was at 135 degrees from north in the southeastern sky approximately 30 degrees off the horizon.  This object could not be seen with the naked eye.  I was looking through my binoculars at an eagle when I noticed the object.  The sky was very blue and clear and there was definitely something in the sky.  I handed the binoculars over to my wife and I gave her the approximate direction in the sky.  It took her a minute or two, but she also saw it.  She thought it looked like a baloon, but this object did not move for over 30 minutes.  We continued to view this object at 3 to 5 minute intervals and it did not move.  Since it was low on the horizon, I was able to use a tree as a reference point to mark it location.  Several high flying jets flew near this objects, but the jets appeared to be much lower than this object based upon the jet wash trails.  After 40 minutes, we could not find the object again in the same portion of the sky.  We scanned the area for several minutes.<n>

I noticed an amazing thing in sky and for a moment i was in doubt what was it and the next i able to realise that it could be a UFO, coz this thing is totally different from any type of airplane or spaceship i have known so far, and also the thing is quit large that its certainly not be an airplane.The shape of the ufo is triangular basically it was in a shape of boomrang and i could able to see the lights on that boomrang in zigzag form, if u want some more detail just contact me.<n>

I just happened to be looking up the sky{clear night} as I do when its clear out, I noticed i the North East a bright ball of light speeding in my direction. Its altitude was about 20,000 ft around the same as the aircraft from the local navy base. As ikt was getting closer the light got brighter and at its brightest moment it seemed to have hit somthing, like it bounced off and started goimd backwards on a 45 degree angle towards the sky as it was doing this the light started to stretch then it vanished. When I was first sall it I thought maybe it was a military plane with the landing lights but I imediately dismissed that because there was no noise, then I thought maybed it was a meteor or a shooting star again I dismissed those accounts as well because I never sall a light in the sky look like it hit somthing and bounce back in the opposite direction. The object was moving fast  dont know how fast but as quick as it came it vanished. I&#39;m sending this now because when it happened I didnt have a comp. I hope I,m not the only one who sall this. If it was U.F.O thats fine I would like an explantion to what I have seen. I hope you fined this info usefull.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

(100 miles west of Oklahoma City on I-40).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed the object was perfectly round, and it was extremely bright- almost too bright to look at directly at first. I also noted a unusual white &#34;florescence&#34; to it. On closer examination with my 10 x 50 binoculars, it appeared to have 2-3 internal lights of some kind that were clearly visible, similar to a hot air balloon would have. However, it was not a balloon. No other details were noted. It flew in a westerly direction roughly following I-40 toward Amarillo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it flew from overhead, and at about a 45 degree angle to the horizon, it started to rapidly change colors to a yellow, then a bright red and finally to a deep blue-purple internal glow that it maintained until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to estimate the object to be at about 5,000 feet, and moving at about 25-30 miles per hour, and it was moving steadily to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the sighting we had a SE wind at 5-7 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was in sight until about 8:15 PM when it &#34;winked&#34; out as I was watching it through binoculars. It went from about a 80 degree overhead angle to about 20 degrees above the horizon in that time. At it&#39;s closest it was about 1/2 the size of the full moon, or about the size of your thumb at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have eliminated weather balloons, planets, stars, aircraft and blimps as a possible explanation. I did notice Venus in the southwest sky about 10-15 degrees above the horizon. The object did not resemble Venus or a star. There were no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.<n>

Shot of to the right gaining altitude rapidly and disappeared. The next day, same craft, same behaviour and locality. This time witnessed by my friend Sandy. Time approx 11h15. A peculiarity about this craft is that since the 19th there was a airshow on at a nearby airforce bace where sophisticated aircraft were on display. No, this was not a aircraft, it made no sound, smoke or vapour trails. I am not aware of any man made plane with the ability to perform that sort of manouverability.<n>

It hovered for maybe lessthan two minutes and then completely disappeared beyond the hills. It seemed like it was spinning very fast. It was not a lit up, it was actually glowing. There was now rays of light shining off of it. I was with about 100 people outside a park and all you could hear was screaming from all of my friends. There was also a little dome on top of the saucer. The bottom of the saucer was smooth and rounded. My friend took pictures. There were about 10 search planes in my area after it happened that were hovering very low. We also saw a military jet fly by. Something had to have happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and with her mother, and have requested reports from the other witnesses.

9/20/02 09:01|Denver|CO|Sphere|10 minutes|Two unknown daylight lights observed high above Denver|9/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25209.html|95|ndxe200209| Two unknown daylight lights observed high above Denver<n> <n><n> <n><n> While picking up mail at a downtown Denver post office I glanced up and saw two bright white oval lights high in the sky above Denver.  They were slightly to the west, about 5 to 7 degrees to the west and slightly south of the east-west axis of nearby Colfax Avenue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were planes but were not moving as planes would, almost stationary. I pointed out the high unknowns to a postal worker and two other regulars who pick up mail at the p.o. back door. Over the next few minutes we were busy receiving mail and kibitzing, but periodially looked up at the unknowns. One observer thought they were balloons.  Their height was undetermined but some observers saw a plane in the vicinity (no contrail) which seemed to disappear as it apparently lost an angle for reflecting its image from the sun in the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next few minutes the lights seemed to move closer together and more easterly (closer to being directly overhead, but still a few degrees to the west). At about 9:08 a.m. when we looked up one of the lights had disappeared and other was a few degrees more to the south. When we looked up around 9:10 a.m. the second bright circular light had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The FAA in Washington was contacted about 1 p.m. by me and I was referred to the Denver FAA office. The &#34;watch officer&#34; I was referred to said no one else had reported anything unusual ove Denver air space.  He was unaware of any balloon launches. (I had earlier contacted someone I know at the Weather Service and they said their balloons are launched hours earlier and expressed doubt the objects observed were theirs). The Weather Service said if their balloons &#34;pop&#34; the instruments descend by parachute.  No parachutes were observed after the bright lights dsappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The NUFORC was contacted (which the Washington FAA office had suggested as a second contact number) and I was asked if I knew of wind direction and force aloft over Denver at 0900 It was suggested the Denver FAA office would have that info.  I contacted the Denver FAA office a second time to try and obtain this information as it wuld help determine if the unknows were balloons - but my second transfer to the watch officer was answered by automatic voice mail. So I referred to my earlier call, apologized if I was being a nuisance, and asked for wind directions and force for three elevations above ground level and left my work number. As of 18:30 MST my call had not been returned.  (I now know more about what to ask for when initially contacting the FAA).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This  sighting could have been the launch of two balloons by unknown researchers but until wind conditions are determined this sighting will be inconclusive.<n>
9/20/02 04:51|Spokane|WA|Unknown|5 seconds|Multiple, unilluminated high-speed craft flying over Spokane in early morning of 9/20/02.|9/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25191.html|96|ndxe200209| Multiple, unilluminated high-speed craft flying over Spokane in early morning of 9/20/02.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 4:51 A.M. (PST), I was looking at a cluster of stars just ahead of the constellation of Orion.  There is a group of 6-8 stars that are clustered very close together and I was trying to see how many I could count.  I was facing south (though I was looking straight up) and the full moon was low in the horizon in the southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, going from North to South came three objects streaking across the sky.  There were no lights, though the objects were whitish-grey in color.  They were not illuminated.  They were definitely not birds.  Birds flap their wings and cannot completely go across the sky from horizon to horizon in 5 seconds.  These things were moving at supersonic speed, faster than any fighter ever flown on this planet and were slower than shooting stars, somewhere between shooting star and supersonic fighter (speed-wise).  Suddenly, the middle object shot left, then right again, splitting the other two.  No craft on earth can make that turn at those G-forces.  All three objects were gone within 5 seconds.  It was the damndest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.  These were not lights, nor even lighted craft; these were craft that were illuminated only by moonlight.  They were solid yet there was no trail left and no sound.<n>
9/20/02 03:00|Madison|WI|Light|unsure...maybe 5?|Second sighting...Madison, WI|9/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25264.html|97|ndxe200209| Second sighting...Madison, WI<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my second submission. My first submission concerned a sighting witnessed by myself and several others. This particular sighting was all mine. I awoke just a minute or two before 3:00AM and went to use the facilities. As I was standing at the sink washing my hands, I noticed a light over Lake Mendota. Assuming it was a rescue helicopter bound for the University of WI Hospitals and Clinics ER, I looked away and finished washing up. When I looked again, I noticed the light had become somewhat brighter, and had not moved from the spot where it had been before. Now, having witnessed something like this before, AND having just seen the movie &#34;Signs&#34; several hours before, I wasn&#39;t willing to accept that this was anything unusual. As I watched the light, it began to change color and pulsate. I actually spoke out loud and said: &#34;Oh, not THIS again!&#34; half in jest, and half in earnest. As I said that, a small, red light poppped out and shot away from the larger light. Zip! And it was gone. At that point, I decided I&#39;d seen enough. I spoke again, out loug, and said: &#34;Look, you guys...either take me with you or go away!&#34;. Then I went back to bed. I have no explanations. I neither believe nor disbelieve in UFOs, aliens, or other odd phenomena. I&#39;m only reporting what I&#39;ve seen.<n>
9/20/02 02:00|Columbia Heights|MN|Triangle|5-6 Seconds|Triangle shaped object traveling east to west approximately 45 degrees above northern horizon.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36169.html|98|ndxe200209| Triangle shaped object traveling east to west approximately 45 degrees above northern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While observing an unusually strong display of aurora borealis I noticed an object traveling from east to west approximately 45 degrees above the northern horizon. This object traveled across approximately 90 degrees of visible sky before I lost it behind ground clutter. The best description I can give would be a plastic coat hanger with the hook at the top removed, leaving a flattened triangle with rounded corners. It appeared to be either clear like acrylic with many small lights inside, or perhaps a light gray that matched the background sky color with a highly reflective surface in which case the many small lights may have been reflections of ground lights. I have been an aviation buff for most of my life and this was no aircraft I have ever seen. While the shape was reminiscient of a hanglider there was no &#34;swooping motion&#34; typical of &#34;kites&#34;. Since there was no sound it couldn&#39;t have been an ultralight either,they use very noisy small engines and this was silent. The movement was straight and level so must have been powered flight. the size at arm length appeared to be about three inches wingtip to wingtip and about one inch nose to tail. While I can&#39;t say the exact distance from me I have the impression this was about the size of a small private aircraft which would give it an altitude of a few hundred feet, certainly low enough to hear engines or see someone hanging below a hanglider. Speed would be hard to estimate, but it only took five or six seconds to cross my line of sight, much faster than any private plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Satellites generally do not have a westerly component to their orbit, and they do not move across the sky as dramatically rapidly as the witness indicates here.  PD))<n>

It was very loud,like a large cargo helecopter or a smaller helo moving fast to keep up whith something.So i looked out and saw the exterior lights moving east southeast at approx. 200 feet.I started to look for a second helo thinking the sound could be from multiple craft and thats when i saw the large dark shape moving on the same azimuth.I could see no exterior lights and the shape was difficult to determine as i spoted it just before i lost line of sight.I climbed out the window onto the roof but could only see the exterior&#39;s of the helo continueing on an easterly course.<n>

At first i did&#39;nt pay too much attention i just watched, i live 5 miles from Nasa and very close to an airforce base so it isnt too unusual to see F16s flying around especially when we get so close to a shuttle launch. The movement of the lights was strange, at first they were parallel then vertical, i know there are fantastic aircraft manouvers but this happened within a second and i heard no noise at all. The lights approached me and i just watched in amazement, I wasnt scared at all. The craft was roughly 2000ft above my head and i could see it was no aircraft i had ever seen (i used to be a flight attendant) it was not a perfect chevron but not a perfect triangle either. it had three extremely bright white lights one in the middle and at each side, there was a larger red light in the rear center of the craft the underneath was like a gride or grate, it felt like it was watching me as i was watching it very weird. The craft after hovering over me for at least 50 seconds which seemed like a lifetime excelarated which sounded like a huge vacuum cleaner not an aircraft and then slowly moved over the house. I ran out to the front of the house grabbing the phone to call the police to see if anybody else was reporting seeing the same thing, and watched the craft settle like a star as beams of light danced around it zipping back and forth around the sky.<n>

These were large lights. At one time early in the sighting one of the red lights split into two red lights and faded at the same time. After we had watched these lights for about 10 minutes my husband stood up to to walk down to the surf to reel his fishing line in and suddenly just beyond the surf and very close to us, four white lights lit up one at a time in a row as if they were attached to something, I yelled at my husband to look up and he also witnessed them. These lights stayed lit for about 3 to 5 seonds and faded out. Just after these lights when out the red lights on the horizon lit up again. One at a time the red lights would light up and fade after about 3-5 seconds. I ran into the house to get binoculars and told my father in law to come out and watch. He came out with me and my husband said while I was in the house 2 more red lights had lit up in the sky. As soon as I sat down 2 more red lights lit up and one of the lights emitted a beam from the side of it and within the beam were small white lights in a row. After the last two red lights we saw nothing else for the rest of the night. My father in law was witness to the last 2 red lights. There were no aircraft in the area at this time.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Slow flying very bright ball of light, surrounded by a much larger halo of light, trailed by miles of zig-zaging smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On September 19th, 2002 I drove through Yosemite Park, California from west to east. It was about 7:45 pm and it was dark already. I noticed something very bright in the sky, and I thought it was a full moon. When I looked up I noticed a strange looking very bright ball of light, surrounded by a much larger ball of light, followed by a zig-zagging trail that was several miles long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live 5 minutes away from JFK airport in New York, and I have seen planes take off, fly, and land in all kinds of weather and lighting conditions, and I have watched many TV documentaries about missiles, the space shuttle, etc. but I have never seen anything like the &#34;UFO&#34; over Yosemite Park. The object slowly flew from west to east, from the Pacific towards Nevada and seemed to be in a slow ascend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I slammed on the brakes and stopped my car in the middle of the road, grabbed my camera and began to video-tape the object. After a few seconds I stopped the video-camera and tried to take a photo with my digital camera. Unfortunately the flash was on, so the picture came out pitch black. While I tried to figure out how to shut off the flash, the light in the sky slowly disappeared. The bright ball and the huge halo slowly dimmed away. Only the long zig-zagging trail remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I video-taped for a little while longer and tried several more times to take a photo, to no avail. I continued to drive east towards Nevada. About 30 minutes later I noticed red and white blinking lights from 2 or 3 aircrafts that came from the east (I assume from the nearby Nellis Airforce Base in Nevada aka Area 51.) and continued to circle above the area.<n>

The light was shinning down at a 45 degreen angle to the ground in a perfect cone shape. The end of the cone did not fade like light would, it cut off perfectly and flat on the bottom. It was a light as if you&#39;d see in fog conditions, except there was no fog and not a single cloud. We stood and watched for about 15 seconds when it suddenly turned into a spider web shape. The spider web shape was glowing and was perfectly symmetrical. It then faded fairly quickly leaving a light glow then completly went away. And no this was not a spider web at all, we are for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  Please see article.

In sky over ocean a huge, spherical, object pushed through the clouds.  It appeared about 100 times larger than a blimp and was primarily bright white.  It emerged from the north, sat high above the horizon, then moved south.  It had a stream of orange flame, as if from a engine.  It also had contrails in all directions as if exploding, almost.  This went on for about 10 minutes, then the white area became triangular and the contrails formed a Z, and then slowly formed other shapes as white shape faded to greenish blue.  All the dogs in the area were howling (except mine, which isn&#39;t saying anything as he&#39;s slightly retarded).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought this was the moon, but the moon was already appearing in the southern sky.  Then I thought it was a refraction of setting sunlight reflecting off the ocean and through the clouds, but it appeared extremely three dimensional and extremely bright.  If it was refraction, I&#39;ve never anything quite like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never reported UFO sightings before.  I have never seen one and was frightened and alarmed and turned on the tv to see if we were in trouble.  I am a professional journalist, respectably published, sober, and generally a skeptic.  Would like to find out if anyone else saw this thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  Please see article.

We noticed a large orange-pink bubble (about the size of a hot air balloon times 10) fairly high in the sky.  The bubble had a stationary light beam shining directly into it that was much brighter and larger than we have ever seen.  There was a streak very similar to lightning that came from the bottom of the bubble all the way to the ground.  It was also the orange-pink color.  After a few minutes, the light faded away, and the bubble slowly faded.  The lightning streak was visible for about another 10 minutes, but moved west quickly.  Both of us immediately felt that we were seeing something not of this world.

So I was very surprised when I looked outside and saw a bright cloudlike path, much like the trail left behind by a jet with a smoke trail.  This trail was very bright against the night sky, and spirled around and around, and finally amassed into a large body of cloud-like radiance.  This entire trail was so luminated, it almost looked like it was lit from within.  As I followed the path with my eyes up to this large mass, I noticed movement towards the perimeter of this mass, moving upward.  It appeared to be a small craft or object, moving upward.  The direction of the path was from south to north.  I followed this object visually for a few seconds, and then it almost appeared to explode.  I do not know what happened to it after that.

I was looking out my window to watch the sky darken (it was a little before dusk) and I saw what looked like light resembing what you would see when a plane comes in to land in the fog. Judging by the height (it seems as high as a jetliner would fly while cruising) I saw a light with a fog seeming to trail behind it, but I found it strange that if it were an aircraft with a light on in the upper atmosphere the &#34;fog&#34; would be opposite the direction it was moving.  Anyway, as it travelled along, I was waiting for what I thought would be where the light would be pointed directly in my direction, when all of the sudden, it exploded into a faint, white fireball, that resembled what looks like a firework burst.  All white, with symmetric white arms - just like what you&#39;d see on July 4.  Then they fissled out and it was gone.  I have never seen anything like this.  I&#39;m guessing that it was a meteor, but it was moving so slow, and I have seen those before.  There was no &#34;fire trail&#34; or sparks, and it was moving as if it were a jetliner.

I mistook it for the planet Venus. It seemed that the light was shining through clouds or fog. The brilliant light faded but a cone of light remained looking exactly like the sky does when the full Moon is about to rise. In fact, for a moment I thought the cone of light which radiated about 10 degrees above the horizon was the full Moon. Naturally the near full Moon was rising directly behind me in the East about 10 degrees above the eastern horizon. Also about 15 degrees due south on the horizon the planet Venus shown like a beacon. The light I saw and the resulting cone or mountain shaped light was not the Moon or Venus. I wonder if it was a rocket launch or something... the light remained in the western sky for 10 minutes before I left the scene where I had parked my car to observe this highly unusual light. The weather conditions were thus: No clouds, crystal clear skies and certainly no fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter, any idea?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.

The diameter and height of the light could not be determined. The intensity of the light seemed as a distant automobile light but very white. There was a halo and the beam was visible for a short distance from the light as a searchlight beam can be seen when it not aimed directly at the observer. No sound was associated with the beam. The beam was undulating rapidly, too fast for searching the ground. When the beam was extinguished small lights sinilar to a firework burst appeared, with no noise, in a plane centered on the light and perpendicular to it for about one second. It was not an airplane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  Please see article.

I dont know if it was making any noise due to a Cessna flying circles over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Hillsboro Airport (our local airfield) and they said that they were not tracking anything in that direction, but they said that it was probabally a military jet from the Portland Airbase. Yeah right, the base only has F-15s as their jets, and they wouldnt be flying a jet that could do what this did around here...  This was a UFO.<n>

He was looking to the west and saw a very bright light in the sky that was still in the sky.  It looked almost like a very bright star and appeared to be yellow.  He then told me that the light just faded out like a watch tower light.  I then turned west on Center Road.  After I went about a mile down the road my son saw the light again.  It was straight ahead, in the distance in the southwest sky.  Then there appeared another light in a line next to it.  The lights did not appear to be moving in the sky - just standing still.  After about 3 to 5 seconds they both faded away.  About 2 seconds later they both appeared in the northwest sky.  Then after another 5 seconds they faded away.  We were still driving west on Center Road, just past the Dixon Road intersection.  About 10 seconds later just one light appeared in the northwest sky.  It did the same thing, appeared still in the sky and then faded out.  We then continued home and ran into the house to get our camcorder.  Right when we walked out the door a bright light zoomed directly overhead at an extremely fast speed.  We stayed outside about another 15 minutes but were unable to find the lights again.  I did notice a flash of what appeared to be heat lightening, but there were no clouds in the sky.  The lightening didn&#39;t look like normal heat lightening but appeared to be in a band going across the sky.  It was very faint as it happened and only happened once while we were outside.<n>
9/18/02 21:00|Harrisburg|PA|Other|45 min.|There were a series of yellow and red light formations on the horizon of the night sky.|9/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25229.html|134|ndxe200209| There were a series of yellow and red light formations on the horizon of the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Wednesday, the 18th of September, my sister came to my apartment around 8:45 or so in the evening.  I live on a fairly high floor of an apartment building, facing the city of Harrisburg.  I was eating dinner and looking out my bedroom window, while also talking to my sister.  A bright yellow (almost planet-looking) light appeared in front of my eyes as I glanced out the window, and then just as suddenly, disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was curious as to what happened, and told my sister to check out the sky.  We both stepped closer to the window, and on the horizon, we both saw the same type of light appear a few inches away from the one I saw initially.  There were three other lights that did essentially the same thing (blink in, stay in plain sight for approx. 5-10 sec., and then dissappear).  About 15 min or so into seeing the yellow lights, a red light appeared to the lower right of the yellow ones.  It then proceeded to split into a triangle of three identical red lights, and then all simultaneously disappear.  The red formation occurred a few times.  During the second red light formation, i called a friend who lives about two miles further down Front St. in Harrisburg, and has access to the second floor.  He was able to see a red light, from his vandtage point, at the same time I was seeing it.  While the red and yellow lights were blinking in and out, there was a white light, that streaked from right to diagonal lower left (approx. 2 inches in length).  The streak occurred in a split sec. and was the only one we witnessed.  While all of these fairly steady, planet-looking lights were appearing, and then disappearing (not streaking, or fading, or even twinkling), there were much smaller (star-like) lights which were zig-zagging across the entire visible expanse of sky.  Initially, they looked like very distant airplanes, until they started erratically bouncing up and down, back and forth, and any which way.  My sister witness these &#34;bouncing stars&#34; as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a steady job, friends, and family, all of whom will concede that i&#39;m pretty down to earth.  (i&#39;ve kept two cats alive for at least a few years).  I do have a fairly liberal view of the world in general, and tend to accept a lot, but not without some proof.  I can hardly believe what I saw, but I&#39;ve witnessed almost as strange instances in the past.  The friend who I called on the evening of the 18th was the one who checked out this web site, and I felt compelled to send in this info. since other sightings in PA had been reported.  There was apparently a news report this past Sunday (the 22nd) stating that some sort of Airforce testing (flares in the sky so they could test heat-sensitive missiles) was occurring this month.  Whatever.  I &#39;ve seen flares in the sky.  They linger, and fade.  These lights DISAPPEARED!!!  I&#39;ve also seen airplanes turn course in the night sky (they don&#39;t just disappear).  Whatever these lights were, I&#39;ve never seen exactly what i saw on the night of the 18th.  I hope there are those out there who will take credence in (at least) three witnesses of a single event over a bull story from our fabulous government.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from Pennsylvania for this date.  We wonder whether the lights might have been advertising lights, but the witness insisted that such was not the case.  We spoke with this witness and found her to be lucid, serious-minded, and credible.  We may have erred in suggesting to her that the event might have been caused by advertising lights, which are reported to NUFORC on a frequent basis.  PD))<n>

I noticed a yellow/white light in the north east sky over in the area of interstate 81, north of harrisburg.  I would estimate golf ball size at arms length.  The light turned off like an over head light and then reappeared farther north.  This time the light hovered and then moved from left to right in the sky.  Became stationary and went out again.  The light appeared again in a different part of the sky, more east hovering ... on two separate occassions two others lights appeared asthough they were dropping to the left and right diagonally forming a triangle.  The second and third objects disappearing into the night.  My wife and I thought it bizarre because no other marker lights were on the objects and there was no sound.  Being prior military and around aircraft I was amazed by the angles at which these objects moved.  The activity lasted for approximately 15 minutes when I saw the light turn off.  I contacted the area airport a few days later to see if anyone else reported the occurrence.  The airport ops stated nothing unusual was reported for that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from Pennsylvania for this date.

I was not able to distinguish any shapes to the phenomenon but I was able judge some relative distance because I was able to see the mountain tower lights across the river that are located in the Linglestown area.

Normally I don&#39;t allow dogs around when am working bees but my hired hand brought along his coon hound.  It was on Septemeber 18 before lunch around 11 in the morning.  The dog strated barking not baying but barking like something was hurting its ears.  My wife had brought lunch out to my nephew who was picking his early cotton and was going to have lunch with us.  We do this alot in the fall when getting bees ready to move south.  She came barreling into the lane in a hurry and was excited as the dog.  Well, I have not had this much excitement in along time and ask what is worong.  She says that she saw a silver flying saucer when she dropped lunch off at the nephews place.  it was headed our way.  I laughed at her and she got angry but we chuckled.   Just then to the north east was a silvery disck like plane it was going slow like it was looking for something in the cotton sometime it would just stop.  My wife dropped our luhcn to the ground.  i wraaped everthing up saying we&#39;d go to Campbel for lunch.   We got into Campbell at the cafe down town and I saw an old friend from down in Gibson, course my wife had to stratle him with what she saw.   He indicated that he had been picking and saw asimilar light.   He reminded that I was a volunteer ((deleted)) and to file a report.  The dya was shot and I decided to make thebest of it.  I contacted another deputy  in another county and ask him if he any calls on any odd aircraft sightings.  He siad that he had earleier in the morning had several near Steele, Deering, Bragg City, Peach Orchard and heard calls from Dunklin County too.  When I told the dispatcher what i saw the decision was not to come in and for get the paperwork.  Today at noon i got a call to talk to some authroities.  These guys were peculiar looking dudes in their designer suits, I aked for credentials they would not give me any and proceeeded to threaten me if I ddi not cooperate and name names.  At that point I told then to get off my property as th! er were trespessing.  One of hem snickered and I told him wipe his goddamned smile off of his face.  As he tuenred to wlk out I kicked  him in the ass left a boot print and he went face first into the mud-his buddy picked him up.  I got the plates on their car it was arental  ifound after running them.  My boss told me to forget everyting-i said i would not and he said that they had put some pressure on him but would not tell me how or what.  I want to know what was it wee saw and who were those assholes we saw but did not ask to have come around here.

9/17/02 23:30|Portland|OR|Unknown|10 minutes|Sighting of a possible beam or tether directly connected from the ground to an aircraft at an altitude of 2,500 ft.|9/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25126.html|144|ndxe200209| Sighting of a possible beam or tether directly connected from the ground to an aircraft at an altitude of 2,500 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking to the South from my 2nd story kitchen window, what I first observed was what appeared to be a blue/purple beam, which was wavy in shape, but completely linear in direction. This beam had the appearance of a thin streak of lightning, yet was relatively dim. It appeared to be fluorescent in nature, as opposed to lighted from any external light source. The beam was very clearly connected to the ground, approximately 1/4-mile south from my location. Upon first sighting the beam, it was angled away from me at approximately 60 degrees from the horizon, facing Southeast. Following the beam upwards, it grew dimmer with distance, becoming invisible to the eye at approximately 200-300 meters. Upon following the beams upward trajectory, I spotted an aircraft flying at approximately 2,500 ft. in a North to South trajectory, with seemingly normal exterior lights: 2 white strobe lights, with 1 steady dim red light between the 2 white strobes. The strobes were blinking together, at an interval of 2 quick strobes in rapid succession separated by 3/4 (.75) second between bursts. The strange beam appeared to be literally connected to this aircraft, although at that distance I could not confirm this due to the beam becoming too dim at that altitude. The reason I say that the beam appeared connected to the craft is this; as the aircraft passed overhead from South to North, the angle of the beam changed precisely with this movement as though it were tracking the aircraft or being emitted from the aircraft to a fixed ground location. I lost sight of the aircraft several times, but needed only to follow the path of this beam upwards to relocate the aircraft&#39;s position. The angle of the beam changed from and angle of 60 degrees facing South East, to 90 degrees straight up, to an angle of 45 degrees facing North, precisely in unison with the aircraft as though it were a tether of some sort, attached to the aircraft and fixed to the ground. The aircraft proceeded to fly in its linear trajectory to the north, until at s! uch a di stance as to be no longer visible. The beam remained pointing to the north in the direction of the aircraft&#39;s last visible position, for several minutes preceding the aircraft&#39;s departure. I observed the beam as well as the aircraft through my binoculars. At this higher magnification, the beam appeared unsolid and quite wide. The structure of the beam was wavy, similar to the structure of lightening, although its path was ultimately perfectly linear. The beam maintained a constant luminosity, and did not appear to be changing shape, despite its wavy, electricity-like appearance. The width of the beam was comparable to a toothpick held at arm&#39;s length, and was blue/purple in hue. The closest comparison I can think of to describe this beam would be a semi-transparent fluorescent tube. It was also comparable to a thin, focused beam shining through haze, although it was a clear night. I have ruled out the possibility of some sort of physical tether, i.e. kite string, for the following reasons: 1) The apparent size was far too thick - a tether seen from even as close as 1/4 mile away would be nearly invisibly thin, were it any less than 6 inches in thickness. 2) The linearity of the line was absolutely perfect - it was not sagging earthward as would be expected with any sort of tether, even under extreme tension. Yet it truly appeared to be anchored to the aircraft above, as well as the ground below. After observing the beam and aircraft for 1 minute and it became apparent that their motions were somehow unified, I awoke my wife from bed so that she could verify what I was seeing. She was easily able to see the beam, which she said appeared to her like a high-flying jet plane&#39;s vapor trail, but aiming directly into the ground at a very close distance. After the aircraft had left, and the beam had ceased movement but was still visible, I decided to leave my home to try and locate the point where it contacted the ground. As soon as I was on ground level, my vertical line of sight was too narrow and the su! rroundin g lights were too bright so that I could no longer see the beam. I quickly returned to my second floor window to verify it was still visible. It was, so I again left my home and drove in my car to approximately directly below and a bit closer to where I suspected the beam to be. The drive was approximately 1 minute. I searched the sky for an additional minute, and then returned home. I was away from home for no longer than 4 minutes. Upon returning home, the beam was no longer visible. In hindsight, I should have remained at home and kept the beam in sight. But my curiosity was too great, and the beam disappeared sometime during my 4-minute search away from home. The total duration of this sighting was approximately 8 minutes, from the moment I first observed the beam, to the moment I left my home to search for its source. At no point was any sound audible. I am an amateur astronomer and aviation enthusiast, so I am constantly observing the sky and local aircraft with a telescope and binoculars, but have never witnessed anything abnormal until now. My father is an international pilot, and we have discussed the many highly strange natural phenomena that he observes regularly during his flight paths over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Arctic. My understanding is that this phenomenon is completely unique, so I am extremely curious to learn if any other similar observances have occurred elsewhere.<n>

They looked like dueling fireflies the way they speed and stopped and zipped around each other, almost as if they were &#34;chasing&#34; or performing acrobatic manuevers.  At one point, two flew into the cloud and the cloud lit up like an explosion (a bit like lightning), but there was no sound, no thunder.

They were in a southern direction passing fairly low about 5000ft between Mt. waialeale and the sleeping giant. I told my mother to come and see and she looked and thought it was odd. She didnt have much to say. The lights were at an angle and looked like they were gaining altitude but in a very even way like if connected by some magnetic force.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They then flew past the sleeping giant and for 15 seconds i couldnt see them so i ran around the porch to the east of my house and i faintly saw them because of lihue and kapaas city light. Now they looked like if they were at about 20,000 ft. They just headed higher and higher eastbound over the ocean until they dissapeared. I didnt mention it for a while but a year later my freind said he saw a group of lights passing eastbound from his house which is about 8 miles north of mine. He described them the same way traveling in an array. I hope you can tell me what they were I am very interested.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought perhaps it&#39;s a comet? It was very high up.  We continued to watch as is it&#39;s shape began to look more like a &#34;V&#34; and we took a picture of it. You could not really see the object as much as what appeard to be it&#39;s trail.  We eventually passed under it at a very high altitude. Then my freind spotted two more of these high on the horizon and we eventually passed under each of them. They were odd looking, not really like a jet aircraft. I have a good picture I can submit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD))<n>

It almost seems translucent.  My friend and I both had video camera&#39;s on hand which is strange in itself as we don&#39;t go around with camera&#39;s typically.  My point is that we have never reported a sighting before and never went looking for this to happen but look forward to someone telling us what this is on our film.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One more detail to add is that when we both were looking in our viewfinders recording it...at times you would think we were zooming in and out when we were not.

Baldy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my car talking to a friend when i pointed out to that person, &#34;hey check out that UFO!&#34; I said it in jest but just as I finished saying it, the UFO (which looked like a ball of light) went out...the ball of light went away, then it lit up again, and then proceeded to go off again...then it moved. My friend noticed the movement first. We proceeded to call my friend&#39;s sibling. She came over and got in the car and we showed her where it would be, she looked and it did it again, it illuminated again, then went out abruptly. We got four of our other friends to come outside and see the phenomenon. They arrived and could see the object we were looking at (you could still see a slight outline of a ship with other dim lights attached to it). They thought we were crazy until they saw it light up too. Then out of nowhere a second light appears to the left of the first one. At first they took turns lighting up, then they both remained lit for about a minute solid. They would periodically turn off and turn on again and adjust positions. We could tell they weren&#39;t stars because they were hovering in front of a mountain, they weren&#39;t planes either...they were flying to low. There was another craft higher up above the two &#34;lights&#34; that had reddish lights that got brighter...it remained in one position throughout the ordeal...only strafing from left to right every so often. The three &#34;lights&#34; formed a trangular shape. The other two ships were still moving though...they were getting closer to the ground. My friends all left to go to the mountains to get a closer look, and they saw the &#34;lights&#34; all the way there. I went home to get my video camera to film it. When I got back to the spot where our first sighting occured the &#34;lights&#34; had already descended past the horizon which the roofs of the homes in the neighborhood created.<n>

This particular night was very clear. This area is very busy with airplane traffic. I am still shaking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Note error in date.

9/15/02 22:44|Quebec City (Canada)|PQ|Formation|50 minutes|Sustained observation of multiple objects, independent and in formation, in the Quebec City night sky|9/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25098.html|158|ndxe200209| Sustained observation of multiple objects, independent and in formation, in the Quebec City night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 22:45 on September 15, 2002, I witnessed a chevron-like formation of 5-6 objects approaching Quebec from the SE at approximately 5-10K feet.  Each individual object was of an illuminated white colour, and seemed to resemble the shape of a bird. The formation was completely silent, and flew smoothly past several clearly identifiable commercial and private aircraft at a speed &gt;250 mph.  After the formation had disappeared in the NW sky, I observed two objects flying independently.  Whether these had come from the formation I had observed is unclear.  The first object was of the shape previously described. It flew at roughly the same altitude and speed as the formation, yet seemed to circle and hover in the WSW sky. Barring it&#39;s speed and luminescence, it&#39;s trajectory did fit with that expected from a hawk or other predatory bird.  I can only describe the shape of the second object as a point of light.  This object flew at a higher altitude than that already described (&gt;10k feet), and reached incredible speeds.  What was most impressive was the flightpath that it followed; my best description of this object&#39;s trajectory would be &#34;extremely ERRATIC&#34;.  At such a high rate of speed, this object seemed to turn and bank with almost no leeway, in the same manner one might observe a firefly or other small insect to do as it is blown in the wind. I also described the pattern this object made in the night sky to a colleague as that which might be expected to result from someone moving a laser pointer around the ceiling of an auditorium.  The possibility that a ground-based device created this image, however, can be ruled out by the fact that the observed object would come into and out of view as it passed behind sparse cloud cover.<n>

Then, all of a sudden, two bright lights came out of the west moving very rapidly towards the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were about three or four times the diameter of a bright star and it looked like they were made up of four lights: three orange lights surrounding a yellow one in the center.  From my relative perspective, the two objects were flying about three inches from each other, though the actual distance between them is unknown since I don&#39;t know the altitude these things were at.  They were flying so perfectly in formation that at first I thought it was one object.  I excitedly yelled to my girlfriend who was with me at the time to look up and see the objects.  She quickly noticed the objects too and watched with me as they flew quickly to the east horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they apporached the horizon they started doing some weird, non-ballistic maneuvers that told me it was two seperate objects.  moving quickly back and forth closer to eachother and then farther apart.  We watched them until they disappeared out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire sighting lasted about 5 to 7 seconds because the objects moved so quickly.  They also did not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The primary observer is a 25 year old student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  The secondary observer is a 20 year old student at the same school.<n>

As I was looking up at the night sky to the west, I saw what looked like a bat or bird flying due east. It flew very fast. Faster than any bat or bird. It had a dim glow and pulsated and flew in a straight line. It made no sound. I was very excited and my heart was pounding. I knew what I saw. I ran into the house and told my wife that I just saw a ufo and to call my mother and tell her to get her cam-corder ready. (She lives next door.) When I went back outside, about 20 seconds after that sighting, I looked back to the exact spot where the ufo originated in the sky, and saw a bright light going the same direction as that ufo. It was a white light and it moved straight briefly then dropped down very quickly and came back up in a counter-clockwise movement and back to the point in the sky where it came from. both sightings combined lasted only about 2-5 minutes. It was just amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a genuine report. Although this is very odd, my wife has witnessed a daylight sighting of a trianglur shaped ufo at low altitude 2 years ago and my mother and 4 other witnesses saw a cigar shaped light type ufo around 1974. Both of these sightings as well as the described on took place in the same town literally blockes apart. I will encourage those witnesses to report to this web-site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

When it got dark we drove around the park and found some other people staying late and parked by them so that we would feel safer and to watch the stars. The other people there were partying but we, my ex and I, had no alcohol or drugs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We laid in the bed of the pick up truck to look for shooting stars and I started to notice what looked like a Satellite or a NASA Shuttle dot of light slowly going across the sky. I have been watching these kind of lights for years and didn&#39;t really think anything about it. But right as it was heading towards the horizon I started to notice little BLUE pin pricks of light zipping past the slow moving, white, satellite. At first I thought I was just moving my head and it was just a star or something reflecting off the lenses of my glasses but after the first one I began to see more of them and they were not following the same path as the other. The first one went straight along the same direction as the Satellite but the next one was zigzagging back and forth across the sky! They were about the size of the average, mid sized, star in the night sky but a bright aqua blue. They appeared to be extremely high in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next hour or so I saw one maneuvering across the sky jerky Zigzag, Smooth and straight, and S-Shaped curves. From the position of laying in the bed of the pick up truck looking straight up it took about 4 seconds from spotting it to disappearing below the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an amazing experience that I will never forget and I still look for them when I am driving across the southwestern states and have a good clear view of the sky!  I was a believer just on the facts but having an experience where I could actually see something this extraordinary myself has truly crystallized my belief that we are truly not alone!!<n>

As i did, and looked into the sky, there it was. It was flying down making a whisling noise with 3 bright lights flashing. Then it stopped and hovered over the trees. It made no noise after that. I just stood there with my jaw on the ground. It hovered right above the trees. It was wobbling. Then it turned in a circle, and it flashed a bright red light. Then i knew the show was over, and i went to go back in. I had one more glimpse of the object as it was leaving, and it had 2 tail lights. I cant believe no one else saw it. It was meant for me to see. The next night, I had a dream that I saw 3 beings around my bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At about 9:35 I was driving to return a movie and saw a brilliant bright light streaking across the sky in my sight, I had to stop the van and look.  As the object traveled across at an extremely high rate of speed it disappeared.  I couldn&#39;t believe it.  It was something unexplainable.  I returned home and contacted Langley Air Force Base who confirmed that they had no testing or aircraft up tonight. (we have cloudy conditions here as the tropical depression approaches) I also contacted the local TV station to see if it was perhaps a meteor of some kind or if perhaps someone else had called in about this incredible sight.  They informed that they had any calls yet but that they would check for the possibility of a meteor or whatever else it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have NEVER seen anything like this, this bright object was traveling at an incredibly high rate of speed and just disappeared in mid air.  I wish to God I had a camcorder or camera with me at the time.  Proof is always better with a photo or picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope you check this out or at least find this as interesting as I do.  ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was more than likely less than a minute.<n> <n><n> I stopped my van in the street to watch it.  I did see it though.  I am not some nut case who thinks green men are invading.<n> <n><n> I was driving my vehicle and noticed the object through the windshield on my left hand side (the front left side).  It was very bright and was traveling extremely fast.  It was at this point I stopped the van (there wasn&#39;t any traffic in my lane).  As I watched the object soar through the sky, I tried to see if it could be one of Langley&#39;s aircraft, but the object disappeared as it was traveling from NE to NW.   There was no trail that I saw behind it, it just disappeared mid air.  I was shocked.  I still can&#39;t believe I<n> <n><n> saw it all.<n> <n><n> This did however occur and I immediately called Langley AFB/NASA to ask if there was any type of testing or flights in the air.  They assured me there were none.  I spoke with 2 people there and told them what I had observed.  I also contacted the local news to check on the possibility of a meteor or<n> <n><n> if perhaps other people had phoned in about the object as well.  They said I was the first so far but they would check it out.  No meteor reporting so far.<n> <n><n> Anyway, you can choose to believe what you want, but I did see this happen.  I really wish I could have captured the whole thing on film for irrefutable proof, but that just isn&#39;t the case.<n> <n><n> Thank-You again for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END FOLLOW-UP))<n>

As we were driving down the road just outside of Mercier I saw what appeared to be really bright stars in the distance.  After a few minutes I asked my husband &#34; Are those airplanes up ahead, or really bright stars?&#34;  Considering that tonight was overcast and no other stars were visible in the sky he resopnded that they were probably helicopters looking for pot fields.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes the two lights ahead in the sky changed posistion.  The one that was higher up, and to the right remained in the same place, but the lower one to the left began to move westward at a fast pace.  Now we were very curious as it was moving far too quickly to be a helicopter.  Our 8 year old son who was in the back seat pointed out another one to the right of our vehicle visible from the passenger side. ( the other one was still immobile in front of us)  While we were stopped at a light ( around 8 pm) the one on the passenger side slowly flew over head.  I unrolled my window and stuck my head out for a better view...what I saw gave me shivers...this was no plane or helicopter.  The object was triangular with lights at all three corners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen thousand of airplane and helicopters at night, and never have I ever seen light formations such as these on an aircraft, nor have I ever seen an aircraft first be stationary in the sky then move quickly such as these.  We saw them for about 10 - 15 minutes, and there were about 5 different craft in the sky at the time...all of this same type though we only saw two of them fly directly overhead.  My husband, son and myself all saw the distinct triangle...and my husband swears he could see the sky through the center of the triangle.  This object appeared to be larger than a 747, and flying quite low for us to see it&#39;s shape so clearly.  There was not a star in the sky as it was over cast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we crossed the Mercier bridge and passed the  Dorval airport we saw many other airplanes ...some flying directly overhead...and I did not see anything that looked like this triangular object. ( Not to our surprize as I had previously mentioned it moved like no other aircraft we had ever seen.)  Our son said it might be  a stealth bomber..which I refute due to the fact that it was much larger than the stealth...much more triangular, had lights and as far as I know Stealths do not remain stationary in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surely someone else has seen these lights...when we were stopped at the lights there were many other cars around, but noone seemed to be gazing at the sky.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we got home my husband and myself decided to  do a little investigation on the internet, apparently there have been a few sightings in Quebec along the St. Laurence river ( one even in the exact area we were in ) most involving triangular, or chevron shaped anomalies in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Is the Canadian government testing any aircraft ( at night ) that would fit this description?  Or are they as I fear ( I&#39;m a big chicken) U.F.O&#39;s? In the hopes from getting feed back from people who have seen these aircraft, or at the very least know more about U.F.O&#39;s than we do, we are posting this account on pertinent web sites, and sending it out to some local enthusiasts.<n>

Nevertheless, I remember it well enough; its not exactly something I will ever forget.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a bright, sunny, beautiful day, not a cloud in the sky. I was in the car in the back seat, on the right side. Several people were in the car with me, we were driving down the street, maybe 40 or 45 mph. I looked up and suddendly saw a small, round, metallic object hovering silently above the tree line. It didn&#39;t seem like it was more than 500 ft in the air. The UFO was reflecting the sun violently, the top of it was very bright. There was no jet streak. Also, it might have been spinning, but it was difficult to tell. The really interesting part is the fact that I had no urge to tell the other people in the car. For some reason I got this weird sense of calmness, like I somehow knew that the beings on board meant me no harm. So I just stared at this thing for maybe a minute or two, trying to figure it out as it contunued to hover in the air. I was also in the process of reading a book about UFO conspiracy, so the experience was especially surreal, since it was on my mind. The most outstanding part of the experience was when it left. When it departed, it did so in a path that was directly away from me, moving in a staight line. So, from my perspective, it appeared to get smaller and smaller, at a very high rate of speed. Very very high rate of speed. The craft literally blasted off into the atmosphere and out into space in a matter of seconds, and still, making no noise at all. It still left me with that state of calmness, and I hesitated to tell the others who were in the car. I still havn&#39;t told them, they probably won&#39;t believe me. I honestly believe that the beings on the craft knew that I saw them, and somehow made a telepathic connection with my subconcious mind, which calmed me, preventing me from feeling scared. The fact that it went away DIRECTLY from my point of view, in a staight line, I feel, supports this, since the chances of that happening coincidentally are very slim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

For this reason, I was paying more attention to the night sky than I usually did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking toward my house at the top of a hill. On the sidewalk, I was facing up the hill. There is a large bridge that crosses the river to my left and a graveyard on my right. I had just cleared the bridge when in my peripheral vision I thought I saw something in the sky. I turned my head and expected there to be nothing there, but I was surprised to see that there was something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was an unlit, noiseless hovering object that was floating slowly toward me. There were no lights and no markings to speak of. The only way I even detected it was the light reflecting off of the bottom of the object from the bridge&#39;s street lights. The object was at the height of a 3 to 5 story building, it was hard to tell. It was size of a large vehicle or bigger. Since it was difficult to judge the distance it was also difficult to judge the size. As it got closer to me I thought I could make out some detail - maybe a corner or a surface feature on the bottom. It could have been triangular, square or pentagonal - really no way to tell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it was nearly above me, I panicked and picked up the grocery bag - which I had dropped moments before - and ran up the hill about 15 or 20 meters. I stopped and turned to see if I was being followed but the object was still moving down the hill and had altered course slightly to the east and was moving toward the centre of town. I had passed underneath a lit pedestrian crossing sign and in 30 seconds or so, the lights from the sign obscured my view of the object as it got further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got home and recruited my two cousins to get a flashlight and help me see if I could find the thing. We found nothing. I regret not following it in the first place, but I was scared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I put a rope in the tree to help pull the tree over then I cut the tree half way through, I then went over to the rope to see if I could pull the tree over, when I looked up there they were 4 round objects going south west at a very slow speed slower then any plane and there was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS I watched them go over I noticed that the one in front looked different than the other three. Then the very last one moved a little faster and connected or docked with the third one. and together they looked like the leader. the direction they were going would have taken them over or close to the rockford air port at about 10:00 am  I dont know if we were the only ones to see them or not I looked in the rockford     paper the next day but there was nothing said about them. I should have stopped what I was doing and called the air port<n>

It was early in sept so it was still warm,  i was talking with dad about possible life out there in the universe we both agreed there has to be,just as we finished talking about the subject there was this object/ufo that i noticed entered through the atmosphere and was moving very fast about 250 mph or less and i thought it was a comet or something but i was wrong it slowed down and made a 180 degree turn as it changed direction it slowed down very fast and now stopped or hovered above a tree i was about 30 or 20 yards from it and then there was this blinding light and i couldn&#39;t see alot and i felt paralyzed and helpless its hard to remember alot but i think there may have been a blue orb surrounding my body so i couldn&#39;t move.  Like i said it was 8:30 i thought it only 5 or 10 min this event happend,as i began to move again i saw it leave and go straight up into the night sky.  As i walked inside i looked at the clock and it was 10 pm what i wonder is what happend from 8:30 to 10 i dont recall anything except what i told here.  In total i have seen 3 ufos the second ufo was in a field i was on a bus and i looked out onto the field and i saw a hovering gold ufo it was orb shaped and then right infront of my eyes it dissapeared.  The third i was at a store and it was cigar shaped and the clouds were 200 yards infront of it,it was moving very very slow and it had no wings or tail and it had a black front it was cigar shaped also,so i looked away and then looked back and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever happened &#34;I BELIEVE&#34;!.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

We were standing outside of the car when we saw this array of lights that appeared to be running lights of some sort of flying object.  This was not a plane or helicopter or any sort of craft that we had ever seen before.  It was about 150&#39;-200&#39; above the water and about 300&#39; away from us or off the shore.  The lights were extremely bright and this object was moving very slowly, maybe 15-20mph.  The lights appeared to be in a straight line very close to each other.  One end of the object seemed to come to a point and then goy wider to the other end, almost like a cone shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it took off at an amazing, unbelievable rate of speed at the same altitude.  It was now over the woods next to the lake and about 500&#39;-600&#39; away from us it appeared to dive into the trees and disappear, and it looked like it crashed in the woods.  During this whole ev! ent there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  Even when it appeared to crash in the woods (which should have made a lot of noise) there was no sound at all.  We walked over in the same direction as the crash but there was no sign of any wreckage or landing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe that we called the police but they didn&#39;t seem to care or believe us.  I know what I saw that night was not of this world.  It was the most fascinating and scariest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.<n>

I was in the car with my girlfriend when we both say a very large flash of blue light in the East-Northeastern part of the horizon.  The light appeared to be ground based and only lasted for about a second at full brightness.  The part that I find odd about this flash (to make me not think it was just someone with fireworks) is that at the exact moment the flash started, the radio in my car went out and stayed out until the flash had faded (about 5 seconds total from beginning of the flash to the return of the radio signal).<n>

They both had three very bright, red flashing lights and it seemed to me like they (the UFO&#39;s) had a triangle-like shape . At first I thought that these where low flying planes but it couldn&#39;t have been possible because I heard no turbine sound. Next, I called my Mother to run out in to the garden otherwise she would not believe what I saw. Suddenly, one of them disappeared, and we couldn&#39;t believe our eyes!! Then, after approx. 15 seconds the other object disappeared at the exact same position as the former one.<n>

I and another employee, and a government inspector were in a observation post above and behind the weapon used to test the ammunition. This test was conducted at night in order to see the tracer. We were firing and impacting about 5000 meters down range. To my surprise two lights appeared in the sky about 500 ft high and about 1500 meters down range. Thinking a aircraft had adccidently entered a forbidden airspace I called for a stop to all firing. The lights were lit for about 5 seconds, I telephoned range control to see if any aircraft were in the area, they said no. It was total quiet no sound of a plane. The two lights that were side by side looked about 30-50 feet apart, estimating from the distance from us. After about 10 minutes a light from above appeared on my right, just above the low clouds. This light was on for about 2 seconds, the light came on again, this time directly above us for about another 2 seconds, then a third time to the left of us. No sound of any kind could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I asked her if she saw it and joked about it being a UFO, within 1 minute the object had became much larger and looked like it was coming towards us at an insane speed. As the object approached we saw it was a craft of some sort, glowing red, with a array of lights.  The object made no noise, I tryed to photogragh it but the picture did not come through. It went almost directly over us and our small resort hotel and vanished behind the trees. We looked at each other went to our room and told my Mother and Sister what happened. We both strongly beleive that what we saw that night was from another planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I notice these black things up in the sky and thought (at first) they were geese flying.  Someone that was with me said, &#34;No, those aren&#39;t geese.&#34;  So I looked harder and noticed there were more of them.  The first bunch I saw was 5, black, circular objets, to their diagnal was 4 more, then 3, then 2, then 1.  They all seemed to be hovering in place.  After about ten minutes the first five started moving.  Then the other groups followed.  They moved west then disappered.<n>

So the  sound went chuk chuk chuk whishzzzz, it was very mechanical, I thought mabe a helicopter, but the whishzz confirmed negative on the helicopter, so I looked out the second story window to the east from downtown spokane. I first noticed a cat on the front lawn who was uncannily looking up at the sky toward the east, thats when I saw what looked like a planet, solid white light. Then I noticed it moving towards me (westerly) I thought maybe a plane ,until the light made some loops, half moons, figure eight, and right angles, by then I was waking my girlfriend on the couch, saying listen carefully to the freeway, and notice the other noise, she heard it and then I said look at this, and pointed. So I went downstairs to get a better look outside, I sat down for about 20 minutes watching, it then hovered in place (bobbing motion I could slightly detect, I then seen the second obect which was to the southeast of me, or south of the first obective. The both stopped for about 6-10 minutes, leaving me to wonder if I was seeing anything at all but stars and planets. Then the starting moving again, The first one did some pretty impossible moves and angles, and then I saw the additonal lights come on. There where three in all, One at the top and two and the bottom. It then went back to one light, and cycled to 2 lights before returing to one light. It then appeared to move far away and fade and then move close and brighten, this happened numerous times, before stopping and freezing again. Then the second light which was flashing different colors, blue white and green I think, it was flashing very quickly, and making some very acrobat movements which are not possible in our technology, right angles, etc.  It stopped moving at the same time as the first obect, I then seen the ! third ob ect briefly, it was further away, and appeard between the first two, and then faded away and disappeared. I watched for a while longer as the two objects appeard to stand still hovering. I got up and went upstairs, looked out the window and the first object was gone, the colored was moving away rapidly towards the south, then the first object reappeared, disappeared, and the reappeared again. I wached as it disappeared again, this time in blink it reappeared a large distance east of its origINAL position for a blink and then blinked in again to the north of the second postion. Thus going point to point in a triangle disappearing and reappearing like it teleported almost, and then disappeared altogether, the second object was still moving, and then it two just vanished. 2 - 5 minutes after that, I saw a very high speed jet come through the direct path heading west, like it was in pursuit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 7:30 I noticed more jets in the sky, I thought the where moving through, as they went to the East, then I saw some coming back the other way, thats when I noticed nothing but jet trails from horizon to horizon in parrellell and criss cross patterns. There was a lot o them and they preceeded to do this for about 5 - 6 hours.<n>

The area is dominated by residential housing, schools, religious centers and surrounded by farmlands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At roughly 2:45 am I decided to step outside for a breath of fresh air. The night was clear and windless. As I gazed upon the stars a grouping of them began to move. My first thought was that I was having a dizzy spell so I gave my head a shake and refocused my gaze upon the sky. I soon realized that I wasn’t dizzy at all when three points of light, forming a triangle made their way from south to north. The triangle of lights moved at a speed similar to satellites but unlike &#34;satellites&#34; this grouping changed directions 30 seconds into the sighting. The triangle began to move east. The object was either very large or very low and appeared to blot out passing stars. The object was completely silent. The lights on each tip were solid white but of very low intensity. There was a distinct impression that this object was doing its best not to be seen as it moved across the star field. As I realized what I was seeing It occurred to me that I should attempt to make record of the sighting. Very quickly I entered the house and grabbed my digital video camera. I returned to the front of the house and began filming the object as it made its way towards the northeast. I soon lost sight of the object behind a neighbor’s home and quickly ran to the backyard to resume filming. I was unable to find the object from that point on. Shortly after the object had disappeared a number of dogs in the neighborhood began howling and barking. This was all captured on video but the triangular formation of lights (or any stars for that matter) could not be resolved on film. I am willing to send you the footage in the hopes that you can somehow enhance what is there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Leduc is southeast of the Edmonton International Airport and I can tell you with the authority of living near the strip for over 10 years that this was NOT A PLANE and if it was it was heading in the wrong direction for a landing. The lights did not blink nor did they form any standard aircraft lighting array that I am aware of. The lights were not bright enough to be considered effective or safe landing lights. The bottom line is that the object in question was far too huge to be compared to anything I&#39;ve seen in our local skies. It was more like the corner lights were used to camouflage the object into the surrounding star field. I consulted the &#34;Heavens Above&#34; satellite tracking system for my area (www.heavens-above.com) to attempt to confirm the satellite theory but there was nothing in the sky at that time that would even remotely account for a tight triangular formation I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting may have been caused by the three NOSS satellites, but we do not know if satellites would be visible above Alberta at that time of the morning.   For positive identification of NOSS, we recommend the following website, to which we were only recently introduced:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://home.earthlink.net/~sigma04/NOSS_UFO_Identification.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> PD))<n>

My wife and I were out star gazing as we always do when weather permits.  There had been a lot of overcast the past few weekends enabling us to enjoy our hobby.  This evening was a little cloudy but not bad so we were not going to miss it!  We set up as quick as we could and started gazing.  As I said it was cloudy so when the clouds were over head we would take a break, sit and have some coffee, smoke, whatever.  During one of are little breaks my brother-in-law came by to talk, so he sat outside with us.  Later around 0030 or 0100 it happend something we never thought would, as I looked to the sky to check the cloud cover I seen a pitch black Triangle moving very slowly across the sky.  I pointed to the sky and asked donnie to look up when he did he couldn&#39;t believe it.  I yelled to my wife who was getting coffee when I told her to look up she did and droped the cups.  I hurried to get the camera pointed and snaped some shots.  It was heading SSE very slowly and did not make a sound the entire time,  It was very close to the ground as well I say that because the clouds helped to define it&#39;s shape, because it was below the clouds.  When I started snaping pictures It changed direction from SSE to ENE and was gone just like that.  We saw no lights at all from the second we first seen it till it changed direction and left.  We sat outside the rest of the night hoping for it&#39;s return but have never seen it  or anything like it since.<n>

Just as I had lit the ciggarette a what I thought to be a shooting star appered out of the corner of my eye.  The only thing unussuall about this paticular shooting star was that it was fairly large, headed straight for the ground, instead of accross the sky, and it was so bright yellow I had never seen anything like it before. Then as soon as the shooting star faded, directly behind it I saw 4-5 very faint but organized what appered to be stars.  Except that these stars shaped like a rounded triangle.  And by that mean the lines we not straight but instead curved just so. Another characteristic that ws very peculier was that they to have moved very slowly but always staying the excattly the same distance apart.  Which may suggest 4-5 objects flying in formation or one large ship with just its perimiter lights on for lack of a better term. So in other words it just defined the outline of the ship.  The ship came out of the Eastern sky heading west at about 10 miles an hour tops, assumeing that in flying terms that is very slow. It almost seemed to creep along at a snails pace.  After heading west for about two solid minutes it then turned south and headed directly towards south mountain where alot of other sightings have accured.  I also believe that this is the same ship that was wittnessed on march 16 1997 over presscott, paulden, glendale, and then finnally in Tucson all on the same night.  This triangle shaped ship seems to almost haunt Phoenix, Presscott, and all of Arizona.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that it is surmise to assume the object described here is the same as any of the multiple objects observed on March 13, 1997.

In one formation of the changing clouds, they were close to left and right, and significantly further out to see toward the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the left, I saw a faint pinkish glow coming from just inside of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It travelled along the beach, remaining in the cloud cover, going very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The really weird part of this was that it remained just inside of the clouds the entire way - going out to sea in the middle, and back inland as it passed by the right.  It seemed to want to stay inside the clouds, and it also seemed to pick up speed as it passed by to the right.  In my notes, I wrote down that the speed was &#34;scary!&#34;  Both the surf and wind were very loud, so that was all I heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second sighting: ~11:50pm -------------------------- I was still on the balcony watching the clouds roll in.  At this point, they were more choppy.  2 glowing oval objects flew from behind me out to sea and eventually disappeared into the oncoming clouds.  I saw no structure, only glowing ovals - each about the size of nickel at arm&#39;s length.  They were flying together, yet independently.

I wanted to stop and take a longer look but I couldn&#39;t do so as I was on the highway. I continued driving and a few minutes later I turned into my housing estate and as I reached the guard house entrance, I asked one of the security guards if he had also saw the lights (All of them were gazing at the sky and talking excitedly among themselves). He said yes and I took the opportunity to stop by the roadside to take a longer look at the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I had described earlier, there were probably 10 to 20 bright flickering orange lights. Each one was roughly the size of a rice bowl and they were scattered across the clear night sky. After not more than 4 minutes, these lights began fading away one by one.<n>

My wife and I are on the patio watching the sky for satellites. I see what appears to be a satellite traveling west to east which is rare in our area. Then, I notice what appears to be another satellite following the first - but it seems to be catching up to the first, then backing off. After these &#34;satellites&#34; disappeared, we watched as 10-15 red objects about the size and shape of a match head held at arms length came into view exactly over our house flying looping and curling patterns from roughly SW to NE. There was no sound and the objects appeared to be relatively high - over 20K-30k feet. These objects were followed through the sky by 4 larger round discs flying straight and parallel from SW to NE. The red objects moved around the discs in varying patterns of loops and curves. Again, no sound. We waited to post our sighting hoping to see other reports in the paper or media to confirm what we saw but none have appeared. What an airshow! Absolutely the most amazing sight we have ever witnessed.<n>

I was stand on the porch of the motel I was staying at. The porch has a clear view to the W through NNW. I was looking in a WNW direction when I saw three bright white lights in a triangular shape or formation. I estimate these lights to be 1/2 of a mile from my location. The lights appeared to be moving in a NW direction at the speed of a small aircraft (120 kts or less.) They were at about 20 degrees above the horizion. As the light were moving away from me The front light went put. I don&#39;t know if this due to the light being turn off or if it became obstructed by part of the craft. I can not say this was one craft or three as it was to dark to see. The lights disappeared behind a hill to my NW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no noise from these lights. The morning air was still and quite, no dogs, no birds and no traffic noise that could have covered the sound of an aircraft engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The dam located not far from my location is a hydroelectric dam.

9/13/02 02:00|Loris|SC|Unknown|10 minutes-3 hours|Awakened by white light door opens memory goes blank woke/sat up 2 aliens by door paralyzed me blacked out|6/20/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110328.html|206|ndxe200209| Awakened by white light door opens memory goes blank woke/sat up 2 aliens by door paralyzed me blacked out<n> <n><n> <n><n> An intensely bright white light, like a lightning flash type of light except continuous, shined in through my window and woke me up.  The light then began to shine in through my door from our hallway inside, so I knew something had opened our house&#39;s front door because that was the only reason the light would be filling the inside of our house too.  My door then began to open, and my memory of what happened next isn&#39;t there.  I have no memory of what happened after my door opened or what opened it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing I remember is waking up in the most intense, raw terror I have ever experienced.  I was in a very deep sleep, and suddenly woke up out of it instantly sort of like waking up from a nightmare, only more intense and I had not been dreaming.  I sat up immediately when awakening in fear, and had &#34;sleep&#34; in my eyes that I began to rub out of my eyes as I noticed two figures standing by my door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This all happened within a second or so as I was awakening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw immediately the two figures were inhumanly tall, a bit taller than my door frame actually, so that they would have to duck to go through it.  They were about three to six inches taller than my door frame, which is average height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t see clearly immediately as I was awakening/ sitting up which is why I was rubbing the sleep out of my eyes, and to my absolute horror I realized standing by my door face to face were two beings people call aliens or greys.  I couldn&#39;t believe it because I was a fundamentalist Christian and did not believe aliens or greys were real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two greys seemed to have been standing in my room to make sure I didn&#39;t wake up and interrupt something else other greys were doing somewhere else in the house or outside.  They seemed to have been standing at my door face to face as if they were having a conversation like people, but I observed no noise nor did their necks seem nearly thick enough to contain vocal organs of any kind.  I did notice one make a gesture with its hand towards the other, which seemed to be somewhat like gestures people make to each other while talking, but I am not sure if that&#39;s what it was or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do think the two greys were communicating when I woke up, but I think they were communicating without using vocal organs to make noise like we do. I think it was some other form of communication, perhaps done through technological implants, eye lenses, or something like that.  I would find it hard to believe they have any kind of psychic telepathic communication abilities though like some people might start to think about when hearing the idea of non-verbal communication.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their appearance shocked me because I would have expected greys to be grey-green or green, but they were grey-blue.  They actually had a very bluish appearance to them. They had some sort of glow around them which was also blue.  The only way I know to describe it is a &#34;light fog&#34; that looked like &#34;curving light.&#34;  They didn&#39;t seem to have any clothes on but it might have just been hard to tell since there was some somewhat translucent light around them, and they could have been wearing something that kind of blended in with their bodies and skin. I tend to think they probably did have something on since I noticed no sexual organs or holes in general, aside from nostrils and mouths.  I saw no ears or holes similar to ears.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were hairless, or extremely close to being hairless, earless, and had very small, insignificant mouths with no lips or extremely small lips. They didn&#39;t really have noses, just kind of a very small nose-like nostril structure on their face kind of like how greys are usually depicted. Their eyes were gigantic, and the usual almond shape. I would say their eyes were a bit bigger than dinner plates. They were solid black, although I suspect the solid black might have been some kind of advanced lens they wear over their eyes. They had no eyelids, eyebrows, or bony indentation ridge like we have over our eyes. The eyes were rounded towards the top right corner of their heads, with the points of their eyes coming together near their nostrils. Their chins were pointed. Their heads were about two to three times larger than our heads, but the overwhelming majority of their heads is taken up by their huge eyes I would guess because that&#39;s at least how they look externally. Their ! eyes are so big that I don&#39;t think their brains could be much bigger than our brains actually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were disturbingly thin. They were so thin in fact that I wondered how their tiny necks, probably about the size of a human wrist or forearm, could hold up their huge heads. I think balancing their heads probably helps their small necks to deal with the weight. Their arms and legs were also extremely thin, much thinner than human arms and legs. Despite them being two to three feet taller than humans, I would think it&#39;s possible they probably weigh around the same as the average human because they&#39;re so much thinner than us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their torsos were not very big either, nor very muscular. They seemed to have extremely little muscle compared to humans. Or very little organs in general. They seemed to have a rib cage structure and backbone structure, along with hips, a pelvis, knees, etc.., similar to us. It seems like it could be somewhat different, but not dramatically different. They move in similar ways to us, like elbows and knees bend the same ways for example. The bone structure in their neck is definitely in the back just like ours. They have a skull in their head just like us. They have shoulders and a clavicle like us. They might have 6 fingers and 6 toes, but I&#39;m not really sure. Their fingers were longer in proportion to their bodies than ours, so it kind of made them hard to distinguish from each other, making seeing the number of them more difficult. I&#39;m not sure if I saw 6 fingers or just 5 long very thin fingers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their skin seemed different than ours. It&#39;s hard to describe exactly though. It seemed greyish-bluish in color, and perhaps to excrete more than our skin, but at the same time more &#34;rubbery&#34; than our skin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their mannerisms were just like machines or robots, which was one of the most terrifying and disturbing aspects about them and the experience. I would expect about as much mercy, feeling, caring, or compassion from them as I would from a machine; none. However, they also have an extreme intelligence that made me feel like a bug around a human, which makes me think that while they may not have emotion like we do, they&#39;re probably likely to be smart enough to make the right decisions. They actually turned and walked single file one behind the other just to walk over to me when I woke and sat up in my bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I sat up in my bed they somehow instantly paralyzed me, which was insanely and indescribably terrifying. It was like they were jamming my nervous system remotely  by will somehow, which is why I think they have technological implants inside their nervous system or brain, or something like that. I tried with all my might to scream for help, but my voice was paralyzed too. It felt like my throat was so dry that I couldn&#39;t make any noise. I also tried as hard as I could to move my legs and arms, but the best I could do was get some of my fingertips to barely drag across my bed sheets... a feeling I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I couldn&#39;t move or scream, when the one in front got close enough to me to reach towards me, I blacked out. I don&#39;t know if it made me black out or if I passed out from terror.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was all I remembered from the experience, just the beginning with my door opening, and waking up after they had placed me back in my bed, which was an accident, showing they aren&#39;t perfect any more than humans are. I also have a strong feeling that they messed up something and hurt me during the time I can&#39;t remember, which caused me to have the intense terror that woke me back up. They also messed up by not erasing my memory of waking up before they left which makes me think they had taken me somewhere else, and could only do that where ever they had taken me. But they probably should have done that again to erase my memory of seeing them, yet they didn&#39;t showing they do make mistakes and screw up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was only 13 years old when this happened, and I was so traumatized from the experience that I had to sleep with a glass of water by my bed and my light on for at least several months afterwards.  The trauma and terror of the experience is truly indescribable because nothing else in this world can produce the same kind of trauma and terror. It isn&#39;t just like you&#39;re seeing a strange looking person or animal, it&#39;s like you&#39;re in the presence of something far more powerful than yourself.  Even though the two greys didn&#39;t really do much of anything during what I can actually remember, I could sense their extreme power and intelligence for some reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m unsure if they&#39;re hostile or friendly or neutral, but I tend to think they&#39;re probably neutral towards people, and probably just need something from us that we don&#39;t understand right now. They probably have no interest in disclosing their presence to us, and even if they did they&#39;re beyond our level right now so we wouldn&#39;t really be able to fully grasp them yet anyway. There wouldn&#39;t be much accomplished by them disclosing themselves to us except maybe some people would begin idolizing, obsessing over, worshiping, or studying them. And none of that would actually accomplish much because an ant might see a human, but it can never hope to understand a human really, at least with the way ants currently are.<n>

Black sky with many stars. Crystal clear view of object, that appeared to move smoothly, not fast, to various positions,couldn&#39;t predict what movement it would go. I was making my security rounds and the lights color is what made me look. I observed first stationary-type object but immediately it begun to move. It was easy to see the movementswhen I focused either side of object. This U.F.O. was over ocean water, appeared good distance from coast, approximately 1/2 mile off shore at probably a 90 degree angle, I had to look directly up, looking out at the ocean, to make a visual. I took my flashlight and clicked it of and on slowly and then rapidly. It seems as though the object would move, after the flashing of the light, I sent out to it. It appeared it was observing what I was doing. I originally observed the object for half an hour, then I reported the sighting to local police. A police officer came to my location and immediately saw the object. we walked to a darkened area of the inn and observed the U.F.O. moving and casting the white/reddish colors. He stated he would contact F.A.A. for any air traffic. The only air traffic was a plane I obseved at 3:15a.m. The police officer said he would go to the station for binoculors and try to observe object at a beach a couple miles down, because he said the object looked as if it was closer to that particular beach, in other words a better view. I contacted the night auditor and he saw the object. we watched it and it make movements.I will look for the craft tonight, at approximately 1:30a.m. It may return or it may not. All I know is I observed and had witnesses observe a U.F.O. roger.<n>

Ligh intensity did not deminish over 20 min of observation. Object appeared to hover but shift slightly in its position. As a comercial aircraft decended to the airport, object seemed to &#34;bob&#34; in the wake of the plane, but it also did not seem to be relativly near the plane, perhaps this was just light defraction. Object appeared to hover over the campus of WSU, but could have been much further away. There was only one object, shape unknown. I am a research technician at Washington State University, I am 35 years old, maried, and I have never seen anything like this. At first I thought the object was a military aircraft, or helicopter, but after it hovered for 20 min, I was certain it was no airplane. The next morning the University network was not functioning in the AM..perhaps unrelated.<n>

After a while the two lights stopped the vertical motions, and began moving around very slowly (independently) but still staying close together.  No fast motions, but they would move, stop abruptly and pause, move somewhere else, then stop...<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for about 5-10 minutes.  My view was not extremely close, but they seemed to be much closer than high-flying commercial aircraft, and they were further out horizontally from my view than vertically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Description of lights: . Each was triangular.<n> <n><n> <n><n> . Entire triangle was red (no other external lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> . Color was very deep red, deeper than lights on large tv/radio antenna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> . Lights slowly pulsated in intensity (brighter-dimmer, ~2-3 second period).<n> <n><n> <n><n> . Lights did not seem to be directional.  No matter which way they moved, the lights did not stop showing (as plane lights would as the plane turned).<n> <n><n> <n><n> . Motion was not fast, but not extremely slow either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2nd sighting of the night: -------------------------- I was so edhilerated/excited/scared/blown away by the first sighting that I was not about to go back in the room if I could catch another glimpse of these things.  My patience paid off at ~10:15pm local time.  Again, two of the pulsating red triangles came into view - this time from my left.  They went back out to approx. the same spot they were in last time.  Their motions were the same as the first time, short and straight paths, abrupt stops, nothing too fast about any of it.  Moving independently, but staying relatively close to each other.  After 10-15 minutes of this, they began a slow steady path to my left with no abrupt stops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the last I saw of them for the trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other details: -------------- . I was staying at a hotel on the 6th floor which allowed me to see over some of the haze that was coming in from storm Hanna.<n> <n><n> <n><n> . Ft. Walton Beach is located between 2 U.S. Air Force bases - Eglin and Hurlburt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was doing some work for my company  at one of them.  I wanted so badly to ask people at the base the next day about experimental aircraft in the area, but I was representing my company and could not go around asking about glowing red pulsating triangles flying about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> . I watched the skies every evening for the rest of the trip (when not working).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw airplanes and helicopters fly over at other times.  Each of them was clearly a helicopter or airplane no matter how far away it was.  I am absolutely certain that the red triangles were not planes or helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The characteristics of their lighting and motion were not even close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> . I am providing a sketch of the scene since I did not have a camera. The sketch is not perfect, but I believe it depicts the important aspects of the scene.  (it may be a little dark, turn up brightess and contrast for best view).<n> <n><n> <n><n> . I saw nothing else this night, but the next night (9/13/02) I saw some even more amazing craft.  These sightings are reported separately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides illustration of sighting.  We may post it.  PD))<n>

I notice 5 objects that were larger than stars or planets all lined up vertically.  There were also 2 moving objects approaching the other 5.  These objects remained in my vision for over half an hour.  I believe if they had been jets or planes they would have dissapeared from view sooner.  These objects were all bright and standing out in a mainly clear and bright sky.  I also saw a black helicopter without lights on traveling toward objects.<n>

Height estimate is based on height of constant overhead airplane traffic over Omaha which I would imagine to be at roughly 37,000 feet. The object remained stationary for over 45 minutes when another appeared next to it. Spherical, I believe, but too far up to discern any details at all. It looked like a star. The 2nd object appeared and moved away from the other over the course of 10 minutes. I later heard the news of the &#34;new moon&#34; or &#34;space junk&#34; which had found orbit around Earth. Perhaps this is it. The sun at these times is 2 hours or so from setting, and it would reflect on this object. The skies were very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it again today, 09/16/02 in a slightly different location, and I captured about 20 minutes of it on VHS videotape.

It was moving to my right across the sky at a steady pace. It was definitely close enough to where I could discern that it was not an airplane. About the size of my index finger at arm&#39;s length. There were no wings or tail like an airplane. We watched it for a few moments before it went behind some trees and disappeared from our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

9/12/02 14:15|Dennis|MA|Other|5-10 seconds|Gray, faceted craft seen moving south over Route 6 in broad daylight.|9/13/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25030.html|218|ndxe200209| Gray, faceted craft seen moving south over Route 6 in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a student at the local community college, and during my drive home one afternoon, two things struck me as odd, one being a black helicopter that flew over my campus at or near 14:00pm, and the other being the fact that either a second, or the same helicopter was hovering approximate 100 to 200 feet above tree level between 5 and 10 miles away from the campus 10 minutes down Route 6.  I spotted the helicopter before I reached exits 9A and 9B, and found it to be hovering between exits 9A and 10.  I believe the town would have been Dennis, or extreme western Brewster near Underpass road.  For at least 5 minutes I could make out the helicopter hovering perfectly still in this same spot at this same altitude, and this seemed strange to me in broad daylight with little apparent reason for its presence.  However, not far down the road, perhaps just before Exit 10, on the horizon, (I was headed East on Route 6 during this whole event) I saw an oddly shaped craft that I first assumed was a fighter jet.  This wouldn&#39;t be out of the question given that one of the largest Air Force bases in the Northeast is on Cape Cod.  However, the lack of any sound, the velocity, and size of the craft did not match up for what would be a fighter plane, and since there was no airport in the immediate vicinity, its altitude seemingly ruled out the possibility that it was a plane at all.  I immediately thought back to the helicopter, and wondered if perhaps it had been observing the same thing I did because it seemed to be in an awful hurry when I first saw it in Barnstable (the town, not the county) and it was headed in the exact direct (or very near to) the spot where I saw it.  This lead me to believe that it wasn&#39;t a plane at all, and that, even if I sounded completely crazy, I should tell someone what I saw in hopes of finding some simple explaination.  I&#39;ve not contacted any authorities on the subject because I feel as though security may be so tight that no information may be had on the matter at all given the proximity! to the anniversary of 9/11.  The object I saw was moving south slowly at what must not have been much more than 300 to 500 feet above the ground, perhaps even less. It appeared to be metallic, but did not shine, which as I think about it, is rather odd given the lighting conditions (the sun was behind me shining directly on the object I witnessed)  It was a matte gray color, much like the paint job on a fighter jet (hence my original confusion) and did not have a memorable shape or profile other than being long and giving the impression that it had facets, or was possibly even a delta wing of some sort like the F-117, however this aircraft is not gray, so I knew it could not have been what I saw.  It also was not a blimp, because it was too small and moved to fast, besides being the entirely incorrect shape, and was not single-engine plane of any sort, as it was too large, and did not have any of the recognizable features that a plane of this type would possess.  Any information on this would settle my mind a great deal.<n>

My direction was north. I noticed a tremendous light reflection in the sky ahead. The shape was cigar/disk-like. What I remember was that this light was so bright it was painful to look at,almost like what a solar eclipse. Putting on sunglasses, I then saw the shape and noted that this craft was traveling west. The size was approximately half of my outstretched thumb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling in a line of traffic, so I was unable to keep track of the craft once it went behind trees after a minute. It was the brightest thing I&#39;ve ever seen...brighter than the sun.<n>

This took place 14 kilometres from the City, 2 kilometres from the major international airport. I am NOT a nutjob and I have a life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had dropped my cousin back off at his house by the beach after a dinner party,  approx.3am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he was unlocking the door and turning off the alarm I had gone around to the back of the building to empty a somewhat full bladder into the sand dunes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked up at the stars (as you do) there appeared to be oval shaped glowing ball of gas within a kilometre away. It appeared to be about 100 metres across ( hard to tell ) and was very bright red/orange colour, about half a kilometre off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this stage I had blinked several times and looked from the sky to the ground and back again to check my eyesight. When I realised that it was actually there I yelled to my cousin to come and have a look outside. When he did, I directed his attention upward to which he yelled at the top of his voice &#34;What the hell is that?&#34; Within about one minute of us standing there watching this solidly defined shape, it emitted a very thin beam of light straight down from the middle of the object to the ground, (the focal point of the beam at this time was obscured to us by the sand dunes).  There was no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My cousin, gamer than I, scrambled up the sand dunes to see where the light beam was going/coming from? Originally we thought the beam was coming from ground. By the time my cousin had beckoned me up onto the dunes I noticed that the light was coming from the shape overhead as it ended on the beach sand with no accountable light source in sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched this oddly for about five minutes, the beam of light stopped abruptly and the once defined ball of gaseous orange/reddish thing slowly over a period of about thirty seconds, dissipated from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I state, big believer in we are not alone in the universe, ( considering its size), NOT a believer in little green men coming to visit us. I presume some form of  atmospheric gas occurrence is responsible, just what kind and how.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very very similar sounding to the gentleman&#39;s experience in Tyrone,PA.<n>

It seemed to be Invisible. The only way I could tell that it was there, is because I could see the space around it glowing a bright white/blue. There were no lights, no jet trails, and no sound. It was moving quite fast, and disappeared behind a house after I got a glimpse of it. My friend that got a better look at the thing claimed that it was going about mach 5, I couldn’t&#39; tell the actual speed, but it was very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I explained to another friend what had happened, and he suggested that it was probably &#34;cloaked&#34; like &#39;Predator&#39;, or a &#39;Klingon&#39; spaceship&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 20 year old College student, and the other witness is a 23 year old Cook at a local restaurant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It seemed to be round diffused light with a tiny bright possible light source. It was very bright and seemed to be traveling at about the speed of what an airplane might be traveling when it was approaching a runway for a landing. Having only seen this object for a couple of seconds, I&#39;m only guessing at its size and altitude.  It seemed quite low and I&#39;d estimate its diameter to be the size of the length of a private single engine airplane. It had no defined edges as the edges were more or less glowing similar to what a bright light bulb might look like from a distance.  I live approximately 2-3 miles from the edge of Lake Michigan and the &#34;craft&#34; was flying from the East to the West which is the direction of Lake Michigan from my home.  Interestingly enough, and the reason for my filing out this report, someone that I work with saw something the same night down in the Douglas, Michigan area. Her discription was nearly identical to mind.  Same bright, large object moving from the East toward Lake Michigan. She also lives quite close to Lake Michigan.  She had another experience in the past, but I don&#39;t think that it was very recent, but it did involve a &#34;craft&#34; over the Lake Michigan area shoreline down in Douglas, Michigan.  Douglas and Norton Shores are probably 55 miles from one another.  I have never seen anything like this in my life and my first thought was that whatever this was was heading downward toward the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

At first I thought it was light from the type of searchlight that bars or clubs may occaisionally use, and I kept watching for it to come around again, but it did not. Maybe two minutes after this, a triangular formation of three lights came into view, travelling incredibly fast from NNW to SSE. It was probably only about six seconds from the time they came into view from over the roof of my  North-side neighbour&#39;s garage until they passed out of view behind the roof of my South-side neighbours house. I would estimate this to offer me a view of sixty to seventy percent of the sky along the flight path. I did not see any metallic type of craft, only three distinct, equally bright lights that were a dull yellow colour, and not sharp, but rather fuzzy, as if slightly out of focus.(Perhaps I should mention that I was only drinking bottled water). Each light was, I would guess, to be about the size of a dime if I were holding it at arm&#39;s length, spaced about triple that length apart, with the two trailing lights about sixty degrees off from the leading light. It passed over without making any discernible sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

They moved soundlessly as far as I could tell, passed behind a fig tree in my backyard, and I did not see them reemerge from behoind the tree. They were colored a sort of greyish color that was about the color that most clouds appear at night, but these were moving far faster and in a different manner than any cloud that I have ever seen. There were no lights that I saw just a solid looking grey color on the ovals. I have lived close to an airport almost all of my life and have a passing familiarity with what planes look and sound like at night. I can&#39;t remember seeing a plane at night that close to an airport with no obvious lights anywhere on it let alone four. They were planes taking off and coming into the airport not too long before or after my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting took place over the course of no more than 15 or so seconds. This may sound strange but the shapes seemed to be almost two dimensional, but that is merely a personal opinion.(And I don&#39;t mean I think they came from the 2nd demension I mean they seemed to posess no depth.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the description provided by the witness is not inconsistent with a sighting of laser-based advertising lights.  However, that is a guess.  PD))<n>

I was coming up over a small pass about 12 miles North of Reno on Hwy 395, just before the Cold Springs exit when I saw a very large bright red light very low in the sky.  It was flashing and moving very fast.  I was so focused on the light I did not see anything else.  At first I thought a helicopter was landing on the freeway, then I thought no way, as the light was huge, moving to fast and there was absolutely no sound.  The lights flashed across the freeway and up the side of Peavine mountain and disappeared.  It happened so fast I did not see anything but the light.<n>

It was no millitary aircraft i had ever seen. it looked a star destroyer from star wars but it was black. it was going extremely fast, it elevated and flew over the plane, and then sped away.

What I was seeing was three small white starlike lights just moving across the sky just like satellites do but in a perfect triangle form.

9/10/02 18:57|Coronado|CA|Light|20 minutes|A bright, 3-4" in diameter light moving in a circle, changing directions and turning into two eyes focussing on me!|10/28/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25799.html|236|ndxe200209| A bright, 3-4&#34; in diameter light moving in a circle, changing directions and turning into two eyes focussing on me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in a swing in my back yard, reading the newspaper. (There is a high 8 ft. fence on alley and next door house; garage and back of house make up other two sides).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement of a light.  This light was about 3-4 inches in diameter, single light, moving in a slow circle; my left to my right side.  I looked up to see if there was an airplane/ helicopter, or anything shining into the backyard.  No!  I got up from the swing, and went to the top of 4 stairs to see if anyone was focussing a mirror into the backyard, or using a blashlight, or checking me out with binoculars.  No to the top of four stairs to see if someone (from the Condos across the alley) was focussing a mirror into the backyard, or using a flashlight or checking me out with binoculars.  No! I sat back down and watched this light move around in a slow circle, about 3 feet from the swing.  I watched for about 5-10 minutes.  What caught my interest is: at the time of the day, on daylight time, this part of the yard, garage are in shade.  This light then srarted out of it&#39;s circle -- going left to right, across a wooden trellis fencing on the side of the house (3 feet high) and continuing .  Then this light deviated and started back right to left, then changing back and I was focused on it totally, as this circle stopped at 2 of my potted plants, with herbs in them, and then continuing on.  What REALLY caught my interest was when this light started out of it&#39;s circle and begin to enter the open garage side door.  The light changed tactics and moved two feet of the left of this garage door, and two (2) prominent eyes shaped like oblong spheres, stopped and looked directly at me.  During this time of my concentration and these eyes looking at me I felt a sense of uneasiness, as if those eyese were assessing me.  I later said to myself....&#34;It was like a Mexican Stand-off&#34;!  I have no idea how long these eyes focused on me!  And suddenly the eyes, the light was gone!  I will say again, that this part of the garage/yard were in complete shade.  There is a rather large tree in the corner of this backyard that shades this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About myself.  I am 72 years old, a college graduate, and a former teacher.  I have never particularly been interested in UFO&#39;s or read much about them.  I know what I saw, and I can&#39;t explain it.  I did take a copy of my email to my son, down to the local Fire Department.  I talked to the Assistant Fire Chief, and left a copy of my email to my son with him.  I have recently completed what is known as a class in &#34;Community Emergency Response Team&#34; which necessitated taking over a month&#39;s training in Disaster Preparedness, as one focus.  Unfortunately, after I had visited this Assistant Fire Chief, someone from that office, called my son, whose&#39;s telephone number was on his business email address.  Basically, the call was to alert my son, that I was &#34;spreading rumors about this town,and this person thought my son should know what I was doing!  The idead!  If I had listened to my son, and his bridge buddies (many of whom are former teachers in this town), I would have published that email in the local newspaper.  I&#39;m sure that would have raised some eyebrows!!!!!  Incidentally, I said, as I prefaced my talk to this Assistant Fire Chief....&#34;I have an FBI clearance, and I am not a nut case&#34;.<n>
9/10/02 16:30|Mount Shasta (near)|CA|Light|5 minutes|Mount Shasta light phenomena observed in brightly lit meadow in broad daylight for 5 minutes|9/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25106.html|237|ndxe200209| Mount Shasta light phenomena observed in brightly lit meadow in broad daylight for 5 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a single stationary light change from red to orange to yellow to green and finally blue. This occurred in a brightly lit meadow near the summit of Mt. Shasta at about 4:30 in the afternoon. The light was intense, pure, and very small (about dime sized). It appeared in front of the trunk of a Spruce tree not more than 100 feet away, slightly above head level (about 6 feet up). The light would slowly transition from one solid color to the next, and then it would remain an intensely bright pure color for about a minute before slowly transitioning to the next color. I approached the tree and examined the trunk, limbs and foliage. I could find nothing that could have emanated that sort of light. I toyed with the idea of pitch oozing slowly out and while solidifying changed the reflected color, but the pitch I observed was cloudy white and in huge dried clumps. The pitch was to the right of the location of the light I pinpointed while using binoculars (I observed the light with the naked eye and binoculars). I had a camera and didn&#39;t use it; I couldn&#39;t see the light in the viewfinder. The light could only be viewed in one direction, and as I approached the tree, the light would disappear. I have no idea of where the source of the light was in relation to the distance between me and the tree except that it was in front of the trunk about 6 feet above ground level as viewed from ground level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT BY SAME WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> With regard to the lights on Shasta, unfortunately I have no theories as to what the lights were. Here is the whole boring story:<n> <n><n> I was asleep in the meadow when I opened my eyes to find a red light shining into them. I closed my eyes, thinking &#34;Oh its just a reflection from tensile on the tree&#34;, thinking better of that, I reopened them to find the light changing from red to orange. I sat up and thought that was strange. When I sat up the light disappeared, so I lay back down and discovered that the light was directional. I had to be careful how I moved to keep the light in view. The &#39;now orange&#39; light was intense and pure and I couldn&#39;t write it off as a reflection. I stared at it for awhile, enjoying the beauty of it; then it started transitioning to yellow. Well that really piqued my curiosity. As the light grew in intensity and purity to a very bright lemon<n> <n><n> yellow, I took out my binoculars and isolated the position on the tree where it appeared to be coming from. I stood up to investigate but discovered that I was ill. I had a hard time going to the tree as waves of nausea were sweeping over me. As I approached the tree, I lost sight of the light as I was no longer in it&#39;s line of site, for the moment I was sure that an examination of the tree would yield the answer. At the tree, I couldn&#39;t find anything that could cause it except for maybe pitch, but the pitch was in the wrong location and none of it was fresh. I went back to my original position on the ground and found the light transitioning from yellow to green. I admired the green light for awhile and tried to take a picture of it, since I couldn&#39;t find it in the viewfinder I gave up. I tried again to find the source, to no avail. When I returned again to my original position, the light had transitioned to blue. Again I tried to approach the tree this time keeping the light in sight, but as soon as I&#39;d get close, I&#39;d loose the light. When I returned to the original position to regain it, the light was gone. Although I said the whole thing lasted 5 minutes, it could have been longer.  I had time to sit and stare at it, take out binoculars and stare at it, run back and forth to the tree, and finally tried to get a picture of it. The camera I had was just a digital camera-not my camcorder. My camcorder would have been able to zoom in on the light no problem as it has a fantastic zoom. The camera I had with me doesn&#39;t have a very good zoom. I regret that I didn&#39;t take pictures anyway, as it may have shown up in the picture. At this point, my guess would be pretty far out at to what it could be. I have the impression that some unseen person or thing was standing there shining lights in my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END FOLLOW-UP))<n>

Shortly before the Villlage of Oak Creek my 10 year old son who was in the back seat said &#34;What is that thing in the sky?&#34;.  I said it was probably a plane but he seemed insistent so I strained my neck to look where he was pointing.  At that time I noticed what appeared to be a shiny metallic-like object that seemed to be halfway between a round and disc shape.  It was high in the sky, about where a small plane would normally fly.  It was not moving, just hovering.  As the road I was on is very winding I couldn&#39;t keep my eyes on it for very long at a time.  My son, however continued to observe it for at least 4 minutes.  It didn&#39;t appear to do anything except hover high above the rocks until I looked up the last time.  Then it appeared to get physically smaller and smaller over a period of about 15 seconds until it completely disappeared.  Shortly after this I stopped in the Village of Oak Creek to get a coffee, all the while marveling with my son over what we had just seen.  After about 5 minutes we proceeded to get back on the road at which time my son said &#34;There is is again&#34;.  It had moved position slightly and seemed a bit lower this time.  A jet plane flew almost directly over it at that time and it gave us a bit of perspective as to the size.  It seemed to be about a quarter of the size of a large plane.  Once again, it just hovered and did not make any movements. (or sound that we could tell)  We continued to watch it for another 3 or 4 minutes (myself in between looking at the road of course)and because of the enormous rocks and cliffs around Sedona we then lost sight of it.  UFO sightings around Sedona are known to be a bit &#34;common&#34;.  I have personally seen many &#34;strange&#34; lights in the night sky but have never seen anything during the day. I am a professional singer in Phoenix but I also work at a mortgage company in Sedona during the week.<n>

It was a full moon and I stepped out on my cement patio to feel the cool air. My dogs were up along the fence making their usual last leg lift before coming inside to sleep. They sleep inside because there are coyotes in the neighborhood. I live 15 miles north and a little east of town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was bright out and while reaching for a chair I looked down on the white cement and noticed a shadow.  It was round.  I looked up and there was nothing up there to be its cause.  I looked on the roof -- perhaps a round object was up there that I didn&#39;t know about and it was casting a shadow down on the cement.  Nothing on the roof. I looked in the black Locust tree, maybe there was a round nest up there and it was casting a shadow. All I saw was the shape of the tree and a little light coming through branches. It was bright out and I looked up a little to the left of the only tree in my yard.  The moon was there a minute ago and it wasn&#39;t. There was no moon -- In the strangeness of the moment, I didn&#39;t put that piece into the puzzle until it was all over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not frightened.  I looked back down at the round shadow on the patio.  Still there and it was about ten feet in diameter.  I know because after the event I ran into the house and got a tape measure. But I&#39;m getting ahead of myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again I tried to find an overhead cause for the shadow on the patio and I was looking up and around and I noticed one of my dogs was watching something up in the sky.  Every so often he would jump into the air like he was trying to catch something. I walked around looking up and I walked into the shadow and watching my shadow emerge when I stepped back out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood quietly for maybe 45 seconds and I kept my eyes on it.  I watched the shadow as it started to move across the patio.  The one older dog, laying near my feet, jumped up and ran into the house and the other dog &#34;followed&#34; the shadow across the yard -- jumping up and down barking. I remember looking all around when it starte to move and I remember seeing the moon, and the shadow slowly moved off the patio down to the ground and the black circle moved slowly across the light colored sand.  I was walking behind it and I could see my shadow to my left - on the left side of the shadow.  The silent invisible round what-ever picked up speed, a perfect circle was right there to see and follow and I would have, but I was stopped by my fence.  I watched it grow larger as it slithered across the yard and into the street.  It was heading west north west.  And then my dog stopped barking and leaping into the air and the shadow that had been on my patio for no more than two or three minutes had moved up and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Obviously when I first looked up at the full moon it wasn&#39;t there because the invisible round craft was between eleven and twelve o&#39;clock position in the night sky and it was blocking my direct line of sight.  It blocked the shape of the moon but the object in front of the moon gave itself away by casting a shadow on my patio.  And I think it was close, maybe 50- 80 feet over my head (?) and that is why my dog was leaping into the air trying to catch it --- it was close enough to his senses to &#34;leap up and catch.&#34;  I saw nothing but a round shadow on the ground and I saw nothing to be the cause. The sky looked bright and normal for a full moon out in the country.  No light pollution.   There was no sound except my dog barking and just one other thing.  When I went inside to get the tape measure, I noticed my five Koi were racing around their pond. As usual their covered porch, shades drawn, was in the dark and they should have been sleeping.  How did they know there was a noiseless invisible, shadow casting, intruder?  And why were they, and one dog upset, and I wasn&#39;t?<n>

I was looking toward the South when I saw it.  It was a very very bright white light - in fact I thought at first it was a meteor, but then I realized it was going at a slight incline.  It appeared for a moment as a bright streak then went completely out, then on the same trajectory appeared again a little further toward the West and went out again. I had called to my husband when I saw the first streak as he was on the porch and he ran out in the yard and saw it when it reappeared for the third time and then went out.  We searched the sky to the West and it never reappeared that we could see.  It was traveling much much faster than an airplane (even a fighter jet) and there was no noise.

Highliner Lobsterman, member of the 2 million trap club. Born ((date and place deleted))<n> <n><n> On September ninth at approx. 19:10 hours EDST, while hauling gear on the continental shelf 125KM East, Southeast of Nantucket Mass. I overheard a radio<n> <n><n> transmission originating from the vessel &#34;Flight&#34;, made to the U.S. Coast Guard group Moriches, Long Island, New York. The master of the sailing vessel &#34;Flight&#34;, attracted my ears to pay attention; by hailing the universal distress code &#34;Mayday&#34;. I immediately followed the channel shift to Channel 22 alpha, which is a standard Coast Guard working frequency.  The master of the sailing vessel &#34;Flight&#34;, initially established his line of work, and also the fact that he was in the company of a veteran pilot with thirty years experience. To the best of my recollection, he reported seeing a silver cigar shaped instrument, fly in from the North, heading South, at approximately an altitude of two to three thousand feet, stop, and turn<n> <n><n> due east, and propel itself out of visual range at an astonishing speed. I was listening<n> <n><n> intently to this conversation as I often due to interesting FM radio conversations. The one thing that struck me, is that, being the sensitive individual that I am, and having monitored countless thousands if not hundred of thousands of Radio conversations over the years, I could not help but sense the fear in his voice. This certainly did startle me.  I have a wordly mind, but had never actually heard anything quite so peciuliar. If anyone would like to talk with me about this, I can be reached through this agency.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length on two occasions with this individual, and found him to be exceptionally credible.  He is a long-time boat skipper.  We express our gratitude to him for taking the time to submit the report.  PD))<n>

I loked up to see the load being placed on the roof when I saw the craft. It looked at first like a big peice of paper floating in the sky then it stoped moving and just hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at the about the same altitude as pasenger planes fly over that area. Next the craft started making realy quick movments and stoping.This is when I said something to the crane operator. He got out of the crane and I told him to look up in the sky and, verify what I was seeing. At first he said it was a plane. Then the craft started make the realy quick movments again. The crane operator then said that is no plane! And I do not even want to know what it is. We watched tthe craft for anther 5 minutes or so when the craft made realy big movment horizontialy. Just then another craft flew by the original craft and out of sight. The original craft made like a real quick circle and followed the other craft out of sight. I was i the military for 6 years and I never saw anything make that quick of a movment or fly that fast.<n>

I was struck by a dim moving shape coming from my left (that is from north). Though this is a quite inhabited area, the sky was very bright and the stars quite visible. It was a chevron formed by several dim lights (10 more or less), just like stars, but with a litlle less brilliance, moving together towards south (in between the lights it was plain black). It just moved slowly, and calculating through the angular disposition of the chevron, it was high in the sky, more or less at the same altitude as cruising airline airplanes . Nevertheless it had none of the usual characteristics of an airplane (no red or white flickering lights, which I usually see either in low altitude during landing procedures in the nearby airport, or at high altitude since in Lisbon it appears to exist an important radio reference). I noticed, however, that one of the snmall lights got out of the formation and disapeared. That is to say that I&#39;ve never seen nothing like it. Of course, it hadn´t any specularity. It continued to move slowly towards south (I thought to wake up my wife, but I knew that the shape would soon run out of view). And so it was, continuing to move southwards, till the cheveron lights disaparead due to the distance.No sound was heard. I wrote this description because it fits the report from Wisconsin the 5th September I&#39;ve just read.<n>

It was unlikely that it was a plane because of the way it disappeared and there was not a cloud in the sky.  The sky was clear.  Although I&#39;m willing to admit that it could have been my eyes playing tricks on me, I&#39;ve observed many a shooting star and it was very uncharacteristic.<n>

This craft traveled west down Williams Ave with no running lights  but dimmly lit light nodes were seen but they were Not Lit. The nodes were in the shape of the whole craft, triangle. Estimate amount of speed I would say 20 mph or faster. No noise was associated with the craft. I was completely surprised of this event and said why me. I have hosted a Ufo Television talk show for ten years of which Mr. Davenport has been a guest many times. I believe this was the true and real triangle craft. It was so completely unexpected yet there it was so close and so huge. I did not see a leading edge or rear of craft I just saw a triangle from the side and bottom of the ship. The sky was clear and about 70 degrees.<n>

So i went outside to look, and there it was . It was zooming down from the sky. It had 3 bright lights flashing. It went through the clouds, but you i could still see the lights. Then it stopped. It was wobbling. Then it looked like it was turning around, and as it did, there was a red flash of light on the side. Then a car came, and it went on its way then i went back inside all amazed. They really exist. they did that to let me know that its really happening. wow. It was amazing and beautiful at the same time.<n>

It was dark except for four white lights, 3 on one side and one in the &#39;back&#39;.  The lights slightly illuminated the edges of the craft and there was no strobe light.  I was quite interested in it, and even got my skeptic of a dad to look at it, and he had no idea what it was.  I watched as it flew in a curved path though the sky(&#39;front&#39; tip first), and the lights stayed steady.  There was no noise coming from it that I could hear.  It was visable for a few minutes before it was obscured by trees.<n>

The object moves slowly at first to the left than upwards and then fast back down only this time going to the right. I thought at lst it may be a satelite, but I don&#39;t believe that they can move this slow and then very fast, also why would there be the pulsating lights? I would appreciate it if someone can post a message as to what this may be. Thank you! P.S. The object was sited in the northeastern skies.<n>

Observer 1 I first saw what appeared to be a big star that was changing colors from red to blue to green,  Looking through the telescope, I saw a very deliberately shaped circle of thousands of light grids that were pulsing and rotating.  The colors were distinct, and some were indescribable. A significantly smaller round object was flying around the object in a random pattern, sometimes disappearing from view.  It was not star, and definitely a manufactured object.  Observer 2 When looking through the telescope, the colors I observed were indescribable. What I say may not make as much sense as I would like it to. The colors changed within an fraction of a second, and never slowed down pulsating. Each time it changed, it wasn&#39;t one solid color on the object. There were several colors on it, neons, at a time. ~ Observer 3<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star?

Because of the city lights and such it was not that great but as I was waiting for my turn I was walking around to the front of my house when I saw this lightthat  was shining down on the middle of the street. I took me a second to look up because i thought it was the street light, but when i did i saw a massive disk/saucer shape hovering about 100 or so feet in the air. It was maybe the size of a large house, but it was almost invisible due to it having no lights on it save for the one beam down to the road. I was stunned and ran around the house screaming to my friends to come see it. We all ran back around and we ALL saw it. As soon as i moved a bit closer and came out of the shadow of my house, the beam swung right on to me and locked on to me. I couldnt see anything because of the light but my friends said the ship suddenly had lights come up on the bottom and start pulsing red. Then the beam disappeared and the ship launched straight up in the air. That was the end. My hands are still shaking. I am writing this about half an hour or so after. I think the beam was analyzing me or scanning me.

They were moving parallel to one other, somewhat slowly, but steadily.  A minute or so after they disappeared from sight, I saw another similar object moving in approximately the same direction.  Shortly after that one disappeared, I saw another one moving in the opposite direction (the only one moving in that direction).  I saw a total of either six or seven objects, over about a fifteen minute period.  They did not move in an unusual way, they just looked different from anything I have seen.  At one point during my &#34;sighting&#34;, (I would guess the third or fourth object that I saw) the object appeared very bright, or reflective.  That brightness/reflectiveness lasted a few seconds.   And also, during this (approximate) fifteen minute time interval, I saw a military aircraft (dark gray in color) in the same general area of the sky in which these other objects were appearing.  A military maneuver of some kind??????  I am interested to know what these things were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke to this witness as length, and we found her to be exceptionally credible.  We do not know what it was she witnessed.  We know that the beach at Hilton Head, SC, has a high frequency of osprey birds (&#34;fish eagles,&#34;) but we seriously doubt whether the witness would have mistaken these birds for something other than what they are.

It was silver coloured and shaped somewhat like a disk or ellipsoid. As we are both aviation nuts, we attempted to identify it, but the combination of the odd shape and even stranger lighting pattern defied description. I clocked it at approximately mach 3 (2250 mph), which is well beyond the bounds of civil aviation. It then pulled up and lost speed faster than I have ever seen a human aircraft do. When it slowed to a stop, it simply slid backwards until it was behind a building in the distance. Obviously, this surpasses the capabilities of *any* human-built aircraft. It either landed or sped of at ground level, because we neither heard nor saw an impact or an explosion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As Abilene is the site of a major Air Force Base (Dyess), it would seem to be a logical place for any Extraterrestrial activity. Most of the United States&#39; B-1B &#34;Lancer&#34; High-Speed bombers are stored there. However, they have a max. speed of about mach 2, and are all painted dark brown. They are not a viable explanation exept perhaps as an attraction for Extraterrestrial attention.<n>

We were in Central Park in NYC and I was laying down in the shade looking straight up in to the sky. I noticed one object that looked to be circular and white, I thought it was a satellite or maybe a planet. I didn&#39;t think much of it until I noticed that it had not moved for several minutes. I pointed the object out to my friend and asked if it could have been the planet Venus since sometimes you can see it during the day and it obviously was not a satellite since it had not moved. As we were both discussing it we noticed that it had started to move. Then my friend pointed out another one in a different part of the sky. As we looked around we started to see more and more. We watched as the slowly moved in different directions and at one point three of the objects formed in a shape of a triangle (probably several miles apart) and then slowly moved back into a straight line and then went in completely different directions. The most interesting event was when one of the objects looked as though it completely changed form and turned from a sphere into a longer thinner object. This object moved at a high rate of speed across the sky in a movement that  could most closely be described as  &#34;sperm-like.&#34;  Due to it&#39;s speed, this object was only seen for about 45 seconds before it moved out of sight. The rest of the objects very slowly moved apart from each other or too high for us to see.  The final talley of the objects was eleven.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  We spoke with him over the telephone, and found him to be serious-minded and quite credible.  We encouraged him to try to get a photo the next time he watches something unusual for 1-2 hours.

There were three of us who observed the object. The object was black or silver.  At first we thought it was a kite or a balloon because it seemed to move only slowly.  The object seemed to wobble aerodynamically as the air went through it -- almost as if it was designed to move that way. It traveled in a straight line along the horizon above the trees.  We boarded the ferry and went upstairs to a window right away to continue watching the object.  At the speed it was moving, it should have still been there, however, it wasn&#39;t.  The day was clear, not cloudy or rainy.  There were no lights or sounds associated with the object.   We could not observe any windows or doors -- seemed liked one solid piece.<n>

Earlier in the evening (from 10 - 11pm) we watched an impressive display of the Northern lights. I fell asleep on the couch and awoke around 3am Sunday and decided to take my sleeping bag and pad onto the deck to fall asleep under the stars. While stargazing I noticed what appeared to me as a satellite tracking from south to north. Upon further observation I noticed that the object was being followed by two additional lights of the same size. All three were equidistant forming a very distinct triangle pattern. The lights were about 1.5 - 2x brighter than the surrounding stars. Lying on my back they appeared to be about one hand width distance from each other from my perspective. The lights were white only with no accompaning marker lights such as those on an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed binoculars from the house but was unable to focus on the target objects. I continued to follow the objects with my naked eye as they tracked steadily to the north. The lights held the distinct triangular pattern and faded into the horizon. I have seen many satellites in the past but never three in such a distinct formation. I became motivated to file this report after talking to several friends and realizing that it seemed quite odd for three satellites to be moving in what appeared to be formation. Additionally, I am accustomed to seeing satellites much earlier in the evening. An interesting side note is that after the sighting I observed two brief flashes, similar to a mirror at a great distance reflecting sunlight. The flashes were quite brief but 3-4x brighter than the stars. These occured about a minute apart from each other and were overhead in the area through which the objects had passed. At this point i was all set with skywatching for the evening and promptly closed my eyes and eventually drifted off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are aware of the U. S. Navy &#34;NOSS&#34; satellites which currently are in orbit, but they are not in a polar orbit, to the best of our knowledge.  Also, they probably would not be visible at 3:00 a.m., since they probably would be in the Earth&#39;s shadow at that time.  We do not know what the witness saw.  PD))<n>

The crafts had lights all around the outside of it. After hovering for the 3 or 4 minutes they simply took off at a speed that was indescribely fast. It was almost like they dissappeared because it was so fast. The crafts left a metallic colored trail behind them after they left.<n>

I literally had just taken my binoculars out (8x30) to just look at the stars. About maybe half a minute after I started, a very bright, well defined &#34;greenish-white&#34; light passed through my field of view, moving quickly, but steadily....not like an aircraft. I presumed it was a low orbiting satellite, but as I watched, it split into two distinct lights, one red, the other green. As I kept looking, the lights merged back into the original  &#34;greenish-white&#34; light originally spotted. I also thought it might be a fighter jet just banking with respect to my line of sight, but I would have seen the green (starboard) light first, then green and red, then back to green. The first, original color was a very pale green...almost white, the &#34;split color&#34; a much deeper green, (alot like a navigation light). The object travelled from northeast to southwest, and was spotted about 45 degrees up from the horizon to where I lost it over the house. No sound was heard during or after the object passed, and I listened for about 60 seconds afterwards in the event it was a high altitude jet. No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later, I heard what sounded alot like fighter aircraft flying high up. This sighting lasted about 10 seconds from when I caught it until I lost it. I even tried running around to the other side of the house to catch it again (judging from where I lost it) but to no avail.<n>

We were situated in our boat just above the Guntersville Dam on the Tennessee River.  My husband and I have both witnessed some unidentified objects in the sky and on the ground before, but we never really talk about them much until this weekend when something strange happened to us.  We were out at about 23:00 pm doing some catfishing.  We witnessed an object that appeared to be round fly across the sky just about 200 yards above some treetops.  It appeared to be comet-like in appearance but the trail it left behind did not fan out like most comets do.  By no means am I an expert, but I am quite sure this was not a comet.  It went horizontally straight across the sky above the treetops.  It appeared out of nowhere and continued for a long distance across the sky to only disappear in thin air.  It has an orange &#34;trail-like&#34; glow behind it, but the circular part up front did not appear to have any glow around it, it was just in front of this trail.  It was faster than any jet that we know of.  My hubby is an Army brat so he has seen a few up close up and personal.  There was NO sound whatsoever.  Okay, we were trying to convince ourselves that it must be a comet...however, it never descended toward Earth.  Then about 15 seconds later, ANOTHER one, but only this one came from below at the edge of the treetops and ascended into the sky.  It had a blue flame and it was almost on top of our heads when it appeared.  It had a shorter trip than the first one, but it was just as spectacular.  I have never seen a shooting star ascended from that far down into the sky and that quickly to boot.  I didn&#39;t think a comet could do that either.  Had we only seen the first one, we would have wrote the event off as being maybe a meteroid but the mystery was it remained completely horizontal across the sky to disappear as quickly as it appeared.  I would have thought had it been a co! met, we would have seen it coming from the distance and approach and then pass by.  The altitude at which this occurred seemed to be odd for a jet, but a jet cannot fly this fast.<n>

This was the last night of the Greer Groups (Cecti) stay.  We had been skywatching since sundown.   Just before 10:48 pm my wife said to me there were two lights traveling together.  Since I usually try and video anything unsual I found the two lights and started recording. Upon closer view with the camera I saw it was an elongated triangular formation of three lights. There was no moon or obstructions to the viewing. The formation was to our left and in the direction of James house west of us. My effort to capture the formation on video was sucessfull this time and I have a video of it.  The formation was heading from north to south and it was to the west of where we were. The lead light went out after a few seconds and the two trailing lights went out in approximately the same place.

The 4 light were same colors as a star would be. Think about it as 4 bright stars moving togheter at exactly the same speed. Speed was similar to a satellite speed. We are more then 10 witness and we were all struck that this was way to big to be one object and we could see the stars background so it was empty between the stars. The formation was a losange (french word for the shape) and the movement direction was inline with the shape (sorry for bad english!). It did not change direction or speed. Direction was approximately toward South East (i was visiting a friend so I cannot be precise on direction seems to me like SE). I have no explanation for this. I tough about 4 satellites in a formation with about a kilometer spread but i cannot figure how 4 satellites could be so bright and so well synchronized in this perfectly stable speed and shape. I guess they would not stay togheter like that but would rather spread apart. I&#39;m left with no explanation and I&#39;m not alone. Please tell me what it was! I cant stop thinking about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We recently have been made aware of four satellites that currently orbiting Earth, as part of a study to study the aurora borealis.

I then noticed that there were three objects in total, moving at the exact same velocity in a slightly elongated right triangle formation.  There was about 25 degrees of separation between the lead object and the others.  These objects did not move relative to each other, staying in perfect formation until they disapeared - first the lead object, then the two trailing objects about 1 second later.

I went in the house and got my binoculars and told my husband and 20 yr old daughter to come out and look.  Without binoculars it looked like a brilliant star.  But with binoculars there was a definite oval shape with individual spot lights around the perimeter that pulsated and changed to different colors.  The object tilted and it appeared to have a cone-like bottom.  It hovered in the NW sky for about 30 minutes and then slowly moved North and West.  I notified the police but by the time the officer arrived, it was out of view.  I called my friend in Hamlin, NY (about 10 miles NW of Rochester) and she and her husband went outside and saw SEVERAL ufo&#39;s in the NW sky.

I was driving with my 9 year-old daughter, down a dark country road (Chandler Road) in Mt. Juliet, TN (near Nashville).   We saw some large red lights (about the length of a school bus) hovering above the trees over a field.  We were unable to see the body of the craft because it was so dark.  I spotted it for about 5 seconds before I drove on past it.  Then it had ascended high into the sky extremely fast according to my daughter. My daughter had kept her eye on it the entire time until we got to her dad&#39;s house about 10 minutes later. (I was unable to because I was driving).  When we arrived she pointed it out to me.  To the naked eye it looked like a very bright star but red lights were twinkling.  We showed it to her dad also.  Through binoculars I saw a space ship.  It was a grey craft with a roundish-octagon shaped flat bottom with flashing red lights, and a domed top.. it was floating/hovering in the same general area for about 1 hour.  Her dad video taped it but he didn&#39;t have a tripod and the zoom is not as high-powered as the binoculars but he will submit it for your evaluation of it.<n>

Everyone was sitting around in a circle on the driveway, with me being the only one with a direct (I beleave easternly) view of the night sky.  I first became aware of the object as a firey streak in the upper perferial vision of my left eye.  Thinking it was a shooting star, I quickly looked up, and indeed saw what appeared to be a very brightly lit and slow moving shooting star, (about 4 - 5 times the speed of a jet seen flying at high altitude) leaving an endouring firey trail in its wake. Just as I was about to dismiss the event as an &#34;identified object&#34;, my shooting star executed a series of very quick and very tight course changes resembling the letter &#34;S&#34; just before vanishing, more like &#34;burning out&#34;. No one else seemed to see it, and I didn&#39;t mention it, knowing that most people do not respond with an open mind. I am a military member, who is accustomed to seeing all types of aircraft. I know what I saw.<n>

I stared at this light for about 5-6 minutes in the same fixed position and then I lost sight of it.  I could not find it for at least 2-3 minutes and then all of a sudden I see the same light in a slightly different position of the sky and a lot further away (much higher altitude).  The light was still reddish/orange but very small.  This time it seemed to move in a zig-zag pattern but not going in any particular direction.  I lost sight of it after about 15 minutes.  I went back to my computer wondering if it was a satellite or a bright planet/star - certainly was not an airplane. After maybe another 10 or 15 minutes later I look up and there is the light again in the first original position I had seen it - Only this time it was a white speck of light (looked like a star)!  Again, it stayed in the same spot for a while and then disappeared and again showed up and was at a much higher altitude.<n>

I&#39;ve never seen a star or planet in the daytime so after watching for a few minutes I went inside to grab my camera.   This took a few minutes to find camera, batteries etc.... but when I came back out it was still there.   I took eight pictures with my digital camera.  I watched for a few more minutes and came inside to load and enlarge on my computer.   Needless to say the enlargements are fuzzy, but there is a shape to it.   I went back outside and it was gone.   This happened at 3pm edt, it&#39;s now 6:30 and I&#39;m still searching the sky for this object, to no avail.

It moved steadily, in a straight line, without wavering, through the sky, about 30-40 degrees above the horizon. I moved from the Northwest to the Southeast.  The sky was clear, no air moving at ground level.  The morning sun lighted it nicely, but I could not detect any shape except the square; no hint of a box.  There was no sound.  Believe it was much closer to the ground than the jets which pass over here and I can&#39;t say how large it was;  but a leaf of my maple tree would have hidden it, a leaflet of my rose bush would not.<n>

Initially thought to be a satellite until I realized there were actually three separate objects. Appeared to be at same altitude and speed as most satellites I have observed. At a given point, the objects turned northward and went out of sight by distance factor. What caught my foremost interest was fact that the lights separated when they made the turn northward, then closed again as they moved away, thus my belief they were separate objects. Lights on the objects were white in color and not blinking at all. Same light intensity as a satellite or a distant star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the lights may have been the three satellites that have been reported to us frequently.

I don&#39;t drink or smoke and I don&#39;t do drugs...I am in my early 40&#39;s and have a daughter so we often go to my grandfather&#39;s cottage in the summer.  I&#39;ve been going there with my family since I was 4 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ocurred at our cottage 45 min from Ottawa at Innisville on the Mississippi River.  I sometimes sleep outside in the tent because I like the outdoors and the sound of the water puts me to sleep...this particular night the people next door were playing loud Elvis music and I liked it, so I listened until approx 1:30am.  Just as the music stopped, I lay awake for a few minutes (I had a sharp throbing pain in my arm that wouldn&#39;t go away) and then I heard a low whispy sound outside my tent.(almost like a hot air balloon but the pitch was lower and more consistent)  The reflection of light that shone on my tent was moving very slowly.  Usually when cars go by, the shadows and reflections from headlights move very fast.  I thought it was strange, so I got up and looked out the tent mesh window (I kept it open because the moon was full that night and all the stars were very bright) (saw the Northern lights earlier) When I looked out the window I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing...this was a massive ship (very tall, wide and tubular) completely covered by bright white lights (8 ft away from me) It was a beautiful display of white light  (looked like large light bulbs all over it) it started moving very slowly over the water passing my tent, so of course I ran to the other side of my tent to see where it was going.  It kept going until it was half way to the neighbours cottage (30 ft.)and stopped and just hovered over the water for some time...I just watched (this is something so unbelievable to see and I didn&#39;t know what to do) This was massive and it also had additional tube lighting in which white light circled (travelled) around the ship.  My reaction was to get closer to it, so I unzipped my tent and ran outside towards it.(I don&#39;t know how other people would react but I was so excited and I wanted to make contact) Then, suddenly, with a low sound, it completely disappeared leaving a sharp white light from where I stood and left a trail of light all the way to the stars (it looked like a star in the sky at that point) This trail of white light stayed for a few seconds before the whole thing disappeared) I kept watching this star because I was totally amazed...a few seconds later I saw that star zip across the sky in a sharp straight green line to another  star.  I will never forget that night.  I used to laugh when I saw pictures etc. of flying objects and aliens.  Now, I am convinced that there definately is life beyond our planet.(and a little nervous about the alien part)  I could hardly sleep and was a little nervous to tell everyone in the morning because I thought they&#39;d think I was nuts!  While I was telling my sister in the cottage, my mother said that she was glad someone else saw it. She saw what looked like a ship with windows just outside her window around the same time that morning.  She said she was lying down and couldn&#39;t sleep (the music was keeping her up) and out of nowhere she saw what at fi! rst look ed like shooting stars but then she realized that they were shooting in all directions and there were many of them.  Then she was staring at lights and windows of what she describes as a ship or building.  Anyway, for the next few days we were both in shock.  I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll never forget this either.  I was a little worried about my mom because she&#39;s 78 and was really shaken up about it. She didn&#39;t want to go back to the cottage to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s strange because for the last few nights prior to this incident, my neighbour had been hearing strange sounds like a hot air balloon but never looked out of her window.  She, and her partner also heard a baby crying at 3:00am that woke them and when they looked out the window, she saw nothing.  I always walk in the water as it has very shallow rapids and I noticed this summer that some of the very heavy rock had been moved (it didn&#39;t move when we had a flood several years ago and I wondered how it had moved) This was a particular spot that I used to sit in and I thought it was strange.  Maybe related, maybe not, but it was close to the spot where the ship had been hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))<n>

The four of them then began to pulse from green to orange to red. Then from the distance we saw the others just appear out of no where.  they were about a mile away but they where so bright. they to started pulsing, they did this for about twenty minutes or so and then they just seem to have vanished<n>

We were looking up at the stars that we saw.  There were very few because we were in the heart of the city.  All of the sudden we see this jet roaring towards us coming from the south west and flew overhead.  We ran inside to tell my friends fiance about the jet.  She obiviously heard it.  About 3 minutes later we went outside to finish our cigars.  All of the sudden 3-5 triangular to oval objects flying at high altitude and incredible speed in a chevron or &#34;W&#34; shaped formation.  The objects had no light except for a slight haziness(almost like the lights from the city were reflecting off of them) and made no sound whatsoever.  They flew right behind a tree that was blocking our line of sight and I run away from the tree so that I can catch another glimpse of them.  By the time I got to where my sight was not obstructed, about 4-5 seconds, they were gone.  Of course, we dismissed them as a flock of geese traveling   in a V but the objects were traveling towards the north and they made no honking noises which got us to thinking that these were not geese.  The &#34;objects&#34;  were also traveling at high altitudes and incredible velocity so we ruled them out as geese.  We now believe that the jet was maybe some sort of escort of some sort, maybe sweeping the area with a radar.  We have no explination for the &#34;objects&#34; we saw.<n>

We live on a suburban/rural boarderline, and as me and my Mom are open minded about most things, my girlfriend is a bit skeptical, yet she was the one to point out the lights to me, so... go figure...<n>

As the sound got nearer, there was a musical quality to it. We could also see lights flashing all around the interior of our bedroom. The lights appeared to be red, white, and yellow. The sound moved away after about 15 seconds, then after about 30-45 seconds, the sound and lights seemed to come back around. The music seemde more like the tones of a composition and not like someone&#39;s radio. We were wondering if anyone else saw or heard this and could provide more information.<n>

We sat there in silence watching for maybe 5 or 10 minutes, then the craft just took off as fast as it had came into the night sky. A soon as it had gone we were out of there.<n>

We were still trying to unpack our room so I slept on floor and stared out my window for awhile.  After about 30 minutes a huge white orb came over the window.  The orb itself was incredibly bright but it cast no light around it.  It seamed very low because it so large, it filled my entire view coming over the house and flew past the window.  It gave off the sound of a very deep sounding yell.  The sound was pretty quite but still unmistakable that the orb was making it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was way to large for a plane and it was almost like a perfect circle.  The bottom drooped down.  It flew very slowly over the house, stopping for only a second a little past the window.  It sped up almost suddenly, then slowed back to its original speed, like it  re-thought its movements. The object then flew perfectly strait and level in the direction of north.<n>

Within about a minute I saw a triangular group of what I thought was three stars in the northern sky, these were fairly bright compared to others around them. To my surprise, I noticed that all three stars were moving - together. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and looked away. I looked again and realized they were in fact moving and the three &#34;stars&#34; or lights maintained their exact distance and relationship to each other, as they moved. The shape was a very large thin triangle. As far as its size, holding my arm straight out the object looked like it measured about and inch and a half long and a half-inch wide at its base. It moved slowly through the sky in a southeast direction, with the single light at the front and the two other lights toward the direction it was moving from. All three lights were white and looked just like bright stars - there was nothing visible between them or it may have just been black. The triangle appeared to be very high up in the sky, above normal airplane elevation. I ran into the house and told my wife to come outside, she did. By this time, about 5 minutes after I first saw it, the triangle shape had moved toward the southeast and was nearly straight up in the sky. My wife also saw it and after another 30 seconds or so we lost sight of the triangle, as if it faded or the lights went out. There was no sound and the shape moved fairly slow. Facing north the cities of Milwaukee, then Kenosha, then Pleasant Prairie were under the objects path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting was caused by the three satellites frequently seen flying in formation.

We have observed it for several hours each night over the last three nights.  It remains stationary the entire time that we observe it. I reported it to our local Sheriff&#39;s department, their officers have observed it and concluded that it is a planet whose light is being affected by the aurora.

One red light was in the center of the largest cylinder. There was NO sound at all from this craft. Now comes the wild part, a erie green glow started at the point of the red light then haloed the entire craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then right in all 3 of us and our eyes the damn thing vanished!

While recording this object which was at a 45degree angle or better it appeared to be changing shape or at the least revolving in a strange manner.

Sometimes, it reversed its direction suddenly.  Then I looked at the other two lights, and they seemed to be wobbling, too.  I kept looking at the total shape of the formation and saw that the triangle did change shape, with the light on the right-hand point of the triangle doing the most movement.

The middle light was bouncing between the other two lights, moving like a pendulum. Soon after that the formation changed into a triangle that was continuously changing shape and dimension. Just as they were reaching Kassiopeia they aligned again and performed a very tight and fast 180 degrees turn without any reduction in speed. Right after the turn, the formation started changing again. For a moment the lights gathered close forming a bright single light but almost immediately it broke again in to the three lights, until it dissapeared in the light cloud generated by the nearby city of Volos (east).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Sky was clear with no clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were as bright as a not-so-bright star, but there were fairly easy to spot, mainly because of their highspeed.<n>

I think I saw a weird star formation; something explainable. It was a little after midnight, a very clear and starry night. I was watching the night sky and at northeast there appeared a light, as on an airplane, but the plane seemed like it was to high to be that bright. I then noticed red and bluish lights radiating out from this center bright light (kind of like a Ferris wheel) but not that consistent or organized of a pattern. It appeared to have a key shape. Occasionally there were other clear lights (not yellow or white; clear). At one time, I thought there was a beam but I think my eyes blurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed, it was stationary. It did, however, move very slowly southwest. This went on for approximately 10 minutes. Upon it moving, I noticed there were three linear lights (clear lights) that moved equally with this object-thingy. I figured this had a logical explanation, got a little creepy, and went inside.<n>

The light&#39;s path seemed to gently zig-zag (could be attributed to autokenesis or tired eyes while night driving).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was travelling westbound on M-20, approximately five miles east of MT Pleasant, MI, when this light appeared directly ahead of my position at approximately 11:45 pm.  It was extremely bright and compared to meteors, moved very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could this have been space debris, a bollide or something more anomalous? At approximately 12:30am, forty-five minutes following the sighting, I witnessed a bright flash of light in my upstairs hallway window.  I turned to see a ball of light passing the window and lighting up the hallway.  My five year old cat responded to this by quickly running up to the wall next to the window and staring intently at a point seven feet up and growling.  It took a full ten minutes for him to calm down.<n>
9/4/02 21:24|Lynnwood|WA|Light|2 minutes|Interesting aerial phenomena just after darkfall|9/6/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24857.html|331|ndxe200209| Interesting aerial phenomena just after darkfall<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was outside letting the dogs have their &#34;moment&#34;, before going inside to catch something interesting on the TV.  The sighting took place at almost exactly 2124, according to my cable box before I went outside (I was watching Junkyard Wars; got an addiction to it).  The angle of view that I have from the backyard is small.  I was facing due East, and looking up to see Cassiopea (just to be sure I could still locate it, I was an amateur astronomer in my teens).  I noticed a very bright light, travelling at about the same speed as a satellite.  It travelled from north out of Cassiopea to the south in almost direct North to South direction.  Once it left the constellation of Cassiopea, it headed towards a large fir tree that I was standing almost under.  It slowly began to fade out, to a dot, then to nothing.  The trees that caused the narrowness of my observation are in a line on the property line between our neighbors and our house.  I stepped back and went around under the tree to see if the light would brighten again and reappear (again, too much high end cable; I thought of the solar panels discarded by the astronauts from the space shuttle, that never really re-entered..).  Needless to say, it didn&#39;t.  I returned to my original position, and looked back up to make a sighting of the area that I saw this interesting phenomenon, and saw it happen again!  Exactly in the same manner!  Again I retreated under the tree, and looked to see if it reappeared.  It didn&#39;t.  During the first observation, I noticed a standard jet liner (Paine Field and SeaTac both have planes visible in holding/landing patterns in this area) flying under the object...  Very obviously under the object, with sound and all the attendant lights.  After observing this, I realized that total darkness had happened somewhere around 2050 to 2110 pm.  Whatever it was I saw, I firmly believe was of terrestrial origin.  Both of these objects had an interval of about 1 minute between sightings, and followed the exact same trajectory, and brig! htness t o disappearance ratio during the time of visibility.  I think that whatever it was was either, a) a set of high flying aircraft, that had no paint (i.e. aluminum skin or some other reflective surface), or b) a set LEO (low earth orbit) satellites that caught the suns&#39; rays at just the right place and just the right time, before travelling out of the sun&#39;s light and into shadow.  There were absolutely no trails from the objects, and both were exactly the same in appearance and disappearance.  I wish I knew what they really were!  I&#39;d like to note, after making a selection below this text box, that there were aircraft in the sky, but they were NOT chasing the objects I viewed, they just made the idea that they were LEO much more attractive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the investigators: If an investigator would like to contact me I work odd hours, please leave a message on my voice mail system if you don&#39;t reach me immediately.  I would be glad to call you back and further discuss/investigate this interesting phenomenon.  I also do not check this email address but once every few days (work email is faster, but I wouldn&#39;t commit this through a corporately controlled system, thanks ;), so phone contact is best....<n>

My oldest daughter wanted to go swimming, so we all went out to the pool about 8PM or so.  I was sitting at the side of the pool when my sister started yelling the V is moving!!  I didn&#39;t quite understand what she was saying when she screamed at me to get over there because there was a V moving in the sky.  I looked up and seen the biggest object or collection of objects I have ever seen in my life.It was in the shape of a V but without the bottom line.  It was moving south at a slow pace, not super slow but I think too slow to be a formation of airplanes, besides I have never seen airplanes fly in a V formation.  If it was one object, at least 100 airplanes would have fit in this thing.  I am not sure what I seen but it was totally amazing and kept us in awe for a very long time.  I wanted to report this then but my sister told me I was crazy because nobody would believe us anyway, but I just felt the need to share this and would like to know if anyone else saw this that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Could not see shape of craft, but the lights were very large-- like headlights on a car that is at close distance.  My husband is a private pilot, and although it&#39;s almost impossible to judge height and distance in a nightsky, his &#34;Guestimate&#34; is it was out 3 miles and at 3000ft.  It was over Lake Michigan, so was not anything on the ground. The lights were probably 100 times larger than the stars in the sky.    There was no sound.  It was very exciting to see due to the proximity and size of lights. reported to coastguard<n>

He was looking at constellations through binoculars when I saw it.  At first we were looking at a red flashing light that was moving pretty fast for an airplane. My boyfriend said that through the binoculars you could tell it was an airplane.  Then, right where I had first seen the red light there was a bright light in the sky. At first it looked like a spotlight, then I notice it was shaped like a thick boomerang.  It was glowing yellowish green, and very bright, I could see it very clearly.  I started yelling to my boyfriend,&#34;What is that!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He caught a quick look at it through the binoculars, but didn&#39;t spot it until right before it disappeared. It was at least 50-100 times larger than a star.<n>

We decided to follow it and came to a clearing, when we got to this spot they were both now in the Southeast sky.  We continued to watch them and all the sudden they just started moving towards each other almost like they were going to collide with one another.  They got so close to each other that we could only see one ball of light as they were passing each other.  After they had passed each other, the one moving to the left all the sudden just dissappeared, it was there and then it started moving fast and then gone.  The one moving the other way kept moving and all the sudden just stopped.  It seemed as though it was circling a specific area and while it was doing this it would lift up and then drop and then move left or right.  When we could just see the one it was changing colors from red to white to an almost glowing blue/green and it looked like it was spinning.  We watched it for about 15-20 minutes and it just stayed in the same spot not moving anywhere, just lifing, decending,  moving right/left and changing colors.  We could not believe what we were seeing as we had never seen anything like it before.  It couldn&#39;t have been a plane because planes do not look like they are going to collide and planes don&#39;t stay one spot for this long.  We were in awe.<n>

They appeared as orbital objects that looked like satelites.  The objects did not blink and did not appear to be aircraft.  As they traveled toward the east they faded out about a third of the distance to the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see the objects with naked eyes and they were about 1/2 degree apart.  They crossed just north of andromada at 22:14 cdt. Brightness when I spoted them would have been about -5 to -6.  I think they may have been brighter traveling from the west. It was not one object as I could see stars in the middle of the formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the formation of three U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellites.  PD))<n>

We heard the sound for about 30 seconds and got up from our campsite (out from under some trees) to investigate.  The sound was making area coyotes/dogs howl like crazy.  The object had a red light on one side and a green light on the other, and white lights on the front and back.  The red and green lights were about a third of the way between the white lights-- if you connected the lights, it would look like a kite.  So basically, not terribly unlike a plane, but a different shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However it did not sound like any plane we&#39;d ever heard.  It was traveling relatively slow and low and went directly over us.  As it did, due to the Doppler effect, the sound became lower and the oscillations slower.  We followed it until it disappeared into the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We suspected it might be a B-2, but saw one the flying the next day outside of Alamogordo and it did not sound the same at all.  Based on subsequent Internet research, we&#39;re pretty sure it wasn&#39;t one.  Actually, as an aside, it sort of sounded like the opening music on the MUFON website (www.mufon.com).<n>

While I was standing outside I saw a strange red glowing object moving southwest to northeast. The object appeared to be spherical but was slightly irregular and it&#39;s intensity varied. It looked like it was spinning or burning but maintained it&#39;s trajectory. After watching it for about 5 minutes it suddenly stopped and fell directly to earth. I watched it fall until it disappeared over  the horizon above the surrounding buildings.  As it fell it got even brighter, like a large fireball 500-3000 miles away? I have flown small aircraft and know airplanes. I have also spent many nights camping in Nevada&#39;s desert and know the difference between airplanes, satellites and meteors. When I saw this I was standing in a brightly lit parking lot in the middle of Las Vegas, certainly someone in Northern Nevada must have seen this? I have not seen anything on the news or in the paper? I&#39;m not sure exactly what it was but it was very unusual. Any  information concerning this or news of a related sighting would be greatly appreciated.<n>

It was a very clear night, so we decided to just lean back and look at the stars.  We saw a few planes fly overhead, and then we noticed something strange...  we saw what appeared to be a star moving South across the sky.  It was moving at a very high rate of speed.  We thought at first it was an airplane, but there were absolutely no flashing lights.  We watched it until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  Approximately 3 minutes later, we saw a second craft travelling the exact same flight path.  This time, the craft got extremely bright (no flashing lights - the entire craft went bright), then faded and disappeared.  We then saw two more of these crafts heading North (we have no idea if they were the same two we saw before).  Again, one of these went brilliantly bright.  We then saw one craft heading East.  This was was quite dull.  We saw approximately 10 to 12 more travelling in different directions.  Not all of these crafts travelled in a straight line.  Two that I can remember we sort of &#34;swaying&#34; to the left and right as it passed above us.  As the night wore on, we saw a few more, but they were very dull and seemed to disappear before our eyes.  We have NO idea what these were.  We&#39;ve sat in that hottub many, many clear nights and have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sightings are of satellites.  PD))<n>

This same series of events has occured 3 times at twilight.  I was driving into Burnside Industrial park drving along Burnside Drive when I look up and at a distance I see a black object that has 3 white lights in a triagle formation.  Normally when I see an object in the sky that I do not recigonize I look for the marker lights (e.g. the red flasher on the botom side of most aircraft).  I did not see any on these objects.  One time I did notice a faint steady red light in the centre of one object.  What realy makes these stand out is the fact they are going very slow, and they seem to make the same FLAT left hand turn in about the same area.  Most aircraft except for helicopters will bank to make a turn.  These do not they make a flat aproximetly 45 degree angle left hand turn.  As I stated before I have seen this three times always at twilight and strangly enough appearing to follow the same course.  The next time I spot one of these I will write a report with the exact day and time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was talking on my cellular telephone and glancing at the stars. Two spheres of orange glowing light appeared in the sky from the south east. They appeared to be at a great altitude and were miving extremely fast. one sphere was slightly ahead of the other in a small formation, and then the following orb sped up and passed the first. After about ten seconds they had moved completely out of sight to the northwest. The speed, precision maneuvering, and brightness were unlike anything i have ever witnessed in the sky before.<n>

The light grew closer and smaller lights started to gather in formation around the brighter light. They travelled forward and then would drop so much towards the ground and then level out. This was a continuous manuveur for about 2 hours. As it got closer, I could distinguish the red light on the top of the larger ship and make out seperate individual ships travelling with the red light. I saw approximately 20-25 smaller ships around the red light. The light seemed to change colors as it got closer.They were located in the NE section of the sky and moved to the Western area of the sky. A second grouping was also located in the Eastern section of the sky and I saw a flash of bright light relesed from the first grouping to the second grouping. The first group was in a holding pattern and sent the flash of light to the second group and then the second group formed into a V shape and they held their position as the first group got closer.The first group travelled directly over my house heading West. They were about 20,000 feet over my roof. No wings were apparent and they were silent. Prior to this the flashing lights between the two groups became more sequential and then a bright red light appeared and the communication between the flashing lights ended.All the animals on my street began barking and the horses began kicking out at the fences and whinnying as if a predator was in the area.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Triangle formations over Washington and Oregon checked against satellite data...OUFOR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two team members/investigators for Oregon UFO Research, a husband and wife team, were staying at James Gillilands Sattva Sanctuary over the Labor Day weekend as they frequently do to skywatch near the base of Mt Adams in Trout Lake Washington. Steven Greers group (Disclosure Project) was there on their first night of skywatching during their week long stay in the area for their paid conference. Mr. Greer was not there at the time and was to arrive a few days later. The husband and wife were approximately 150 yards east of the Greer group for their skywatch along the driveway from the main road into the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes after 11:00 p.m. they heard several people in the Greer group to their left shouting in an excited fashion for several seconds. Wondering what the shouting was about they both searched the sky to see what they were looking at. The wife saw it first and it was a triangle. The form was an uneven elongated triangle with one of the trailing lights ahead of its counterpart. The Brightness was dim but was readily discernible as moving together in formation. The husband hastily got out his camcorder and tried to video the object. He could see it in his camera and, after a few seconds, it made a banking turn and headed back the same direction that it came from. Approximately three seconds after it had made the turn, all three lights faded out together. Throughout the whole sighting the three lights stayed in formation and kept the same brilliance. Here is a computer rendition of that sighting by team member Cameron Johnson in the modeling department...<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.oregonuforeview.com/MTADAMS.jpg It was headed from north to south and after the turn it headed back the way it came and rapidly went out. The weather was clear and there are no streetlights in the area. The milky way was readily visible. There was no moon. Everyone who was outside skywatching saw the object or formation...over 15 people. There was no object visible within the lights as they were not markers. There was no sound, or visible trails from it. Its size was about half a hand at arms length. Bill and Ferne were facing north when they saw it and it was directly overhead. There were no obstructions and they report having an excellent view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a substantial sighting and team members ((three names deleted)) will be getting together with the witnesses soon to fill out a detailed report form and gather any further information available.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday, September 6th update...We have recieved NOSS Triad Satellite information for the evening of the sighting and, if in fact these times are correct, indicate that this sighting WAS NOT not satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, at 11:30, a half hour later, another report was submitted from Clackamas, Oregon.  The witness writes... &#34;At 11:30 p.m., I observed three objects traveling from the NW to SE at satellite speed. The objects were as bright as the brightest star. They formed a triangle, one flying directly behind the lead object at some distance (close enough to be considered flying together). The third object was about 45 degrees from the tailing object, closer in the formation, that is between the lead object and its&#39; trailer. The objects were observed both with the naked eye and through 10X50 binoculars. Duration of observation was about 20 seconds, then the objects disappeared after flying directly overhead. This may have been a result of the reflection from the sun being out of reflective range.&#34; The same NOSS triad satellite information for the evening of this sighting shows that this may well be NOSS triad satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Date Mag Time Alt.

It appeared to be at a very high altitude and was extremely large or again, they were seperate objects.  It travelled east to west. There was no sound. After 15 seconds or so, the leading light or tip of the triangle dimmed out and it was no longer visible. When the remaining two got to the same exact point in the sky where the first one disappeared, they did also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the three objects were the U. S. Navy &#34;NOSS&#34; satellites.  Satellites disappear from the sight of viewers on the ground when the former fly into the Earth&#39;s shadow, and therefore they no longer are illuminated by the Sun.  PD))<n>

There was another group there 150 yards to our west, The Greer Group (Disclosure Project).  Just before our sighting many of them were yelling excitedly.  My wife Ferne and I searched the sky to see what the excitement was about.  Ferne saw it first right overhead and it was three lights moving in an elongated triangle formation.  One of the trailing lights was a little ahead of the other.  Was moving slowly from north to south.  After a few seconds it made a banking 180 degree turn returning to the direction it came from and the lights kept in formation.  About 3 seconds after the turn all three lights gradually faded. There was no noise and a clear moonless night. The formation was directly overhead of us. Saw another triangular formation last year about this time but it did not turn as this one did. We did not see an object enclosed within the light formation. I tried to video this event but it did not record. I was trying to video record the lights and as soon as my wife said its a triangle the camera stopped recording and the tape was blank upon review. I did not get any video of it. I had the formation in view all the time as I thought I was recording. In one year of skywatching this is best sighting I have experienced. The lights did not strobe or look like lights on a plane. The lights were white but rather dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for the interesting report!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a few questions about your sighting.  First, what was the apparent size of the formation of three lights, relative to the size of the disc of a full Moon, please?  Also, did the entire formation &#34;bank,&#34; or the individual lights?  What direction did the object turn, please?  Did it end up going to the east, or to the west?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did you look for the object on the following night, by any chance, or on any subsequent night? Also, when the lights faded, did they all fade together, or did they fade at different times?  If the latter, which one faded first, they subsequently?<n> <n><n> <n><n> You state that &#34;one of the trailing lights was a little ahead of the other.&#34;  Do you mean that there were two behind, and one of them was a bit ahead of the other?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much for your report.  We will post it in the near future.  I do not know what it was you saw, but we would like to know more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cordially,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter Davenport<n> <n><n> <n><n> Peter:  The size was about was a little larger than a full moon.  The entire formation made a banking right turn (east) and the lights stayed in the same relative position turning east and continuing to turn untill a 180 degree turn had been made to go back north. So after the turn it was going north.  The next night we decided to go home since I had to work the next day and clouds were building up.   All three lights faded out together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Triangular formation of X&#39;s deleted here.  They will not survive the transfer to the website.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> The formation look somewhat like this, the top being the leading light.   We are going back to Mt adams Friday for two nights of skywatching since we were quite excited to see this.  The Greer group is supposed to be there untill sunday.  We are not part of the group, and the leader of the group has requested privacy from the rest of the guests while they are there.  We have been helping James with maintenance of one of the buildings and helping out in general.  We go there quite frequently when the weather is good to skywatch.  I have seen many moving lights while there over the past year, but this one is the most unusual I have ever seen anywhere and needed to be reported.  As far as I know satellites cannot do this and it definatly was not an airplane.   The one we saw last year looked like this:<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Triangular formation of X&#39;s deleted here.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not turn, was about  the same brightness, and when it faded out the lead light went out first and when the two trailing lights reached the same place they went out together.  The size was slighty larger than the one we have just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any more questions feel free to send an email..

Then all of a sudden we were watching this one satelite and it just dropped at an enormous speed. It came to a complete stop, which it went from just a moving light dot in the sky to a large light that flashed,(which seem to be directly at us.) Then with no noise at all it went straight back up to it&#39;s original height and continued across the sky and then went so high we couldn&#39;t see it any longer. No noise. At first we all thought it was a shooting star, but the light didn&#39;t get bright until it stopped and the light was not like any other light I had seen. It was something I had never seen before and being an outdoor kinda person I was completely bewildered as to what it actually was. How anything man-made could move as such a tremdous speed. No craft was seen, just the light.....It seemed like the light had a cover and they opened to expose the flash of light.<n>

The light lit me up, im not really sure how long the event actually was but it felt like ages but less than a minute seemed to of gone by. It made me feel good inside.

I saw this strange light.  It didn&#39;t look like an ordinary plane or other flying object.  It was triangular in shape.  When I first saw it, it was just a bright white/clear looking light.  I grabbed my cheap pair of binoculars and began to gaze at the object.  After about a second of looking at it through the binoculars the color changed and suddenly appeared neon green and a redish pinkish color.  It looked really amazing.  Suddenly the street light by my house went out, the lights of the apartment next door turned on, my friends house across the street&#39;s lights started going on and off, and the wind picked up and began to blow the trees rapidly about.  The nieghborhood grew quite odd for a few minutes with many wierd things occuring.  The object changed speeds all of a sudden and moved very quickly for about an inch and a half distance (that is it seemed from down here on Earth meaning it must have been miles).  As the object traveled through the sky, it seemed to rotate as it moved, kinda like how the planets rotate in the sky as they orbit the sun.  It was rotating one way and moving another.  There are very tall trees next door. The flying object was blocked from my veiw by the trees.  I could see it through the branches a bit.  I went to my other window hoping it would countinue going straight and appear to me once more, but no such luck.  I believe the object flew over to the other side of my house and was then out of veiw.<n>

An object was hovering above the Pacific Ocean, beyond the bay of Las Banderas. It remained approxiately on a 90 degree angle with it&#39;s nose pointing towards the Ocean. There was no momentum, lights, sounds or odd movement. The object gradually ascended into the clouds where it appeared to fade but was still noticiable. The front portion of the object is shaped like an arrowhead with a shaft connecting the rear portion. The rear is huge given the distance from the point of video taping.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was losing control, then regained and took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think it was late summer or start of fall, in 2002. We were visiting family at my husbands sisters house, then me and him left in my car to go get food for everyone, it was about 8:30 PM.  We were in a pretty suburban area. Houses on blocks, apartments, a YMCA right near by. We were driving along a straight stretch and my husband said &#34;oh my goodness that plane is gonna crash&#34;. I thought he was joking told him playfully to shut up and then he said &#34;no seriously.&#34; I looked in my rear view mirror and saw a large black object coming overtop of a hill behind us. It was sort of wobbling side to side like it was about to lose control, and it was dangerously low and close to the power lines, then it seemed to sort of start getting control again. I stopped my car right in the middle of the street, there was no other traffic around. I turned around and started looking out the back window. It was going very slow and then about not even 200 feet behind my car it stopped and started to just hover. I was like a straight up triangular shape looked almost as if you drew a big letter A, standing straight up in the sky. It was black very sleek and on one side it was completely covered with lights, green, red and yellow. They were all blinking and there had to be 200 hundred of them. We just set there in awe. Then all of a sudden it took off. It left so fast you could almost see lines in the air after it (another strange thing I noticed when it took off it made no sound at all, any other aircraft you would have heard take off noise, it just zipped off with nothing). I just went on impulse through my car into drive and tried to follow. I was going about 90 mph trying to follow it. I saw a ramp unto the highway and by the time I got up on the highway we could only barely see the lights of the UFO way off in the distance. When we got back to his sisters house I couldn&#39;t help but try to tell them what we had seen. NO one believed us. So, we haven&#39;t really talked about it since. Has anyone else seen a UFO like that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Knowing this distance from my position I could determaine the size and alltitude of the object. I estimate this sphere being approxamittly ten feet in diam. and two hundred feet in alt. This object flew on a flat trajectory and speed about two to three hundred miles per hour with the speed being determined by the distance traveled in the time span of the sighting.  A hissing sound was heard as it flew past. What made this object look so strange was the surface of it appeared to be made of mercury because as it passed by I could see wind resistance created by the speed of travel made it appear to wave.  Like if one was to blow air on liquid causing a rippling affect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The objects had many different shapes.  They would change into another shape as they flew around the nights sky.  A couple of the objects even dropped something from the sky which fell to the ground nearby.  This whole sighting was caught on tape for the entire duration to prove it.  Each object had many lights surrounding it always changing colors and flashing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether advertising lights might have been the cause of the sighting.  PD))<n>
9/1/02 06:30|Edinboro|PA|Unknown|10 minutes|strange contrail in the northwestern pa. sky over lake erie.|9/19/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25065.html|374|ndxe200209| strange contrail in the northwestern pa. sky over lake erie.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i was driving east to hit the interstate 79 southbond when i saw a huge contrail in the north east sky over lake erie.it was going east at a high altitude and at arms length it was about 2 inches long and 3/8 of an inch wide.i could not see what was making this as it was going at an angle away from me.the strange thing was that the contrail had a wavy or swirling appearance to it and to see that at it being so high in the sky was a bit odd.as it moved the contrail stayed at the same length and left no trailing residue.as i pulled onto the interstate and headed south it disappeared over a range of clouds in the eastern sky.i never saw a contrail that looked like that and was wondering what would make such an odd looking one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our suspicion is that the witness may have observed a rapidly dissipating contrail, which maintained its apparent length, when viewed from ground level.  That is only a guess.  PD))<n>
9/1/02 04:00|Sacramento|CA|Light|3 minutes|Sept. 1, 2002  4 am  at Sacramento, CA ....At 4am my dog started barking so I got up to see what was going on. On my way back in I glan|9/6/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24798.html|375|ndxe200209| Sept. 1, 2002  4 am  at Sacramento, CA ....At 4am my dog started barking so I got up to see what was going on. On my way back in I glanced up to the sky as it was very clear that night. There it was; a &#34;cruising star&#34;. Very bright like Jupiter but it did change intensity as its&#39; altitude seemed to change. It was not a satelite, I&#39;ve seen many. This UFO went slow then jumped, seemed to climb in a circular fashion, stopped, zipped fast, stopped, cruised even slower, then went into a straight climb, blinked 3 times and then blinked out. It changed position and rate of speed at least 10 times in the three minutes I watched it. I followed it across about a third of the sky, say 60 degrees(which is alot). After it blinked out I kept looking for about 5 minutes, no luck. It was very exciting and I wonder if I can go back to bed.( It&#39;s 5 am now ) This was a &#34;way cool&#34; sighting....

9/1/02 00:15|Parry Sound (Canada)|ON|Triangle|30 seconds|Triangular shaped object / lights over Parry Sound, Ontario. Sunday Sept 1, 2002|9/6/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24834.html|376|ndxe200209| Triangular shaped object / lights over Parry Sound, Ontario. Sunday Sept 1, 2002<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was observed while we were boating in Georgian Bay. Actual latitude and longitude can be retrieved from data stored in my GPS. We were anchored overnight near Part Rawlston ( Parry Sound ). The sky was clear and given our remote northern location ther was no interference from rural lighting. The object compared to commercial aircraft observed earlier, appeared to be at a higher altitude and was extremely large.  It consisted of three lights in a triangular shape. Not a perfect triangle but with one side shorter that the other. It travelled east to west with no sound. As it went further east the lights suddenly dimmed out and it was no longer visable. Three adults witnessed the object.<n>
