8/31/10 23:00|House Springs|MO|Disk|2 minutes >|August 31, 2010, strange saucer shaped craft with large dome on top and many lights hovered over our yard in House Springs, Missouri|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77575.html|1|ndxe201008| August 31, 2010, strange saucer shaped craft with large dome on top and many lights hovered over our yard in House Springs, Missouri<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 31, 2010, 11:00 pm central time, my family and I spotted a UFO in the sky near our home in House Springs, Missouri.  It was just a normal evening and our dog started acting strange and my children were outside. I yelled out to my children to come take the dog out thinking that maybe he had to go out, but he was acting out of control, jumping on a table near the window like he wanted to jump right through the window.  After a few moments I became frustrated and put the dog on his leash to do it myself since my children were not listening to me. I stepped out the door with the dog, frustrated that my children were not even responding to me and enquiring as to why they ignored me. I saw my children all standing in the yard staring up into the sky as if they were mesmerized by something. I started looking up to see what had their attention and there was a craft of some kind, hovering over the trees.  The craft we saw was like a saucer shaped craft with a ! large dome on top of it, There were many lights shining from the lower portion of the craft ranging in color from the brightest white I have ever seen, to a peach color.  The craft was a dark grey metallic color and underneath of the craft had 16 dark spots that appeared to be like holes or tube shaped portals that led into the craft. We all stood there mesmerized for what felt like forever, including the dog, unable to move or speak, though in reality the whole thing took no more than two minutes.  As we stood there looking at this craft, it suddenly shot straight into the sky so fast we could not stay focused on it.  Within seconds of the craft leaving there were 3 fighter jets in formation flying by, one of which appeared to try following the craft into the sky, while the other two appeared to stay near the tree line.<n>

The shape of the object seem more like a comet&#39;s tail except it did not flare out like a comet, but more like long lengthy wavering shimmer of white.  Not like a comet where the pattern trail is consistent. This object had waves as it traveled from south to north east.  The closest shape would be a smooth long rectangular see through cloud that was traveling fast and keeping its shape too, Not a lenticular cloud.  As private pilot and air crew in the air force, I have neve! r seen this type of cloud move so fast with a white shimmer contrasting with the black background, the night sky. In fact I have never seen this at all.  It reminds me of a spirit like in the movies, but much longer than a C-5 Air craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had time to take good look, around for clouds, other air craft&#39;s that are usually noisy, but this one did not have a noise or any sound.  It did not leave a trail, but it did move relatively fast, faster than plane coming into Mather&#39;s flying pattern.  In fact I was able to run to the second floor and look out the east window of the house and continued to observe it.  I mention it to my wife who was also upstairs and we both quickly looked out the east window and saw it together.  Although my wife is near sighted, she still was able to see a faint cloud like shape moving horizontal.  The object disappeared with our neighborhood lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can tell you what it&#39;s not: •	an airplane or a jet at near idle speed coming for a landing •	No navigational or landing lights •	Not a helicopter •	Not the Space Station in which we sometimes see it fly by •	Smoke cloud. Smoke clouds do not move in that form •	Not a lenticular cloud (see plenty of those at high altitude) I went back out and really looked at the sky and I thought I saw another faint object and it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is it and here I&#39;m writting this!<n>

It was traveling  northeast towards Long Island.I saw it while I was driving near the Belt Parkway close to JFK airport.

The sky condition was fairly clear, with  a high level haze (no clouds), the sun was near setting. A star was visible at the time. No other aircraft visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object first appeared to be a cigar shape aircraft, no wings, no noise, no vapour trail, it was metallic, glowing, shinning very brightly and was moving slowly in a south west direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then flashed brightly, twice and slowly separated evenly, into two spherical objects, and then joined together into one round bright object, like a ball of bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball of light grew in intensity, then quickly faded away and vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The total time of observation was about 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have worked in the aviation industry for thirty years, beside an airport and have seen countless aircraft take-off and depart. This object did not resemble anything I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen many aircraft flying at high altitudes, twenty to thirty thousand feet in the same area. This object was clearly visible and I estimate the altitude to be around nine thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like a plane at first, it had one pale blue light and one red light- one of 2 of its chambers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not moving at, more hovering before moving every so slowly south.  It was silver, not shiny, and it had 3 circular compartments connected by metal bars, in the shape of a triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There wasnt any sound that i could tell. I mention this becaseu it was out in the courty and often times we can hear planes even when we cant see them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a second before it began moving, I thought I saw a very light greenish glow casting downwads, but it could have been my mind playing tricks on me.<n>

8/30/10 23:00|Veneta|OR|Unknown|3-4 mins|Orange flickering orb of light flying low and slow in Oregon|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77559.html|10|ndxe201008| Orange flickering orb of light flying low and slow in Oregon<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking back from a nearby convenience store at right around 11:00pm on August 30, 2010.  The moon was about three quarters full but close to the eastern horizon so the stars were very clear.  Veneta is very small town so there is not much in the way of lights to block out the sky so I was checking it out as I walked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the south I saw an orange slightly flickering light moving north toward my position very slowly.  The object was moving parallel to Territorial Highway and just barely east of it.  The color seemed strange but I assumed whatever it was would become more easily identifiable, once it got closer, in the form of clearly blinking lights or lights other than the flickering orange.  This however was not the case.  Its appearance did not change in any way.  I could not make out any definite shape or see anything other than just an orange slightly flickering light.  Judging by my perception of its altitude it was not a very large object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remained in place in the parking lot of the Veneta public library watching as it moved at a speed of about 15 mph or less at an altitude of approximately 150 to 200 feet.  I could hear no sound coming from its direction.  When it had reached my position it slowed to a stop.  It was now just east of me as I stood in the library parking lot along Territorial Hway.  The object or orb remained stationary for about 45 seconds then began to move east and directly away from my position.  At first I wasn&#39;t sure if it was actually moving or just getting smaller.  I kept watching as it became clear that it was moving east and slowly gaining altitude. After about a minute I could no longer see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s direction of movement would have taken it over Eugene, OR, which is much bigger so there is the possibility that it was seen there.<n>

He knocked on the window to get the attention of my 14 year old son who looked out the window and then ran out.  Once it was over the street I ran inside for my camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realized my SD card was not inside of it as we just returned from Mexico. By the time i got back outside, the fire ball was gone. My husband had come in and grabbed his camera off of the counter and was able to get a few seconds of this, but it was not clear and the ball of fire looked too small and white in the video. I asked where it went and my son said it went in a straight line, never stopping, and then it curved to the left and sped up and then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went inside and about 15 minutes later I heard a helicopter. We went outside and saw it flying slowly over our house and then in the direction that the light had come from. It proceeded to then fly over a few more times. It never went in the direction that the object flew towards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live less than 10 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, this is the direction in which the fire ball flew. We do not get alot of helicopter activity over our home. The skies were very clear and we had a great view of the stars and I had just pointed that out. There was no breeze tonight. It is hot and muggy and it was very dark. None of our neighbors were outside. There was no sound whatsoever as this thing flew over us. No smell at all. It did not hover or stop or go in any other direction while it was over us. It went in a straight line and at the same altitude until it got pretty far then curved, sped up and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I read about Chinese lanterns, but as far as I know there are no Chinese holidays today, and these tend to be in groups and hover. Our fire ball was alone and was at a steady speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Bright light above the houses across the street from my own.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moved at varying speeds and multiple directions.  It also slowed to a stop and hovered.  Absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From a distance the light looked white.  As it got closer it appeared to be blue/green.  Could see normal air traffic flying above and behind it.  This really gave a good sense of the speed and maneuverability of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the second time I have seen this object.  This time I caught it on video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))<n>

I noticed three distinct clouds that caught my intrest. Two were parallel to each other looking like they had been emitted by jet exhaust. They were approximately two miles long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also another cloud just to the east/ south east that was fatter and shorter and was directly over me at one point. All three clouds were dispersing their content as they were being gently moving with the wind to the  east / south east. The short fat cloud looked rather strange at the time slowly turning into a circular shape with a waterfall of mist being left behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was looking at this I notice a stationary speck in the sky just under this cloud. I quickly (10 to 15 seconds) retrieved my binoculars and focused on this object.  It moved up into this cloud for 20 seconds then moved back down.  When it had cleared the cloud I could see it was a shiny metallic object,! upside down cone shape with a domed top.  It was hovering near the cloud for approximately 20 seconds and then started moving down in a slow fluid motion occasionally skipping North East on its seeming descent.  It only took 20 seconds of observation before I lost sight of it behind some large trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved to a clearing but could not regain sight of the object.  I do not think this was a metallic Mylar balloon. If it was it would have blown with the winds aloft to the east/ south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object appeared to be much larger than a Mylar balloon also.<n>

Almost 3 minute duration. Very high up in the sky until it flared out. Second was about 2 minutes later, same direction, but much lower. When the flare of orange went out, it appeared to be an oval shaped craft much lower in the sky. No wings and no apparent aerodynamics. It took about 4 minutes to traverse the sky from South to North/northeast. The 3rd was another fireball moving much faster and higher in the sky then the first one. Meanwhile, sirens from the local police and fire department were going off continuously. They were also moving north. NO FLASHING LIGHTS were visible on the objects at anytime and they were in Bishop International Airport airspace. We have planes go over us continuously and these were not planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I took 15-20 pics every couple of minutes as the sun broke through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning I downloaded the pics off the camera and saw this black, oval object toward the right of the clouds that I did not see while taking the pictures.  It only appeared in this one picture so I am CERTAIN it is not a dust speck on the lens.  I can see heat waves around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I am pretty sure it’s not a helicopter.  They fly over all the time and I hear them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a silent morning, except for the freeway sounds below.<n>

About 5:15 A.M this morning.   I went outside to my courtyard to drink my coffee and admired the sky like I usually do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been starring at the sky for couple of minutes, when I saw what appears to me as clouds approaching but I realized that it was more like  a flock of birds flying high in the sky,(high up like a cloud) about 5 of them crossing the sky from west to east forming a like triangle.  Each bird shape appears to be like three times the size of the moon when you see it from the ground; the stars appear very small next to each of them in size like dots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I found to be strange was the color and the way they moved forward.  Their color was like the fire from a lighter; translucent with a pink-orange tone the only thing I can compare them to is to clouds in the horizon when the morning is breaking through.  However keep in mind that is was still dark outside, only the moon and the stars shining.  The way they moved was like it was gliding in the sky, like swimming in the ocean.  They were out of sight in about 10 seconds. It was an incredible!<n>

It was late at night about a week ago and I was looking up towards the moon. Directly to the left of the moon was an unusual light.  It somewhat resembled a star at first, but then it became clear that it was giving off both blue and red light, and also had a shaft of light on the front of it, which distorted its twinkling, and made it look more unusual.  I watched the object for several minutes, wondering what it was. It stayed stationary the whole time, and eventually I went to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was very bright and memorable. I witnessed a similar object the next night, elsewhere in the sky. Once again I observed it for several minutes and it stayed stationary.  These objects are no longer in the sky.  The moon offered a great reference point for the first one I saw, since it was so close to the left of the moon, and it is obvious that whatever it was is now gone.  That’s all there was to it!<n>

8/29/10 21:50|Waterloo (Canada)|ON|Circle|30 sec.|Two mysterious objects flying near Waterloo|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77535.html|27|ndxe201008| Two mysterious objects flying near Waterloo<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 29th, 2010, yesterday night, I was returning home with my family from Grand Bend, Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were driving E.(East) on Highway 7 near Waterloo at the time. According to Google Maps the exact towns name is Wilmot, Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The highway did not have any lights on the side of the road, making it very easy to see the stars in the sky.  At 21:50 (9:50pm) I was looking out the window from the back seat of the car (right side) and was looking at the stars, which I enjoy watching occasionally at home. When I was looking up, I noticed two objects straight up very far off in the distance moving across the sky very quickly from right to left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were moving very fast side by side from the right side to the left side. At first, the objects were traveling beside each other, but after a couple of seconds the object farthest away from me quickly turned and started separating from the other object. After a few more seconds, the objects once again started traveling parallel to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told my younger brother who was also with me that I see something strange in the sky, he looked up and also saw the two objects. He also said they did not look like planes or satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried taking a picture, but the objects were too dim to be displayed on the camera. We pulled the car to the side of the road to take a better picture, but when we did, we lost track of the objects, they split up again and vanished. I still however took a picture of the stars I saw that night. (10sec. exposure, f/1.4 ISO 200) – yes, I am a photographer and I have taken pictures of stars before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in an area where planes fly over head of my house all the time. My house is located where the planes turn around and head for their final approach for landing. I know how planes look like in the sky up high or lower, and this was no a plane. First, planes have blinking lights, this did not. Planes travel relatively slowly when you see them really high in the air, but these two objects were moving super fast! I have never seen anything move that fast, that far away. I also want to state that I know how satellites look like. I do see some occasionally in the night as I do look at the stars frequently. They do go fairly slow and are a bit dim. But, this was much faster and both objects were much brighter and were constantly lit, not going from dim to bright and so forth. These objects were for sure not planes or satellites.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *I know when this happened and where this happened exactly because I had a GPS at the time and I recorded an audio clip of myself explaining what I saw; location, time, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

To the north I saw a fuzzy blob that was coming my way very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It quickly became several points of light that flew over slightly east of my position and kept going south until they vanished into the sky glow over Salt Lake City to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There must have been about two dozen of them flying in formation.  They looked like stars of medium intensity, that is, they were the about the same size and color.  It wasn&#39;t a fixed pattern but they moved in relation to each other.  There was no sound that I could hear and the lights did not flash or leave a trail.  They covered about 2/3 of the visible sky in about 10 seconds.  There was no telling how high or how fast they were actually going but I’m guessing they were about the height of the nearby mountain tops.<n>

At about 9:15 PM I looked to the north and I saw what appeared to be an airplane in the night sky to the north.  The object had a red light on it and a white light on it.  I continued walking, but when I looked back a minute later I noticed that the object had not moved at all.  Thinking that this was weird I stopped and watched the object for a couple minutes.  The object continued to stay in the same spot in the sky for the entire time that I watched it. I continued walking toward my house while watching the object, and as I neared my house I ran inside to tell my family to come look at the UFO. They immediately ran out to see it, but by the time we looked again it had vanished.  After talking to them about the object my brother informed me that a friend of his had seen it the night previous in a similar area of sky.<n>

Even with the use of a decent set of binoculars, I have been unable to determine exactly what it is.  I have been seeing the exact same object almost every night for the last two weeks. It moves very slowly to the north until it can no longer be seen.  I would estimate that the object is flying somewhere over riverhead or calverton, then north to the long island sound out of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m definitely not implying that this is an alien spacecraft, but I would like to know exactly what it is.

Facing north, I noticed a fireball moving in the northeast night sky. I asked my friend, &#34;What is that?!&#34;, pointing it out. She locked on to it easily. The apparent flaming orb stopped moving and hovered. The &#34;flame&#34; went out and the object appeared as having red stationary lights, with white blinking lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light turned green and we darted straight across the highway (east). The lights seemed so close, perhaps within a couple hundred yards high.  Coming to a clearing in the trees on my left I saw it just hanging there!  I threw on the emergency brake and we both got out of the car.  I fumbled with my new phone wanting to take pics or video.  I was too rattled and unfamiliar with it to be successful. There was NO sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could make out the shape and surface texture of a metallic disk, the lights under the belly.  It was not smooth, but pitted like welding slag.  Our jaws were hanging for 20 seconds or so, then the disk turned on its axis and stood like a wheel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m constantly asking, &#34;Do you see this??!&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved SSW and when we turned to follow it, when I noticed cars were backing up behind us, and one driver was out of his car too.  He was looking at us asking &#34;what are you doing?&#34;.  I pointed over his head yelling &#34;A UFO!&#34;.  I didn&#39;t wait for him to react.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got back in the car and U-Turned to follow this thing, but never found it.

Thinking this was just an aircraft moving in my line of sight (stationary), I opened the blinds to get a better look, only to discover three more bright orange lights below this object, moving towards it.  No sounds of aircraft was present.  The lights joined up, formed a semi-circle, then the end light faded away leaving the remaining three lights to form a triangle (picture available), only to fade away as if moving into a fog.  From the East, more orange lights continued to appear sometimes two or three at a time moving through the tree line, joining up with the other objects, pausing, then fading away.  At any given moment, there was a dozen lights in the sky.  It was as if this was a &#34;gathering&#34;.  This gathering lasted 20 minutes.<n>

Coming up on it I thought it was a helicopter (possibly looking for the couple of people that have been reported missing over the past couple weeks).   As I drove a little closer i realized that it was not a helicopter.  it was pefectly still and made no noise (windows down and no radio).  Driving under it i noticed the triangle pattern of lights.  i drove past it and turned around, in that time it was gone.   Thinking that maybe becasue where i turned around was at the bottom of a hill so maybe that was why i couldnt see it, i back tracked.  also to make sure maybe it wasnt just a pole with lights or something but it was indeed completely gone.<n>

When I saw it, it was headed east on Rt. 44, just past the intersection of Rt. 3 (a highway). While Rt. 44 is not a highway, it is a very busy street with grocery stores, gas stations and such, and it was flying much lower and slower than an airplane would fly. It made no sound. It had 3 unblinking orbs of light, and was clearly triangle shaped. It wasn&#39;t much higher than the treetops. I had just pulled into a grocery store parking lot, saw it, stopped the car, rolled down the windows, and my son and I just stared at it and watched it head east down 44.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Thank you for Understanding. The Only Thing they will comment on is: “We both saw something and don’t believe it was anything important.”  Report in Detail  I was in the pool floating on a raft. My sister is also on a raft. My father is on the deck reading a book. Their is not a cloud in the sky except for some puffy ones to the west. Sometime between 3:32 PM and 4:00 PM Eastern time I’m laying on the raft facing the SouthEastern Sky. Out of thin air this brown object appears. I’m not frightened but puzzled. The object approaching from the SouthEast after clearing the tree line by my family’s pool dose a very smooth and graceful pitch &amp; yaw towards the east; and louses some altitude. As it cruses eastward for a bit it all of a sudden dose the unthinkable! It abruptly moves in a straight horizontal line in a flash northward, and I am now dead on, squared, straight forward, looking at the back end of this sucker. It is massive, and is now Four houses ahead in the sky over the backyards of where I am in the pool. As I look over the fence that is parallel with the hight of the pool the object is heading Eastward. It seams to ! be powered by 6 white lights in groups of 2, in 3 neatly stacked rows inside a vertical rectangle. The object makes no noise the entire time over the course of the viewing. While the craft is heading eastward it now decides to yaw left towards the NorthEast in a diagonal line pattern. As the craft travels NorthEast the back end lights are now separating off the back end of the craft and are rapidly creating a pulsing light dance around the craft, like electrons dancing around an atom. The balls of white lights are now pulsating rapidly to the point where they are looking like they are giving off static electric shocks and light bolts. While doing this the craft so elegantly yet very swiftly fades away into oblivion. The duration of time felt like an eternity to me, but sadly I later estimated the event to ruffly 40 seconds; a minute was way to long. This is my testimony to what I had encountered. It is up to you my Friends to make of it what you want. As for the other witne! sses to the event, they ether saw bits and pieces due to obstr! uction o f view from the trees, or they hardly caught the last few seconds of the event. I hope you the enthusiasts have enjoyed reading my first and hopefully the last encounter that I will ever endure.<n>

They were absolutely silent and moved slightly sporadically.  The disks were spinning, but not on a perfect axis.  They were not in sync, but they stayed relatively close to one another for the approximate two minutes in which I observed them. It seemed as though they were moving closer and they flew higher extremely fast.   From my perspective, it seemed as if they flew straight up into the sky. I was able to keep an eye on the objects the whole time until I had to travel below an overpass and I lost sight of the objects, which were very far away the last time I had my eye on them. I was a passenger in a car with two other people, who both observed the objects.  Traffic notably slowed down on the exit ramp, as I assume that other drivers noticed them as well. When the car I was in parked at the mall, I got out and saw an unmarked plane, and I am! not sure if it had any relation to the UFO sighting I had witnessed minutes before.   The sighting did not have any physical effects on me or on any of the other passengers in the car that I was traveling in.  As one who takes particular interest in UFOs I was absolutely speechless to observe the sighting, and it has left a traumatizing mental effect, as the images I saw have been in my head the whole day. I am very curious as to whether or not anybody else reported the sighting.<n>

Within seconds it started heading &#34;down&#34; starting with a basic flashing pattern of 2 and 1, but then it changed along with its trajectory.  The light was extremely bright most of the time, and then it would dim-- the timing was very erratic, and it just darted about. It stayed in the vicinity of the moon and Jupiter for about 20 minutes and I finally went inside. With binoculars, you got the sense that whatever it was, it was trying to get attention, as anyone scanning the sky with equipment at that time could not have missed it. It could not, however be seen by the naked eye.  Before I went inside, I saw a perfect rectangle cloud directly overhead.<n>

I was on my way back from getting food on my break around 2:10 am, and saw a floating object directly over the intersection in front of the hospital. It was just over the traffic lights. I stopped (at a green light) to see what it was but cannot wrap my head around what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was grayish blue, there were no streetlights just car headlights, it is very dark around the hospital, and I estimate it as being the size of a large dog. To me it looked like some sort of creature, floating silently and slowly straight up. No drifting or blowing in the wind. It had what looked like a very large head with the rest of the body which did appear to have 4 appendiges about the same size as the head, and it appeared to be almost upside down. it didnt move, just floated up as if being lifted from the sky. I turned around and went back, and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I parked in the back of the hospital parking lot and a man with a little boy were walking out to the road pointing and looking where the object had been. I walked up to him and asked if they saw it too and if they knew what it was. He said that he did, he was able to see it from up close to the hospital. But he didn’t know what it was either. It was gone. I don’t know hoe it could have disappeared so fast or whether anyone else in the cars saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking out the windows that night I noticed the moon was large, and there was a very large very bright light that stayed in the same proximity to the moon the entire night.

The next 2 nights I’ve seen nothing and the moon is gone. I am baffled and terrified.<n>

8/29/10 00:15|Baltimore|MD|Light|20 min|Orange orb floating over Baltimore|8/30/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77510.html|44|ndxe201008| Orange orb floating over Baltimore<n> <n><n> <n><n> An unexplained orange light was observed by over 15 to 20 patrons on the roof terrace of a nightclub in Baltimore, MD, at approximately 12:15 AM on Sunday, August 29, 2010.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first noticed an unusual glowing orange shape in the sky, perhaps a few thousand feet above the roof of the club, about 80 degrees above the horizon.  I then looked around to see if others had seen the object, and noticed that several other patrons were already staring skyward.  We began to ask each other if we were seeing the same thing, and if we had any idea what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial reaction was that I was seeing some sort of balloon suspended in the sky with a light shining on it.  However, I quickly realized that the light was being emitted from the object itself.  I felt very strange as I stared upwards in disbelief along with several others.  The orange orb appeared to be changing its shape.  Its movements during this time are hard to describe, but seemed to be pulsing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The nightclub featured many patrons with glow sticks and other flashing lights.  A DJ was playing electronic music from the roof terrace.  I began pointing at the object with two glow sticks to help others see what I was talking about.  At this time, it began to pull back further up into the sky.  The light became dimmer and it moved near what appeared to be a star in the sky, slightly to the west at about 60 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over approximately the next twenty to thirty minutes, the orange glowing orb would generally move in a methodical fashion between several stars / planets in the night sky.  Sometimes it would move slowly and deliberately, while other times it would move in quick movements.  On one occasion, while pointing the light out to another individual, we watched as it slowly approached a star, and then made a semi-circle movement around the star, and then proceed in a straight line.  Based on my own amateur use of a night sky computer program, I believe that this star may have been Altair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried to take a picture of the object with my phone&#39;s camera. The object did not appear on the camera, however, an unexplained square orange shape appeared on one image, which I would be happy to provide if needed.  I did not see any square shapes with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At least 15 to 20 patrons witnessed the same event over the course of approximately 20 to 30 minutes.  After I went to find others and return, patrons could no longer locate the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The coordinates of the sighting location are 39.293&#39; North, 76.611&#39; West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently a ((deleted--graduate)) student at a university in the Washington, DC, area.<n>

To be precise it was more of a flame with red, orange and yellow just like a flame, flickering but not going out. We at first thought it might be a helicopter but it made no sound and moved at the speed of a helicopter, but not like any that we have ever seen. We have never seen any odd things in the night sky so tonight has been disturbing. It moved out of sight behind trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/28/10 22:30|Rochester|NY|Fireball|10 minutes|We saw 20 to 30 fireballs floating or gliding higher and then slowly flickering out.|8/30/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77516.html|46|ndxe201008| We saw 20 to 30 fireballs floating or gliding higher and then slowly flickering out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and my sister and I just came back from playing miniature golf and were driving along the road. My sister saw what she thought were red stars and asked what they were.  My husband and I both said they were just towers, as we were near the airport.  But then they started to move and get closer and we knew they were not towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every few seconds more would float up until there were about 20 to 30 in the sky. We pulled over into a nearby plaza to get a better look and try to get some pictures.  Several other people had pulled in to look at them too.  One guy yelled out his window to us &#34;what ARE those?&#34;   We answered that we had no idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were completely silent. They left no trails.  They looked like orangish-reddish fire, they flickered, but it was clear that it was not aircraft lights (like red/white of planes).  Also they didn&#39;t appear to flash uniformily like a light bulb would.  It looked more like the flickering of fire. After a while the lights started to flicker out.  But my husband then pointed to where one of them was and we saw that we could still see something moving against the sky, it was just completely darkened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point there was a commercial jet in the sky and they were moving about twice the speed of the jet. But before, while they were lit up, they were moving much slower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us are college educated, upper middle class.  My sister is 25. I am 29, and my husband is 34.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We assume an evening sighting, and have amended the time above, to reflect that fact.  PD))<n>

The object appear to be round and a distance from us.  We saw red lights at times and green lights at other times, however it did not function like a jetliner.  It darted strangely back and forth in the sky, almost like a zig-zag at times, other times it appeared to be circling slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three of us sat and watched for an hour and a half as it drifted around, eventually we lost site of it behind the tree.  It&#39;s flight path was eerie, at times a red halo appeared around the object.  It would move quickly to the right, stop, and then drift in another direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it may be a weather balloon but after researching them online today don&#39;t feel that it was.  I know there are 2 military bases in proximity to the area we were camping in and questioned whether it may be some time of government craft.  Whatever it was, it was strange and unlike anything I! &#39;ve ever seen in the night sky.<n>
8/28/10 22:20|Mannford|OK|Unknown|5 Minutes|Reddish-orange orbs hovering, them disappearing in the night sky|8/30/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77483.html|49|ndxe201008| Reddish-orange orbs hovering, them disappearing in the night sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Starting at approximately 10:20 pm I observed 3 reddish-orange &#34;blobs&#34; or &#34;orbs&#34; that appeared to be hovering or moving slowly at about an angle of 15° - 20° in the sky, directly south of Mannford Oklahoma. After watching them for about 1 minute and unable to determine what they might be, I went inside and got my son and daughter-in-law to see if they could determine what the objects were. Shortly after they came outside, we also noticed a fourth object of the same type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From our vantage point looking directly south of our location, the three of us watched them move across the sky in a west to northwest path without any hint of sound or noise to be heard at all, and they appeared to be gaining in elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son attempted to capture a video (that didn&#39;t work), so at 10:22 pm he finally successfully took a photo of one of the objects using his cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Each one of the objects, in turn, disappeared in the approximate same position or location in the sky, roughly at an angle of around 35°-40° parallel from ground level and roughly 35° to 45° farther west of the position that I first noticed them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In total, we watched them for about 5 minutes before they disappeared in the night sky.<n>

We reside in a high rise building and lost sight of the object after about 2 minutes as it travelled over our building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to go onto the patio of our residence and could not hear any sound coming from the object.  It was moving at a pace consistent with air traffic , but was outside of the normal areas where we have previously seen air traffic and had no flashing lights that one would expect to see on a traditional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was at an altitude that I would estimate at between 2,000 to 3,000 feet and appeared to be travelling parallel to the ground, not increasing or decreasing in altitude.  The object appeared similar to a rocket, although all that I was able to make out was the flame.  The flame was distinctly red and lacked the white or yellow colorations that I have seen when observing several shuttle launches! .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was heading towards the Potomac Maryland area.  The object was flying in a straight path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a financial services executive and have never previously reporting anything of this nature.  Given the security parameters in place in the Washington DC area, I would hope that someone would have information on this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting it in hopes that someone can provide me with an explanation of what this very unusual object was.  It was flying low enough that it should have emitted some type of sound and I was amazed that I could hear no noise at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the red coloration was very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Would appreciate any information.<n>

When it got over, I took our dog outside for his nightly walk in the yard.  I looked up in the sky to the east of our house and noticed about 7 or 8 orange balls floating sporadically in the sky all heading to the south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly called to the rest of the family in the house where they all came running out to see what was outside. Everyone, 6 members, also saw the lights floating in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireballs were originally floating at different levels and intervals, then continued floating in a semi-circle formation to the south east where after about 5 minutes of witnessing this, they just simply flickered out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear with no visible clouds.  The moon was nearly full.  The temperature was about 60 degrees with a very slight breeze.  No precipitation at all.<n>

From where we are located, we have an unobstructed view of the western sky. On the night of Saturday August 28, 2010, the skies were clear with temps in the low 70&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 9:25 that evening, I went outside to get something out of my truck. We had been cooking and canning vegetables from our garden all day, and the house was quite warm inside. Noticing how pleasantly cool it was outside, I asked my girlfriend if she might like to come outside for a while to cool off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood down by the water, chatting and looking at the house lights from across the lake, something caught my eye in the west northwestern night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At an elevation of about fifty degrees, a bright white star-like object had suddenly appeared, seemingly out of nowhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had this object been stationary, and not as bright, I might have mistaken it for just a large star. But it was not stationary. It was moving in a northerly direction at what appeared to be a very high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about three or four seconds from the time it first appeared, it executed a very tight, almost flat, 180 degree turn to the south, and after proceeding in this new direction for another three or four seconds, it just as suddenly seemed to &#34;turn off&#34; again, just like someone turning off a light switch, and became invisible to our eyes once more in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please understand that when I used the word &#34;turn&#34;, I am not speaking of any kind of a turn in the conventional way.  This object, whatever it was, had managed to accomplish a complete and opposite change of direction in less than a second.  It&#39;s speed remained constant throughout the entire manuver, and it&#39;s motion can only be described as &#34;fluid&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood there in silence for perhaps fifteen seconds or so, trying to comprehend what this actually was that we had just witnessed, another bright white &#34;star&#34;  &#34;turned on&#34; in the west southwestern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took this to be the same object that we had seen before, as the size and light intensity were the same, as was it&#39;s elevation above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time however, the same manuver that we had just witnessed was being repeated in reverse, with the object making another of those &#34;impossible&#34; 180 degree turns, and heading back to the north again before &#34;turning off&#34; once more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there for several more minutes watching the sky, but it did not reappear again.<n>

Me and my girlfriend were driving down Riverside Dr. in sherman oaks, Ca @ 9:20pm and she pointed out these lights in the sky over the hill, south of us, which would have been over los angeles. the lights were spinning fast, and the angle that they were at was like a slanted angle. at first the lights looked like it was going away, then it started getting closer and did a crazy turn to the west. the lights were spinning very fast. and it looked as if there was several rows of lights. like a scrolling marquee.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a red light flashing with the object that i saw when i stopped the car in the middle of the street to look. it kinda looked like a helicopters red light flashing, like a beacon, i am not sure. usually i see that light on regular flying aircrafts. but this thing had lights, rows of lights, at this wierd slanted angle and the lights were rolling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, like i said, at first was going away from us, heading south, then it came back over the hill and it looked like it started following the 101 freeway westward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went home to get my camera and tried to find it but it was gone. i couldnt see it anywhere. i drove all the way to santa monica beach to se if i can catch it again. there had to have been people that saw these lights. it was a crazy, round object with lights all around it, rotating lights. i swear i wouldve thought it was a movie being filmed for a space ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Just as it was beginning to get dark I noticed some pulsing lights coming up from the direction south beyond Hawkins Creek within tree top level-(est. 600-700ft. away) from my slightly elevated position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was already walking westerly and a short moment later it appeared that the formation of blinking lights, UFO&#39;s(12-15) were going to be slightly west of my location.  The HPS lights on the towers had just illuminated moments before and I&#39;d only walked about 200 ft from the office building while passing under a light tower to get a better unobstructed view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were in a loose single file formation, some slightly higher, lower, or farther and closer. They seemed very close to me without any sounds being noticed or heard.  Perspective wise they were maybe the size of a finger or thumbnail held out at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The illumintated craft were each pulsing unsynchronized, first two beats warm red colored light near the center bottom surface of the craft, then two beats of a rose color somewhat wider spread out further, then lastly two beats of a ruby red color illuminating the furthest across the bottom surface.  The light pattern would repeaton each craft again and again evenly about every 5-7 seconds to complete.  It wasn&#39;t entirely dark yet and I couldn&#39;t see anything on the topside.  It seemed that the larger ruby colored flashing beats best revealed the overall oval shape of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO&#39;s were more visible to see farther away when approaching, because when I thought to start counting them, they were less visible and fading out fast at the front of the formation traveling away from me towards the northwest.  I thought maybe the event had ended when I turned around shortly before spotting 2-3 more of the same craft following the same flight path, spaced much farther apart, moving about the same speed, within about 20-30 seconds behind the main group.  The craft were not moving very fast and seemed very low and slow, maybe about 50-80 MPH, about 60 degrees above my horizon and less than a quarter of a mile away.  My location was about 500ft. above sea level.<n>

The colors changed from green to white, and 10 minutes later from red to white. It was hovering in a figure eight pattern horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then a second appeared beside it (occurring in the north east sky) moving in sync with the first flashing light. The color pattern of the second flashing light, which was blue and white, seemed to respond to the first flashing light, as they both moved in a figure eight pattern. It is possible that the lights were moving north-east, yet we are accounting for the earths rotation and duration of time, that they were stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have located Venus and Polaris so we know it is not a known celestial body. We have now lost sight of these objects and do not know if they have disappeared. (21:24 08/28/2010)<n>

My brother stayed in the car. as soon as we got out there was this fireball hovering over us it seem like it was 25 ft above us as we looked at it and started to point and talk about it and try to get my brother out the car it started to drift away pretty fast.  Within seconds it was a distance away and the fire went out the UFO went to black and started to slowly drift down like it was landing.  The trees got in the way and that was all we seen.  My brother got out the car so late that he didn’t see much of it so he thinks it was some government crap just to mess with our head.  I believe it’s a UFO I been begin for the day to see one and I finally did.  Now I want to see more of them.  I just wish I had a camera when I seen this.<n>
8/28/10 20:45|Davie|FL|Light|15 Minutes|South West Broward FL Orange Redish Lights Flyby on 8/28/2010 20:45|8/30/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77520.html|60|ndxe201008| South West Broward FL Orange Redish Lights Flyby on 8/28/2010 20:45<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near the flight path of where airplanes approach to land at Ft. Lauderdale international airport.  On a clear night if I look west I can see an aircraft approaching maybe out 30 miles or more.  As the aircraft proceeds to land I can see it all the way until about it reaches the airport approximately 15 miles east.  On ordinary nights I see several dozen planes go through.  I&#39;ve lived at this location for the last 10 years and I know the types of lights airplanes have.  Typically they have bright almost white lights for landing, and typically a blue, read or white flashing lights.   On this August night, it was about 830 PM and I just got home from work.  I live near I-75 and the Griffen Road exit in Broward county FL.  The conditions were partly cloudy with a very distant thunderstorm South East of my location approximately 25 or more miles in the area of North Miami Beach. I was on the phone when I noticed two bright light orange redish lights flying! sided by side approximately 10 miles south of my location.  The were flying at what appeared to be low speeds and in the midst of low level clouds.   The lights appeared to be bigger than what you would expect from lights shinning on an airplane at that distance.  They flew for maybe 1 minute heading west and then turned together toward the south. The light was directional for one of the objects and was not for the other.  In other words, as one of the objects turned south, its light turned with it.  The other object seemed to turn the light after it had turned south. They repeated the same flyby another 3 times.  The lights seemed to dim and then brighten as they flew by.  When the lights turned south there were no flashing strobe lights to indicate it was an airplane. My parents witnessed the lights from their car just south of my location less than a quarter mile away. I confirmed they saw and object with orange redish lights and they thought it was an airplane at first! , but my dad noticed there were no recognizable lights that a ! typical airplane would carry.  Still can&#39;t explain what it was, but would love to know if anyone else in the South West Broward area saw lights at the same time I did.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then the lights began to fade and disappear one by one.  We were headed to our friends house a few blocks away and as we turned the corner there was a car stopped in the road with the doors open.  Three teens were outside and were on a cell phone and I could hear the driver telling her mother that she really did see something.   At that point I rolled down my window and asked if they had seen the lights too and they excitedly said they saw the lights and that there were seven of them.<n>

The object looked very similar to the &#34;Space Shuttle&#34; only it would have had to have been 10 or 15 times the size of the space shuttle.  It was white and reflected a lot of light as if it was quite shiny.  If it wasn&#39;t a giant &#34;Blimp&#34; made in the shape of a very large space shuttle---then it was something that I have never seen before.  I called my wife on the cell phone because I knew she was traveling on a Washington State Ferry just leaving the downtown area of Seattle.  I asked her if there was a Huge Giant Blimp in the shape a space shuttle hovering over the city--she said she could see something similar to what I was describing but there were too many buildings and trees blocking her view to get a real good look at it.<n>

There was no sound and just one, solid, bright red light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it as I watched it move east of my position toward the north. It then flew farther north until I could no longer see it blocked by houses and trees. When I could no longer see it, I went back inside my house to my computer and posted the event on my facebook status.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I want to stress that I have seen and heard planes and helicopters fly around at night from my front porch, and the light I witnessed resembled nothing I have ever seen before. I&#39;m no stranger to hot air balloons either.

On Saturday, August 28, 2010, at approximately 6:00 a.m., I observed a very bright, odd-looking  “light” in the eastern sky near Orion’s belt.  It was brighter and larger than anything else in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light would glow bright and produce a huge halo around itself, then it would dim, in a very slow pulse. The light, when glowing bright, formed elongated spikes of light above and below the main part of the light. I got my binoculars to observe the light closer. With the binoculars, I could see in the center of the light three colored orbs: red, blue, green, positioned in a triangle to each other. In succession, each orb would glow bright, then dim (not flashing).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the light until the dawn made it impossible. During the entire time I watched the light it did not move its location in the sky; neither vertical nor horizontal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to observe the light the next morning at the exact same time and place but it was no longer there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius is to the left of, and below, Orion.

I decided to cut through 7 lakes drive on the ride home and then get on the Thruway. When we were driving on 7 lakes road (or drive?), my girlfriend was in the passenger seat looking out the window.  We passed the silver mine pond on the left and then the road took a small dip. I was going fairly slow, about 25 mph as to avoid deer.  About a ½ mile after we passed the silver mine parking lot we saw bright lights to the right as we approached a slight left turn.  I slowed down a little to about 5-10 mph so we could get a better look at what we saw.  About 50 feet out over a small lake we saw 6-8 red and green lights in a row formation about 10 feet long, just over the surface of the lake. As we got closer the lights moved at a somewhat brisk pace to the right on the water’s surface and turned off sequentially from left to right.  We only saw the lights for about 4 seconds before they disappeared completely.  There were no boats in the lake that either of us could see.  I don’t think there is a launch on that particular lake either.  We had the windows closed but there was no noticeable noise. We didn’t stop to turn around but instead drove onwards past other lakes but saw nothing over any of those. I told family members what I saw but no one had an explanation other than maybe a small boat someone was fishing off of. I know I didn’t see a boat though.  There was plenty of moonlight so I think either my girlfriend or I would have seen if there was a boat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My wife said to everyone &#34;look at that!&#34; we all turned to the southeast and witnessed a diamond shaped object pulsating red/orange moving slowly to the northeast, I was able to take a compass bearing on the object of 150*. I referenced the object with two pine trees at a range of approximatley 100m across a flat open field the object was situated at an elevation equivelant to two horizontal fingerwidths above the two pine trees the object steadily moved to a bearing of 120* paused for approximatley 2 seconds and then rapidly ascended to the east at a high angle of ascent and disapeared out of site. The weather was as follows: Skies-clear with abundent stars visible and the moon was a wanning gibbous providing significant lighting, enough so that I would expect an exhaust/vapor trail t! o be visible , Winds-Calm, Temperature-Approximatlety 60*F, Humidity-Low. The object made no noise, there was no trail of exhaust/vapor visible. I did not notice any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. I called the NUFORC hotline to report shortly after the incident occured. As we were in the process of setting up camp a camera was not readily accessible and I did not want to take my eyes off of the object. My exact location at the time of the incident was 41* 16&#39;21.7N 72* 35&#39;51.1W.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object viewed from binoculars appeared to be a single white light (not brilliant) viewed from front, side and rear, no sound while passing and no engine.  On 8/27/2010 while viewing it at 21:30 hours from my backyard I estimate it was approximately 2 miles away and even with me. I &#34;saluted&#34; it without the binoculars and the light faded out.  I lifted the binoculars and witnessed the light reappearing approximately ten miles away (in approximately three seconds) and then went out again. On the 28th and 29th the object reappeared traveling in the same direction. My wife witnessed it with me on the 28th.  On the 28th and 29th the light did not &#34;wink out.&#34;  As it was traveling in the direction of Selfridge Air Force Base I suspect it to be a predator drone ! or blimp, stealth fighter or experimental military aircraft considering the radar that would have captured it from the base and the jets that were availabe to scramble. Surprisingly I see no other reports and unusual that on three consecutive nights it has appeared. Last night, the 29th the light appeared less bright and more amber in color. During each viewing several aircraft could be seen in and around the vacinity at varying altitudes. I will be viewing to see if it reappears for a fourth consecutive night.<n>

The weather was very clear with a few scattered high altitude clouds in the west.   If facing west the object was first spotted at about the 11 o’clock position.  It was traveling in a straight line east to west and disappeared over the horizon in less than a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we thought it was a satellite, due to its speed and trajectory.   We quickly realized that it was much too large and bright to be a satellite and then thought it might be the space station.  Again this was discounted due to the size of the object.  It had to be very large and very high or it had to be at a much lower altitude and traveling faster than any airplane any of us had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a large white light or maybe several white lights close together forming what appeared to be a single light.  It was extremely bright and the shape of the object behind the lights was indiscernible.  There was absolutely no engine noise.  The object moved in a straight trajectory directly toward the sun, which had already set.  As stated the object was over the horizon in less than a minute.  I will not speculate as to its speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses to this event are extremely credible.  None of us had any guess as to what this object may have been.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  ISS at 21:20 hrs., but west to east.

While watching the object which was a very bright, white light, I could see it was making up and down moves.  I went in and got my binoculars while my neighbor watched it. We watched with the binoculars and could definitely see it moving downwards.  My neighbor noticed two other set of lights at the 10 O&#39;Clock and 2 O&#39;Clock positions above it.   The other two lights were red and green in color. While watching the bright light through the binoculars, it went from a single light to 5 lights in a pentagon shape, and then it went back to a solid light.   We watched it for about 30 minutes until it went below the tree line.  I live very near the Little Rock AFB, and the bright light was in the southwest of my house in the direction of the far end of the runway.  When the bright light dipped below the tree line, I could still see the two green and red object at the exact 10 and 2 positions above w! here the bright light dipped below the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coincidentally, two C-130 aircraft flew in after the bright light dipped below the tree line. They were flying in the direction of the bright light, and then they did a U-turn over the base and flew in the opposite direction of the light.  Coincidence??  No C-130s in the area while the bright light was glowing.  I tried to take a photo, but couldn&#39;t focus on it with the digital camera. I got one blurry photo.<n>

I observed a triangular (almost airplane-like) object hovering in the sky above my vehicle.  As I proceeded down the highway at roughly 65mph, the craft did not seem to get any closer or farther away.  Also there was no noise coming from the craft for it being so close.  This particular craft most resembled a modern day airplane, with two exceptions:  The craft appeared to have a dorsal-type fin on the center top, and had no turbines.  It also had a matte-black finish that strangely appeared to be matte and shiny all at the same time.  I observed the craft for roughly 15-20 seconds, when I took a second to re-focus on it, the “plane” simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oddly enough, since this sighting I have noticed that when driving I can hear the sounds of an aircraft hovering above my vehicle.  I can never see anything, yet can hear the noise so loudly that I cannot hear the radio or hear my son speaking to me from the back seat.  My husband has several “explanations” for this.  However, the sound does not occur when I have passengers other than my son riding with me.  Not sure if this is a coincidence, but it is a little unsettling nonetheless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> **I sighted this object no less than 2mi North of the Mid-county toll plaza.<n>

I was sitting in the front passenger seat while watching the sky, we were traveling about 75 miles an hour when I noticed them.  They appeared to be just outside of Chattanooga to the South of the city.  Due to being on a road trip, the driver and I had no time to stop and watch them, longer than they were plainly visible from the vehicle.  We did see fireworks going off about ten minutes prior to the event, however, given our speed and ground covered, the orbs were not in the same vicinity as the fireworks. I called a friend to file this report.  (The report was dictated in real time via phone call)<n>

To give perspective, we were on 43rd and Decatur.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caught our eye was that there were no running lights on this vehicle (I am not a pilot, but I think it is a big no-no to fly through the city without any lights on, but I may be wrong).  As it approached from the west, traveling about the speed of a helicopter or small plane, we kept waiting to hear some kind of engine noise to help us know what we were seeing (Police helicopter, Traffic reporter, etc).  We never heard any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we never heard any sound, we thought that maybe our depth perception was off and it was actually flying higher than the 1000-2000 foot altitude than we thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it continue to fly east.  It went behind some small clouds and never came out in any direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My partner and I are pretty skeptical and are reluctant to classify this as a &#34;UFO&#34;.

I was looking out the window in a north east direction and contemplating taking my telescope out to view the night sky as the moon was very bright in the eastern sky low above the trees. I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia when there was a bright star that began to descend from the constellation. As it descend it got brighter and very large then began to move in a north eastern direction rapidly.  The total experience was less than 1 minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Background: I often lay on my couch watching television and look out a 6’wide by 10’ high sliding glass patio doorway.  When looking out the sliding glass doors I am facing in a north eastern direction.  My wife and I live somewhat near the O’Hare Airport and are in the direct line of incoming and outgoing air traffic.  So, I am very familiar with aircraft and their appearance both in daylight and dark night skies.  I have seen aircraft flying low and high and feel I can tell the difference between aircraft and what I saw on 8/26/2010 at 9:03pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9:03pm 8/26/2010: I had spent the evening noticing how the sky was clear and how the moon was very bright and low in the eastern sky. At approximately 8:50pm CST I noticed a bright star below the moon and wondered if it was a planet.  I took a walk back into a spare room where I keep my 10” Orion Dobsonian Telescope. But as it was going to be too much trouble to take it out of the storage closet I decided against it.  I walked back to the living room and lay upon the couch and was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia and noticed that from out of view above the sliding glass door a star was getting brighter and looked as though it was descending directly from the constellation. Over the next few second the star got very large, bright white and began to slow its descent. At this point I called for my wife in our bedroom reading a book to please look out the window, as the bedroom window are on the same north eastern facing wall.  She said she could not see a thing, as I assumed she had alrea! dy closed the drapes as she always does. As this conversation was happening the object had gotten very large and stopped descending. It was at a magnitude I have never witnessed before.  My wife did come out of the room and asked what I wanted her to see, as my request was unusual and I was shocked at what was happening and I think she could hear that in my voice.  I continued to observe the object and it got suddenly got very bright and moved in a north easterly direction rapidly.   When she joined me at the sliding glass door, I pointed out the object and she said “you mean that star”.  When my wife said “you mean that star”, the object had already become about an 15th of its largest size and had moved out and away from us. It moved rapidly and then disappeared into the sky in that same direction.  She said it probably was plane, but she had not witnessed the full event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conclusion: In the two years I have been living here and observing the night sky and passage of commercial planes I have never witnessed anything like this before.  The object I saw was round and moved like nothing I had ever seen before.  It descended rapidly from what appeared to be a small star to a large round object. It hovered for a second before rapidly moving out of sight.  There were no blinking lights on the object like on the commercial craft that fly overhead constantly.  And as this was a clear night I am an amateur astronomer I cannot identify what it was that I witnessed. My only conclusion would be to say that this was an UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There were three of us in a car heading west on Saginaw Hwy. Person 1 is sitting in the passenger seat, person 2 is driving, and person 3 is sitting in the middle back seat. It was around 8:40PM, the Sun  was just under the horizon almost centered with the road no stars were visible yet. Person 1 noticed a light that was approx. 60-80 degrees vertical, and 100-120 degrees horizontal (90 degrees being centered with the road) which was really high in the sky and could be easily confused as a Star/Planet. At first it was thought to be Mars because of the reddish orange tint. Person 1 announced that there was a light in the sky when he noticed it was to close to be a star/planet, the other two started looking for it. Person 2 located the light, then the two noticed that the light was moving slowly flying in different directions at will and slowing down and resuming speed.  They also witnessed it dim ! until not visible, then fade back in, then faded back out.  Person 3 noticed the light fade back in while simultaneously the other two noticed another light higher and brighter than the original and getting brighter, thinking it was the original. At this point the three thought they were looking at the same light, person 1 and 2 kept saying, “ It’s getting brighter!”  Person 3 noticed that he was looking at a different light because the one he was looking at was getting dimmer then disappeared then reappeared then he noticed they were looking higher up in the sky and had to lean forward to see the other light which was really bright. Then person 3 yelled, “oh! There’s two of them!” Person 1 noticed the original light, it took person 2 a little longer to find it because he was driving. We watched the lights move around, and vary in brightness then the brighter 2nd light started to head south, the other light soon followed they accelerated way  faster than we had seen them trav! el previously, and as they flew they faded out. The 1st dimmer! light w as out of sight first. We were unsure if the lights were produced from inside or reflections of the sun. This all happened within a few minutes. We kept looking in the sky for the lights but never saw them.<n>

I thought it was nothing more than a satellite at first glance.  They move just a bit slower though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was the brightest thing in the night sky, and if I was to measure the thing, I estimate around  the size of an apartment building.  This light was intense.  It had height, width, and depth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend and I watched this bright light move from the Southeast, toward the east for about a minute, and then it changed direction three separate times, almost a slow zig- zig.  Like it was crawling in the sky, then it moved faster toward the South, (heading over Springfield for about 4 more minutes?<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then saw what looked like jets going after this object, like it was trying to chase it.  The jets couldn’t keep up with it though, it proceeded to increase speed and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve seen some pretty explainable things in the sky at my home before, just nothing like this.<n>

I was facing north. At a distance (I’m not good at gagging distances,) I noticed a small pin point of what appeared to be a cloud.  It was tiny. This “dot” of cloud began expanding rapidly. It caught my attention and, while still staring at it, I called my mother. I pointed to the cloud and asked her to look at it, that the cloud was forming a fast pace. She did and, was as amazed as I was. A cloud formed out of nowhere! All of a sudden an object of some sort flew out of the cloud. My mother wondered if it was a bird. I responded: must be a huge bird, to be visible at that distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that moment another object flew out of the same cloud that had just formed. My mother then ran inside grabbed her binoculars and watched as a third object flew out. The first object was heading towards us, the second headed East and the third, headed west. The objects disappeared in front of our eyes. They just banished. My mother told me that through the binoculars, the objects seemed to be metallic, triangular and looked reddish.  With the naked eye, it appeared round. It was a sunny afternoon with no clouds. The color she noted could have been the sun’s reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should note that a few years ago, my then fiancée and I witnessed a huge fireball that was traveling at a great speed.  It stopped midair as it changed colors. It got real bright, brilliant colors and “imploded.” It did not fly away or fall. It just imploded within itself. It left a thin trail of vapor or smoke. I am glad both times I’ve witnessed these occurrences, I have not being alone. Otherwise I would doubt my sanity.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One was coming from the south toward the road we were traveling on.  The other came from the north. Initally I thought it was two planes and I told my wife that they are going fast toward one another and they were going to hit. They came very close in front of us down the road (up in the sky) and almost hit...then the one that came from the north turned and headed due west at a high rate of speed.  The other light stopped and turned and headed south at a high rate of speed.  The lights were circular a bright blue/white twice the size of a planet in the night sky.  I know these were not planes or helicopters.<n>

I had been looking at the stars, particularly the big dipper, before I fell asleep and happened to look at it again above the minivan.  A large light, larger than the stars which compose the big dipper, but appeared almost as distant, streamed through the constellation at a very high rate of speed.  I thought it might have been a shooting star, but it wasn&#39;t moving fast enough.  Once it reached a spot below the big dipper the light dimmed slightly, and then moved back and forth (left and right) in its descent, almost playfully, before taking a straight course again and I eventually lost it over what I believe was Canada.  It was heading a due north course.  The color was white, the shape was round, and the object moved and dimmed. This was not a plane.  As soon as I saw it I knew what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Then it got smaller, smaller, smaller, and finally disappeared.  It came back, bright as it was before and it started moving in odd motions to distinguish it from a shooting star.   After whisking across the sky it turned red and got very close to the moon.  Soon after that it became its brightest again and it stayed right beneath our sight of the moon for about three hours.

The airplane was traveling North to South. When we looked at the object with binoculars it apperaed to be a bright white circular spaped object but there were no red or blue flashing lights on it.

I tried to watch it more, but the tree line obscured my view. I ran over to my  brothers house to get my mother to see it, but she was on the phone and couldn&#39;t leave.

This made it it stranger because for being so close we could not make out what it was at all. Just lights. It made a small whirring or humming noise.  It had a green blinking light.  We thought perhaps it was a remote helicoptor or plane however, its movments were what was very odd.  We are in a wooded space and it navigated through the trees and branches fluidly.  We tried to watch it then it appeared to vanish from the same place it was in sky.<n>

It was hovering upward direction at a 7 oclock angle to a 2oclock angle it jumped 2000ft in altitude by the time i looked in a different direction and back to the same direction I thought their would be more UFO&#39;s thats why I changed directions and it was higher in altitude I snapped a picture using my iphone it was so far away it does not appear on camera I still have the picture on my phone but it just appears as clouds but what was actually suppose to be in the picture was a bright mirror like object hovering and pulsating white lights. so I started walking up to my friend! s around 6:42 am and by the time I walked back down his drive way into my drive way the object seemed to of vanished I looked higher in the sky nothing it was as if it was not even their.<n>

It appears at about 10pm pacific rising from the horizon to the east to about midway in the sky, then changes course and heads south for about an hour, then changes course again and heads west.  It travels very slowly, taking about 3-4 hours to cross the sky, but moves considerabley faster than any star in the sky. Each time it changes course it pauses for about ten or so minutes and looks to wobble slightly back and forth bfore continuing. Ive checked star maps and i can see nothign indicating a star or planet anywhere near this brightness in the sky in that direction. Its really creeping me out!   Before a month ago ive never seen it before and ive lived here for my whole life, and after the first sighting, it dissapeared for a full week (i scanned the sky every night for hours) and re appeared exactly one week later at almost the exact same time and has been out almost every day since, with the exception of it dissapearing a couple times and re appearing later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter sighting.

It seemed to wobble side to side a little.   It took about 60 seconds to travel the majority of the sky, and may have made one minor direction change.  As it moved off in the distance it all of a sudden shut off the bright light and seemed to have a red glow before we could no longer see it.  I think it was some sort of supersonic aircraft that was flying along with its afterburners then shut them down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Then moments later I saw this strange light ahead (east) I was thinking it was another airplane but it didn&#39;t had blinkig lights and it was to bright, one big round light and two small ones on the sides, there was a full moon and it was a clear night, I saw that strange object like next to the moon then a few seconds later like 3 or 4 seconds later it star going up slowly and for some reason I look to my speedometer to see how fast I was driving, I just looked down for a split second and when a look up again that light was gone, I looked all over the sky and there was no light at all, I kept looking, nothing, it was gone. I would like to know if there is somebody else that saw this light.<n>

8/24/10 20:00|Nashville|TN|Circle|30 minutes (+or-)|Silent White Orb UFO followed by other Unidentified Craft|8/30/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77420.html|138|ndxe201008| Silent White Orb UFO followed by other Unidentified Craft<n> <n><n> <n><n> August 24, 2010 On August 24, 2010 around 8 pm or so, my girlfriend and I were relaxing outside our apartment in West Nashville, TN.  The sky was clear, with a full moon illuminating the sky considerably.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While looking at the moon we witnessed a very bright, solid white, orb-like object float into our field of view.  We don’t know where it originated from as it seemed to have simply appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the light, we witnessed it accelerate fluidly and slow down just the same.  The object was able to make left, right, up, and down movements while changing altitudes quickly.  This object was totally silent, and it traversed the length of our house, but must have been at least a couple of miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then moved behind the trees just behind our house.  Yet, being as bright as it was, we were still able to maintain visual contact and track its movement.  We were at this point standing on my neighbor’s porch, my girlfriend on my right, when the object vanished.  Simultaneously, a shooting white light shot off into space faster than lightening.  The light trail was almost imperceptible to the eye, and it’s duration a fraction of a second.  Almost like a reverse shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, we were stunned because we knew it was like nothing we had ever seen.  As we sat and discussed the object/light, we continued watching the sky. It couldn’t have been mo re than 5 or ten minutes since the other object vanished when we began to see multiple high-altitude aircraft flying towards the area where the object had been.  These aircraft made no sound, and had blue and red quick flashing/blinking lights.  These lights flashed quickly and they appeared to be set in a rectangular shape or pattern.  One after another, these aircraft continued to appear at what looked like the same altitude and speed; the latter being hard to estimate.  At one point, it appeared these craft were assuming a triangular formation or were flying in a formation directly above where we witnessed the first object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimate seeing at least 10 of these aircraft, and I do not believe these were commercial aircraft.  I think it’s possible they were military in nature, and that they also may have been circling the area.  These aircraft eventually disappeared, maintaining the same direction, speed, and altitude.<n>

I was looking at one of the amusement park rides and noticed ascending right above it was a silver flashing metallic object that appeared at first glance to be a (chrome)  mylar balloon rising up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then began to rise at a much faster rate and the flashing of silver light became brighter not dimmer with altitude gain.  The object rose straight up at least 500 feet from where I first saw it and was not affected by any winds aloft that would usually sway a balloon horizontally.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object than became fixed in the sky in a perfect stop/non swaying motion and continued to pulse with flashes of silver going dim to very bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some employees from a neighboring business had just come out the back of their building and I pointed the object out to them, the three of us watched for a few more minutes as the object continued to stay fixed in the ! sky as it pulsed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the pulse stopped and the object was completely gone.<n>

About 10:00 am  I saw an oblong or possibly triangular white object overhead while looking westward driving downtown.  It was headed in a southeasterly direction, behind a tall apartment building.  I turned and headed southward on the next street and looked into the sky but didn’t see anything.  It was a blue sky and very clear day.  There were no objects in the sky at all, including planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran a quick errand after which, about 10 minutes later, I was in my car parked in a large parking lot a couple of miles southwest of downtown Visalia.  While parked, I looked for no particular reason out the driver’s window to my left.  An object in the sky caught my attention.  I looked up and saw what appeared to be a white object, definitely not a plane, headed overhead in a northward direction.  The shape was kind of triangular and I watched as it passed overhead past a freeway and continued on a northward trajectory appearing almost to turn over in a ‘hurtling’ manner.  I don&#39;t know what its elevation was.  I watched it until I couldn’t see it anymore.  What came to mind was that earlier object. Also, I hadn’t heard nor seen any planes overhead in the time I had been outside that morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought they must be planes or jets but they move faster than that and the whole thing is bright, like the sun is shining on it, but not. There are usually 2 at a time, with some distance between them. I usually see them over Table Rock.  I have seen them at all times of the day but usually early morning or evening.  I have never reported anything before and I suppose I could be wrong but it has happened so often and it leaves an unsettling feeling in me.  I don&#39;t know what I believe about aliens but it can&#39;t hurt to just let you know what I have seen.  Thanks.<n>

It was difficult to zoom into the craft itself with my camera, but the jetstreams are very apparent. The craft was launching into the sky north of where I was seated on the beach, perhaps near the canyons. I also filmed a video to show how quickly it was rising. I contacted Vandenberg AFB and they said they did not launch anything that day and will not until September.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Photo shows contrails behind a twin-engine airliner.

I yelled to the friend closest to me that there were two bright lights low to the ground. As soon as i pointed out the orbs started to come closer together and one picked up speed and left our view and the other started to move back and forth.  I yelled for my friends to come up to the tree so they could see it and we all watched it move back and fourth for 5 minutes before it disapeared behind a house.  When this happend, we all got down from my tree and ran towards the corner of my block to get a better view of the craft.  As soon as we got to the cprner, it flew directly over us and it was then that i could get a better view of it.  It was a perfect oval with a very bright white glow that i could see on the ground as it flew past. It had small black dots in the front of it that curved all the way around to about the middle of! the ship, looking like a C.  After we ran around the block trying to see it again, we say 3 fighter jets which we believed to be f-16&#39;s fly over my house in the same direction that the craft had gone.  This was about 10 minutes after the 2nd craft had disappeared from view.  That was the last of the activity we saw that night.<n>

He called me out after he had watched it fly quickly from one spot in the sky to another then stop, hover and go in circles.  he siad he saw it shoot something from it.  It was due west from our back porch.SO I came out to take a look.  It appeared to be over Huntsville Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a 2 hour period this thing hovered,went in circles horizontaly, pulsed in brightness and in size. It moved VERY quicly back and forth stood perfectly still and shot out something that shined very brightly at least twice, we both saw it happen the 2nd time.  Then the ejected object invisible, turned off its lights or burned up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the time went on, it dropped lower than our trees.  We lost sight of itat approx 1AM.  I sat in my chair and anchored myself, because I thought maybe  My eyes were playing tricks on me.  But they were not!  This was definalty not a plane, not a helicopter, not a star, not a planet.  It appeared to have a glowing aura around it at times and I did see beams, now I dont know if that was coming from the craft or from a helicopter around it that might have been flying without its running lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was perfectly clear and it was in my sight for at least 2 hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope others saw this and report it too!<n>

I knew it was not a planet, star, satellite, etc.  The planet Venus popped into my head, but every few minutes, they was a light red object that would circle around the white object.  Practically looked like it would come out of the white object, do a little peek show, and then disappear and this carried on for an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As time went on, the white light was slowly but gradually moving north/northeast-ward.  I was holding my Camcorder thinking to myself, &#34;I have to get this on film&#34;.  I recorded everything I saw and had experienced.  My father had come outside to see it for himself and he was shocked to what he was indeed looking at, it was nothing that i had seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 11:15 PM my parents had gone inside for just a moment while im standing outside alone now, and the white light that was a solid circle had broken apart, making 3 circles appear into the shape of a triangle. to the left side of that, 2 more lights had came to join looking like it was going into the triangle form.  They were both a light shade of a green color with a white tint to them.  When my parents had joined me again, they saw the last end of it, which was, it shot behind the tower it was next to.  Within two minutes, it had shot up above the tower, back into its original form, a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Throughout the night, the red object would appear next to the white object and then disappear.  At 11:45 PM, my parents and I decided to go into a field that was close by to get a better look and sure enough, it was gone.  I did not get to record it because it happened to quick but my mother had seen it and she was stunned, speechless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the young woman, who submitted this report, and we found her to be an exceptionally sober-minded, objective witness.  We suspect that her report is a quite accurate rendition of what she, and her parents, witnessed.  PD))<n>

It was hovering just above the tree line about 5 degrees to the east of the north star.  The blueness is what caught my attention.  Very soon after noticing it, it began to dip and sway and swirl like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got the attention of another patron at the store and asked him if he saw it too.  He said he saw it, but didn&#39;t seem too impressed. It slowly dropped below the tree line and I didn&#39;t see it again.<n>

Decided to run and grab my wifes Canon Rebel XST camera so I could get a few shots of the clouds using a zoom lens.  I was bare footed and climbed on some small landscaping rocks near the pool to get higher so the block fence wouldn&#39;t be in the way.  I took a total of eight photos within less than two minutes.  When I downloaded the photos I noticed the first four had an object moving through the photos at a downward angle to the left.  I seemed to be fairly distant as I never saw it with my eyes.  It probably only took me 30 or 40 seconds to take the first 5 or 6 photos because the rocks were hurting my feet and I wanted to get down to the pool deck where I took about two more.  I showed my wife and she thought I might have had something on the lens. If I did it came off quick because the last four photos do not show the object.  I zoomed in on ! the photos to see if I could detect a shape. Two looked oval and the other two appeared to have a saucer shape.  I have no idea what it is but it is strange and I don&#39;t think anything was on the lens.  I have the unalterd photos if you want them.<n>

The brightness fluctuated which seemed awkward for a air craft to change altitude so much. When first spotted it was near Cassiopeia heading towards the constellation Taurus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was over head I spotted no additional or flashing lights and after it was heading away it remained just as bright which alerted to me this was not the landing gear of an air craft.  Just after passing Taurus now heading towards Orion the light was extinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not wish to disclose my background, but I am law enforcement related.  I was just outside smoking a cigarette getting ready to head for work.<n>

The course was pretty linear at first, but I noticed a few minutes later that it had started to zigzag.  The effect was very minor, as one wouldn&#39;t notice if one weren&#39;t staring directly at it. After a minute or so of zigzagging, it parked in the air for about five minutes, then began again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After another few minutes of movement, it parked again.  After about ten minutes of staring at it, I had to go back into the house, and wasn&#39;t able to see it again.  The entire time I was watching it, it looked like a bright star or a plane.  It had a white-blue glow, and it pulsated with a red glow.  The final time I stared at it, I could swear that I could see barely visible points of light dancing off to its side.  There was no sound, no distinguishable shape, and it didn&#39;t touch down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Tryed to get into the first entrance of the camping ground around 11:20pm. It was locked so we started following the signs which were the color brown that said campground hoping we would find another way into the park. I am pretty sure we were actually on killens pond road at this time. When my girlfriend stopped the car to get her flip flops out of the back. I was still sitting int the car. I got impatient and got out of the passenger side. Cause we were not completely off the road she had pulled up on the right hand side of the road but the left hand side of the car was sticking out into the the road and she had the back door open. About 20 feet over the tree lines was this pretty big traingle and about 50 feet to 75 feet on back of all the lights in this odd shaped traingle was this blinking red light making this vehicle the size of a football field not making a sound. I was screaming ufo my girlfriend ! was just saying o my god o my god. It wasn&#39;t hovering but wasn&#39;t moving right either. It&#39;s hard to explain. It was like the way it went out below the trees it was changing shape. I seen houses in that direction and im hoping someone else got a look at this again we were on the road with the brown signs that say campgrounds looking over to the left side was a huge field then the tree line and houses. I was standing in the middle of the road after the thing disappeared and not one car passed the whole time. If someone in delaware seen this thing I would like you to contact me, I live in upstate new york. The only reason why this is so unbelievable to me is cause it was so big and so close and it did not make a noise, nothing it was so swift. The lights were not extremely bright but I really couldn&#39;t get the shape of it. I know that red light in the back of it was connected by the way it moved with the object. But it was like it was so far away and out of place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

There was a white light that was blinking fast, and a red light on the rear that appeared to be moving back and forth, I could not hear any sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not observe this through the telescope because of how fast it was moving, and i should also mention the telescope is very heavy, so it is difficult to move it around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving northbound, and as it got about five or six miles to the northwest, it started to decend, and it eventually disappeared behind some trees, possibly landing at the Lawrenceville-Vincennes airport in Illinois, and if so, was probably just an airplane, but the object made no sound at all, so i am not quite for sure what it was.<n>

It is a very small airport that does not handle large aircraft or carrier lines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At roughly 9:45pm CST my wife and I were in our front yard.  We were walking past the front of our house passing south when we saw two odd shapes in the sky, quickly followed by one, then another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best description is that all four shapes were identical, and looked like fireballs, each of which cast a tail of radiation in its wake that made each object look vaguely like a glove with the fireball at the palm and the fingers (four or five) trailing in the wake (my wife saw something very similar, but not in as much detail).  They were orange-yellow, about the shade of fire you&#39;d see from a campfire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no way of gauging their size nor distance from the earth&#39;s surface, except to say that 5 or 6 of them grouped together would have been enough to blot out the moon from our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We initially saw one of the shapes moving directly overhead, due south.  Then another shape seemed to appear directly overhead (or simply fly into our field of vision), then another.  At around the same time we observed the third shape overhead, we realized there was another such shape further off in the southern sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All four shapes continued rapidly due south until they disappeared from our sight.  They did not disappear over a horizon, nor were they obstructed by trees or buildings, but rather they seemed to fly straight off into the sky until they became too small to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We initially thought they may be skydivers, but couldn&#39;t explain the intense fire.  We also thought they might be hot air balloons, but we both concluded they were moving fast enough that we couldn&#39;t hope to catch them in our truck, even if we drove rapidly in a straight line after them.  We heard no sound from them whatsoever.<n>

I looked up into the sky as I heard a jet over head. I saw the jet, as it passed I saw two round white objects I thought were birds; I stopped my bike to look.  They both were intertwining with each other in a circular fashion, then they would move apart a little, then intertwine again as they moved south west.  After a few seconds of watching,  One object dimmed and then turned silver, and then disappeared.  The other object went very fast to the west for a second then almost stopped and then just drifted off to the west, it did disappear at one point then reappeared. I then lost sight of it.  By the way these objects were not near the jet they were probably a mile or so closer to me that the jet.<n>

Initially I dismissed the objects as airplanes as Switzerland lying at the crossroads of Europe sees lots of air traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial assessment was deemed incorrect on the basis of other aircraft moving across the sky at altitudes that made it clear that they were indeed aircraft (shape, contrails, speed of movement).  The four objects remained almost motionless, until I witnessed a smaller and less bright object break or drop away from one of the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point (after five minutes of viewing) I determined it necessary to gather other witnesses.  I went into my house and asked my girlfriend to come outside with me, and to bring a camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we returned outside, the 4 objects were now 3 and we watched them for approximately 10 more minutes before going inside to look for another camera with! a telephoto lens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects moved slowly, and were hard to see against the brightness of the clear summer sky, often fading into the blue back ground and then returning with intensity in a new location making it difficult to judge their exact location.  The objects moved closer to each other over time, one after the other, never at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped two other passing strangers to confirm that they could also see the objects, which after a moment of searching (again, bright white objects on a bright blue sky) they found and confirmed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my girlfriend and myself went inside to look for my camera and telephoto lens.  Upon returning outside the objects had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Photos taken with the smaller digital camera reveal nothing of value.<n>

No one was in front of me and no one was behind me. It was pitch black dark and I was the only person in my car. I was driving calmly when I see a reddish light on the right corner of my front mirror. At first I think it’s another car that is beside me but I look and there’s nothing so then I lean forward and see three red lights in a triangular shape above the trees about a quarter mile into the forest. At first I think it’s the street lights, but lights don’t go that deep into the forest and they are not red. So I proceed to stare at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not stop to further investigate because I wanted to get home as quickly as possible and I was a little scared cause in the back of my mind I was thinking that maybe it’s a UFO.  So I just look at it for maybe 30 sec when I pass it.  Then maybe one minute or two, I see reddish shining light behind me about half a mile away.  This light had a tiny blinking yellowish light in the middle of it.  At first I thought it was a car, but I remembered that car lights are yellow so then I started to get scared because this light was following me at the same distance for about two minutes.  From my rear view mirror I can see that this light is just above the road, but the light was big and wide enough not to be a car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about two minutes pass, I pass the Snoqualmie Pass and come close to street lights and a semi on the northbound side. I look at my rear view mirror and the light is gone.<n>

Round, white but not reflective, no noise and at first I thought it might be a parachute from the aircraft.  But after a few seconds it was obvious it was not an aircraft.  From when I saw it to when it was out of view was between 1 and 1.5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My niece was outside at the same moment and she saw it too.

I live in Santa Rosa, CA.  It was right after I left Wal-mart In Windsor, Ca, (just a few towns north of Santa Rosa).  There was an Airshow going on at the Santa Rosa Charles Shultz Airport and as my girlfriend and I were walking out of walmart we were looking in the sky towards the west direction watching a jet in the sky.  Once it was out of sight we got into the car and proceeded to drive home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before getting on the freeway heading west on Shiloh road in Windsor Ca, myself and one passenger in my car both witnessed a very strange craft in the sky about 1000 feet ahead of us.  It was flying really low, maybe 100 to 200 feet max. above the road.  It was a cylinder object with a fan looking propeller device at the back end of it. Instead of a propeller on the front of it like a normal looking plane.  It was a bright silver, almost white looking color. It looked to be about 20 or 30 feet long by 10 to 15 feet wide-(about ! the size of a personal 1 to 2 man plane)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said there was an airshow going on so I was kind of looking towards the sky when it happened, and so when I saw it I thought to myself am I really seeing this?- what is this thing flying so low and it seemed to be moving at a good speed but I could see it so clearly.  And as I thought that my friend riding in the passenger seat yelled out &#34;look at that!&#34; and we were both in such awe because we think we just a ufo.  It was wierd it looked like something that would&#39;nt even be able to fly.  I had her describe to me what she saw and she explained it the same as me.  We both went home and drew out what it looked like but she doesnt really want to look like a crazy person. Our drawings look just about similar.<n>

I have always been interested and have observed/studied different aircraft and can usually make out what kind of aircraft in is in the sky.  One of the objects stayed stationary in the sky while the other was moving at a relatively slower speed (and very smoothly through the air) than a typical jet type passenger aircraft and heading south. The moving object seemed to disappear or I just lost visual sight of it after about 5 minutes. The object would speed up and slow down during the 5 minutes of observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After losing sight of the first moving object, I looked back at the other object and it was still motionless in the sky. It appeared to be a star (Which was strange considering stars are not usually visual during this time of day with the sun still shinning bright) because it was so still in the sky. After what seemed to be 2 minutes, this second object began to move south in the sky as well about the same speed as the first. This object would also speed up then slow down and make slight turns while ultimately keeping a flight path towards the south. After losing sight of this object because of trees, my wife and I went to sit in the spa. Almost immediately after getting into the spa I noticed the object out of the left corner of my eye towards the east of me and was heading north. It seemed the object had made a complete 180 degree turn. The object was a little lower in the sky towards the horizon and was much bigger at this point. It seemed to be a white sphere that was sh! inning bright in the sky. After observing the object heading north for about 5 minutes, we again lost sight of it because of trees obstructing our view. I did not have a camera on me at the time so unfortunately no pictures were taken of these objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Exactly one week later at 12:00 noon on Saturday August 21, 2010 while walking out to my vehicle, I noticed the same type of bright white “star-like” “orb” object in the distance northern sky (Altitude, size of the object, and distance unknown). I immediately ran into the house to grab my camera and told my wife to come out in order to confirm what I was seeing. She did confirm seeing the object in the sky and I was able to record a video of it as well as take some pictures. Also, something strange happened when I uploaded the pics of the object to my computer. When I zoomed into the object, I noticed many more of these strange &#34;White Balls.” These other objects were smaller, but I believe this was due to being further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After my experience observing these unidentified aerial objects and finding so many other videos and pictures of the same types of aerial objects online from all over the world, I am almost convinced this is something that is extraterrestrial in origin. I am truly amazed at how many other pics and videos from around the world show the same type of objects that my wife and I have observed. It seems out of all the videos and pics I have seen thus far after researching this subject for the past couple of weeks, it seems this type of object shows up more than any other unidentified sightings. Interesting considering just a few weeks ago my wife and I were skeptical of this kind of stuff. We both have Masters Degrees in Business (M.B.A.) and our brains/minds are “pre-wired” to think logically and in a scientific manner. After going through a process of elimination in our minds, we just can’t seem to find an answer as to what this was.

8/21/10 10:45|Washington (near)|PA|Unknown|45 seconds|Large white craft seen on 1-70W during morning traffic|8/30/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77425.html|187|ndxe201008| Large white craft seen on 1-70W during morning traffic<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, August 21, 2010, I was driving to Wheeling, WV to attend a wedding.  At around 10:45AM, while approaching Washington, PA on I-70W, a large object in the northern sky caught my attention.  Since there was a bit of traffic and I was driving relatively slowly, I was able to observe the object for approximately 45 seconds. The first instant I saw it, I thought it must have been a very large, low flying jet of some sort, but further observation ruled that out.  The object was long, thin, tapered at each end, with a somewhat thicker section in the middle of the craft. It was a solid white in color and was flying at about 8 inches (visually) above the treeline.  It was at least five inches long at arm&#39;s length from end to end, and maybe about an inch maximum from top to bottom at the thickest part. Again, it appeared to be very large.  I could see that it was definitely gliding toward my general direction at a steady speed.  I could not distinguish the exact! shape of the craft as I was looking at an approaching object dead-on. In my opinion, it was probably a large disk or chevron-shaped craft.  There was no sound and I saw no contrail. It was very startling due to the size and nature of the object.  It was unlike anything I am familiar with seeing in the sky.  I was unable to see where it went after I drove past it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know for a fact that several other people had the chance to see this object, as there were many vehicles on the road at the time, the object was quite noticeable, and traffic was moving relatively slowly.  I&#39;m extremely curious to see if another witness might read this report and come forward with their own account.  Perhaps someone at a different vantage point was able to get a better view of the shape of the object.<n>

Aug/2010<n> <n><n> <n><n> On August 21st 2010 I was on Indian Rocks Beach Florida late into the night and early morning.  I was sitting and watching the waves on a beautiful clear night. I had been their most of the night and decided to wait and watch the sunrise. I was starring off into the Gulf when a moving light caught my eye to my right. I looked to see what appeared to be 3 bulbs of rust red light shaped like a large triangle moving at a slow but cruising speed around 400 or so feet above the water. The object was no more than 200 feet out off the beach and made no sound. As the object passed by I could not see any body or frame inside the triangle but it seemed to be 1 object. As the object passed the rust red lights dimmed and then faded away into darkness. It was very strange because the object was still pretty close and it just faded away! As I witnessed this event I knew I was seeing something extraordinary and took in as much as I could. After this happened I sat in amaze! ment and realized I had just witnessed a UFO. The whole experience was about 45 seconds and it was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. I served in the Air force and have been around aircraft, this was not one of ours. As for Air Plane headlights, I know these were not from a plane. It was close, flying low and cruising just off the coast in front of me. I have always believed in UFOs and intelligent life beyond earth but have never done any research until after this experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As always, my friend and I took a walk down to the playground of the neighboring Elementary School to swing.  We noticed a very bright light about 65 degrees from the ground.  The intensity was about like that of a street lamp, but there were none in the direction we were looking towards.  It was golden in color, with an orange outer ring.  We discussed whether it was an aircraft, but it was not moving. We noticed it was pulsating very gently. After walking closer to it, and farther away, we dismissed that it was some sort of hidden lamp, and we left after some time, thinking nothing more of it, and my friend went home.

Slowly moving downward towards the horizen line then stopped again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I changed my camera to video mode and started recording.  It then started moving left along the tree line in the distance prolly about 20 miles away or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then proceeded to follow it up the street walking 100-200 feet away from the house.  It would stop and move constanly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flickered several different colors at one point from blue to green to orange and red.  It was definately not a plane with blicking lights; this was way too big.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It eventually went below the tree line so we got into my dads truck and went to a higher point few streets over and I started recording it again.  It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as it sat still for about 5 minutes then it proceeded to go below the horizen line again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3 of us stood there in awe of what we just saw, all agreeing it was not a plane or helicopter.<n>

There was no sound.  The object looked like a large cigar.  I looked at it for a few minutes.  It did not move. I decided to drive home and get my camera.  I was only five minutes away from my home.

8/20/10 01:00|Alexandria|NY|Sphere|20-30 minutes|3 large, brilliant red-orange fireballs hovered over tree line silently in area of uninhabited woods and lake.|2/10/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87018.html|203|ndxe201008| 3 large, brilliant red-orange fireballs hovered over tree line silently in area of uninhabited woods and lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was staying at a cabin, far from any towns, on the northwest side of a quiet lake, near the far end, with several other people.  It’s a very quiet, private location near in upstate, NY, almost to Canada, near Alexandria Bay and the Thousand Islands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night, and I had my telescope out to view the moon. Jupiter rose and it was beautiful through the telescope with 3 moons clearly visible.  It rose higher and I left off looking for a while.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later, around 1AM, I went outside alone and noticed what appeared to be a large reddish-orange fireball just past the opposite shore of the lake, barely above the treeline.  It was about the size of a fingernail at arm&#39;s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for a few minutes, then ran inside to get my boyfriend, his kids, and my son, but the fireball was gone. Later around 2 AM, it appeared again, this time I got everyone right away and everyone saw them.  The first moved slightly and then there were 3 fireballs.  One slightly higher than the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fireballs stayed there for about 15 min. this time.  They looked to be actual fire, like burning spheres.  At first I thought there must be a factory there or something others locally knew about.  But it was odd because the night was silent and clear and the fireballs were completely silent.  The lake amplifies every sound so much that if a person were to talk on the other side of the lake, you could hear him or her clearly.   We occasionally hear coyotes howl in packs up there.  It’s very wild and out in “the middle of nowhere.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son, who was 20 years old at the time, would like me to report that what he saw appeared &#34;light and dark orange&#34; and  &#34;pearlescent&#34; in color.  He said it appeared to be swirling in itself, and he saw it as “above the mountains on the horizon.”   That is all that happened, and when I saw the person whose family owns the cabin, I asked about the fireballs, and he had no idea what I was talking about.  Further inquiry revealed no one else who knew anything about the fireballs or had seen them.  Also, I discovered that there is nothing but rocks, woods, and hills in that direction on the other side of the lake. Also, it is notable that I experienced this sighting and called these objects “fireballs” before I knew there were any other similar sightings around the country and the world.<n>

It could have been two really large crafts or two sets of two or three crafts blinking in patterns, constantly blinking back and forth, they two ‘sets’ of lights were moving at a slow speed, one due east and the other due north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights seemed to be like some sort of strobe light effect.  Occasionally a bright red light would appear in between the two objects as they moved apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other planes in the sky during the forty-five minutes that they flew.  None of the other objects blinking lights were as intense as these and none of the air planes zig-zagged back and forth and up and down as these did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the objects flew within a half mile of us a! nd appeared cigar shaped.  I went in to grab my video, but it unexpectedly didn’t work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the object disappeared over the horizon a military plane was spotted in the South west.  I trailed the same path as the craft.  Its lights were different, it made sound the first craft didn’t, it left a trail, the first craft didn’t.  They were both flying at the same altitude.<n>

Remained for 20 min or more then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 38 year old male Mental Health Professional. I have never claimed to have seen a UFO, nor am I sure what exactly I saw last night.  I&#39;ve come to this website to see if any other&#39;s witnessed what I saw or if there is some kind of reasonalble explanation.  While sitting in front of my home, I noticed a very bright white light whith a red hue low in the western sky.  At first I thought it was a low flying plane, as there is a small airport nearby.  But then I noticed it wasn&#39;t really moving. It was hard to determine if it was in our atmosphere or in space.  Then I began to think perhaps it was a very bright star or planet, but it just seemed too big for that and the red hue didn&#39;t make sense.  I couldn&#39;t really determine what it might be. I called to my wife and a visting friend who witnessed it as well. Star, plant, plane; they came to the same conclusion as me.  I called a neighbor and he and his family witnessed it as well. They had a pair of binoculars and ! indicated that it was round with a red hue.  They could not determine if it was in our atmosphere or not.  We watched it for about 15-20 minutes, and then it made an apparent wobble to the left and the white light disappeared.  You could then see a faint red twinkling hue in it&#39;s place.  At one point, about 3-4 min. following the bright light&#39;s disappearance, there was another flash or shimmer resembling the largewhite light that lasted about 2 seconds.  I watched the red twinkling hue for another 5-10 minutes before clouds moved in and obscured my view completely.  I live in North Asheville, and called a friend in South Asheville to see if he had noticed the light.  He, in fact, had noticed it while driving home, and had thought it to be an oddly large, bright planet.  He suggested that perhaps it was a large meteor.  I called the local paper shortly after to see if anyone else had reported it, but no one had at that time.<n>

I had just finished mowing the lawn and was sitting on the back porch having a phone conversation with my Dad.  It was quite bright and seemed to appear out of thin air.  That portion of the sky was visible to me the entire time I was on the phone and the object was noticeable as soon as it appeared.  The object seemed to stay in place, relatively motionless for the entire length of the sighting.  Being unsure of what the object was I had my fifteen year old son come outside and take a look.  He verified that the object seemed to be hovering in the same spot.  At that time I called a friend who was working approximately 6 miles from my location.  He proceeded outside and spotted the object from his location.  At that time I went inside the house to get a pair of binoculars to try and get a better view.  Being unable to locate my binoculars I utilized the clo! sest thing I had, which was a 12 power rifle scope (unattached from the firearm).  With the aid of the scope I could make out what appeared to be faint red lights around the circumference of the object.  We both observed the object for a period of approximately 45 minutes before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD))<n>

Going counter clock wise I seen what looked like the same satellite. A huge burst of light came out of the side of it and then I realized it was rotating with the one light coming around every few seconds that&#39;s what it looked like, I could not see any shape to it but it looked like a small star floating across the sky until it started this rotating and shining of this huge light which I could see going outwards from the object like a flash light being turned on a foggy night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to also make a comment, I believe something is happening and that there is going to be a major event soon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I scanned the skies. I saw in the southern sky, I would say about 3 miles away at a 30-40 degree angle from horizon an orange ball moving slowly across the sky.  I watched it for about 20 sec and I couldn’t make out any blinking lights that indicated it was a plane, so I watched it about 10 more seconds.  At that point I made a decision to go inside and grab my astronomy binoculars to have a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to find the orange ball in the binoculars.  I wanted to make sure I had focused them correctly, so I was adjusting one of the eye pads, keeping the binocs on the object.  The object was glowing orange, but had some red and white in it as well.  As I was adjusting and watching this move across the horizon it faded out and then got brighter, and then it just vanished.  Was not seen in the sky anywhere. It was simply gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What made me pay attention to it in the very beginning was that it was very similar to some red/orange balls I witnessed on July 4th at Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To me it didn’t act like a plane or helicopter.  It was an orange glowing ball slowly making its way across the horizon and it simply blinked and then disappeared.<n>
8/18/10 20:47|Palos Verdes Estates|CA|Changing|10 minutes|3 then 4 lights above Santa Monica Bay, directly aligned above each other, flashing green and red.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77311.html|220|ndxe201008| 3 then 4 lights above Santa Monica Bay, directly aligned above each other, flashing green and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving from the top of the peninsula down to PV drive West, we saw 3 bright lights in the sky on the opposite side of Santa Monica Bay above Malibu.  It seemed odd to us that stars would be aligned so perfectly like that, so we kept watching to see if they were planes, or thought maybe our shifting view would clarify what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our view was obstructed for two minutes, and as we approached Palos Verdes Drive W. (we were on Via Coronel at this point), the lights came in to view again, unchanged.  Our view was obstructed again as we approached the Palos Verdes Drive West, and was blocked by trees as we headed North for around 1/4 mile.  When there was a break in the trees, we pulled over to give it a better look, and again we saw the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were definitely above land, though not extremely high in the sky.  They were as bright or brighter than how Venus usually appears.  We guessed that there was around 1000 ft between each light.  It seemed odd to us that stars would be aligned so perfectly like that, and while we were watching, the middle and upper light started flashing.  The light on top was flashing green and the middle light flashed red.  This continued for approximately one minute, then suddenly a fourth white light zoomed in from the East and into position directly over the green light, and a second or two later the lowest light took off in the opposite direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following that, the red and green lights turned white again.  Then one by one, the three remaining lights appeared to be moving away into the opposite direction of where we were.  First, the uppermost light became fainter and fainter, then the middle light and finally the lowest light remained, becoming fainter, and then disappeared.  The entire event probably lasted 30 minutes, though the initial alignment that we saw may have been like that for awhile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (My cell phone battery was dead, or I would&#39;ve taken video of this!)<n>

He had me stop the car.  When we saw them we got out of the car and we were just staring at them and trying to figure out what they were.  There were two really big like the size of a spot light they were bright yellow/gold lights flickering.  One was on top of the other.  The bottom one was a bit off set from the top one.  They were not moving at at all.  The top light started to slowly fade.  A few seconds later the bottom one faded out too.  The both just faded into the dark sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend is a photographer and I am a legal assistant.<n>

It was a very small object, their was only one, and from what i saw it flowted across the ground, and rose up, straight into the sky. Their was no lights, and the light pole it rose up showed off its grayish black color. It was not a bat, not a bird, or beetle. this object was a oval shaped disc. This object was right infront of my face. This object was not their that long, i looked at it, and in about three seconds it was gone. It didnt jet off, it flowted into the sky, and their was no witnesses, but me, and no cars on the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I watched this object pass through some small light clouds as it floated slowly in a Easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First words out of my mouth were....what the....there&#39;s NO WINGS!!  I repeated this several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was very long compared to its thickness (Long Tube), another thought for describing would be a (Long steal pipe).<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was only one cloud above and to the East that had a high bank that tappered off.  The object slowly entered into the cloud at a slow speed and was covered up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood for a while longer looking all around this cloud waiting for it to exit, as I headed back to my job slowly, and with my eyes on the cloud...absolutely nothing came out of the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have thought of all other possibilities as to what it could have been..... The only things that are most outstanding is that it was very long for its thickness and with no contours to the body.  The other outstanding thing is that it did not have wings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a dark outline around the object, and with a (best description) white/shiny interior, the end were exactly the same (rounded), and there was no glare off the object from the sun in the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cant get this out of my mind....its time I report this!  The clouds were not that high up, a large plane at that height and speed would be too slow for long distance travel, and not to mention the shape would be of a plane clearly!  When I think of the cloud bank and the length of the object, the object could easily have covered at least 3 quarters of the clouds thickness (bank)!  With the sun shining from the West would why would one see a dark outline all around the object?   I really hope someone else in Dryden had seen this that day besides myself!<n>

I continued to look up toward the light  and at approximately 8:55.  at 10 o’clock on the sky a bright oval object appeared from nowhere (the sly was clear blue).  It moved from left to right in the sky for duration of 5 or 6 seconds.  It moved in a straight line parallel to the earth’s surface.  I watched it steadily until it ubruptly disappeared at about 2:30 o’clock.  There were no reflections on my windshield when this occurred.<n>

In the south sky heading east at what seemed to be a pretty good speed was a set of six flashes of light, two sets of three lights that took turns flashing.  The set of lights on the right would flash three times then the set on the left would flash three times.  I saw no physical shape, just those six lights, but they were pretty close together giving the feeling of one craft. i watched it for a little more than fifteen seconds before it disappeared behind some trees.<n>

It is bright like a star, but it flashes like lightning. Mainly it is a white light, but when it moves I have also seen blue.  It flashes like it is taking pictures.  It is not a plane because it movesfrom side to side with such great speed that it leaves streaks of bright light behind. I cannot tell what shape it is because it is too far away.  The lights are illuminating it, but they are so bright.  Whatever it is is staying in the same location for at least an hour for two days in  a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first I thought that it was just a planet like pluto or saturn.  Upon seeing the light zig-zag in the sky, I knew it was something different.  The craft would get very dim and then within a few seconds get as bright as a spot light in the night sky.  I even witnessed it lowering down to tree top level and then shoot back up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To best describe it I would have to say it looked like the shape of an eye with one really bright side that slowly rotated like it was looking for something in the mountains and hills.

A blue/white appeared behind me on my left side comeing from a farm field.  There were no lights on anywhere around me. 50&#39; in front of me 6 bright lights a foot off the ground crossed the road.  The lights were about 18&#34; long 2&#34; high and about 4&#34; apart.  They were stacked three high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other three were 3&#39; behind the first three and it looked like the back three was chaseing the front three.  I would think they were traveling at least 100 m/hr.  The lights went striaght at a house then zig-zagged about 5 times and turned 90%.  They then traveled parallel with the second house and disppeared. I had goose-bumps for 5 minutes. The next day at 14:30 I stoped to look for burned grass but there was none.<n>

The first ufo also had red and blue blinking lights in arrows and x formations they were extremely bright.  All five had similiar features they all came from the same place and went to the same place there were about 10 minute intervals between each ufo.  We are all educated people and I myself DO NOT believe in ufo&#39;s flying inside our atmosphere until now.  We are all 100% they were not man made aircrafts or any sort of plane we all have seen many planes and strange objects fly over here before but have concluded they are planes we could tell once we saw them.  This sighting is completly different we are sure they were ufo&#39;s of extraterristrials.  Please look into this sighting<n>

I went back in and came back out again at around 22:05 and noticed it was moved to almost directly above me after watching it for about 15 minutes I went back in about 2400 I went to check it out again and did not see it so I walked to the side of my apartment and seen it again in the western part of the sky after going back in forth to check it out I started noticing what appears to be aircrafts in the general area about 6 of them on all sides I believe these were aircrafts because I could clearly see blinking colored light (RED &amp; WHITE) with the bright light in the middle of them.  The object appears to be round with like light emitting off it in streams going in different directions.  There are a lot of stars out but nothing as bright as this.

To the south, southwest I could see the moon.  Sitting in a chair facing south I tilted my head back to look at the sky.  I saw a noticeably bright white star, I thought at first it must be a plane... so I watched it for a few and then it suddenly moved very very swiftly in the north direction and stopped very abruptly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second thought was a meteor, after all we did just have a meteor shower this past weekend, but the very bright &#34;star&#34; never disappeared or burned out like a shooting star would have and it stayed in the same spot and just as bright until I mentioned it to friends who were also present at the time.  They shrugged it off and said &#34;satellite&#34; I quickly dismissed this option because of how quickly it moved and stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Don&#39;t satellites stay in continuous motion in orbit around the earth??  Wouldn&#39;t that make them move very slowly across the sky?  And would they be as bright as the moon in blue sky?   I&#39;m not sure if this is the same or similar thing people around the world have seen lately, but it sure does make you wonder.<n>
8/17/10 19:50|Plymouth|IN|Unknown|3 min|Bright blue lights hovering over town|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78454.html|232|ndxe201008| Bright blue lights hovering over town<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was Sunday evening around 7:50 EDT.  I was traveling east on Highway 30 from Valparaiso heading toward Plymouth when about a mile out of town I saw a faint blue light with my peripheral vision low over the sky line .  As I got closer to town, the blue light became more prevalent.  I have my pilot&#39;s license and use to fly so I know that blue lights are not used on planes.  It had an odd flight path which seemed to go straight up, straight down then took a horizontal path over and remained stationary.  As I got into town, I could see not one but two blue lights.  It was hovering low over the Walmart plaza, maybe less than 500 feet.  I was difficult to say the altitude, just that I could the aircraft through the driver&#39;s side seat without having to stick my head out the window to see it.  I literally drove past it on 30, on my left hand side.  I could not see the shape of the aircraft/UFO, just 2 big, very bright and intense blue lights spaced across from o! ne another.  They seemed to be facing downward, shining the lights toward the ground.  I rolled down my window to see if I could hear an engine or rotors but it made no noise.  There is an airport nearby, located on the north east side of town, but it was stationary so that ruled out any airplanes.  Helicopters can be heard a mile away and this was silent, not to mention the strange blue lights on the UFO.  I saw no other lights or markings.  It seemed too big to be some kind of hoax like a model.  I could tell it had some size to it and it was bigger than the Cessna&#39;s I use to fly.  It stayed there for at least a minute or two in duration.  I know I couldn&#39;t have been the only one that saw it; it may know attempt to conceal itself.  You couldn&#39;t miss those bright blue lights!  I continued on my way out of town east on 30 until the aircraft become out of sight.  I&#39;ve read similar sighting that was reported just a week prior in Plymouth, as well as other sightings in Fort Wa! yne and Indianapolis.  Multiple sightings by people in differe! nt towns help validate what I saw and makes me wonder what exactly did I see?<n>

It was very high in the sky and passing under and threw the clouds.  I called the guy who was putting the carriages away and told him to look up at it.  He did and he saw it too.  I said its not a plane or a helicopter or a jet and he agreed.   We both thought maybe it was an airship shaped in a rectangle shape.  It looked like it had windows on one side and the back three quarters was a light blue color with occasional strobe lights on each side.  It glided slowly across the sky and into the clouds.  Later, I looked up Airships on the internet and found out that there are many types of airships nowadays and that some are even shaped like ! sauser ufos and that they now have passenger rides on airships and that companies make personal airships for people customized to whatever shape or design they want.  Also learned that the Army has made one the size of a football field to do spy work over Aphghanistan and saw a picture of another unmanned spy airship that looks like a ufo.  They said they can also operate them remotely.  So whatever it was, it could have been one of these new airships but it definately wasnt a regular air craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I thought it was a promotional thing some local business was doing, but the lights rotated out of there order and the lights, which seemed about 3 to 5 hundred feet in the air were flickering.  Seemed to be a bit of an orange core, but yellow ambient glow.  I was driving at the time, so as I past them I had actually circle around them. So I pulled into a gas station took out my phone, trying to unlock the screen so I could access the camera, I look up and 3 had disappeared and the other three looked in the most peculiar way, floating, but disappearing into the clouds.  The clouds were covering the eastern side of the night sky, which must have been hovering over milwaukee 8-12 miles away.  This was the most awe inspiring thing I had ever seen.  I did not report it though, I want to see how many people report it first so, I don&#39;t feel so mad.  Anyone else?  There was no sound also.  I saw a helicopter flying arou! nd the area too about 20 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/16/10 23:00|Cumberland Island National Seashore|GA|Triangle|15 seconds|Saw large, southbound, silent, black, flying triangle with lights with friend while camping on cumberland island.|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78050.html|241|ndxe201008| Saw large, southbound, silent, black, flying triangle with lights with friend while camping on cumberland island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was camping on Cumberland Island National Seashore overnight with two of my friends, when my friend and I decided to go for a walk on the beach since my other friend went to sleep. The bach was almost  absolutely dark due to the lack of artificial light on the island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were walking along the beach when we noticed a low flying aircraft flying over us. The aircraft was a large black triangular craft with a light fixed on each &#34;point&#34; of the triangle and one in the center. The craft was flying relatively low, made no sound,  and was headed due south towards Jacksonville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself Being a skeptic, I tried to make sense of what we were seeing.  The craft didn&#39;t match any aircraft I had seen (myself being rather familiar with the variety of aircraft  flown around the world). It was flying slowly, giving us ample time to  study it, and when we realized it didn&#39;t look like any known terrestrial aircraft, we were in shock.  About 45 minutes later we saw it again through an opening in the trees,  flying over our campsite, again silent and headed southward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now mind you directly across the westward shore of the island  is the Kingsbay submarine base, and another base is located in Jacksonville.  I know what I  saw was unlike any aircraft openly known, be it terrestrial or not, but it&#39;s always possible that it originated from one of the local military bases.<n>

We were at an intersection Hulmeville and Gibson when we saw a really bright light moving across the sky way in front of us.  We got a green light and started moving towards the direction the light was going; however, it now was coming in our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to have made a complete turnaround in a matter of 25 seconds or less.  It then changed direction again crossing over Hulmeville road.  At this point I still was not convinced until I got away from some of the high trees and saw it had stopped.  It was just sitting in the sky about maybe 800 feet up give or take.  At this point the brighter lights were no longer on just 3 dull lights (white) and one red light which were not blinking.  All the lights though were dull at this point even the red one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I rolled my window down and heard nothing.  I could hear cars, people, and one point even crickets but no sounds that something should make just hovering there in the sky.  It then slowly started to turn and the point or tip of the triangle was pointing downward as it rotated.  Then we had to keep moving and it slowly started crossing the houses over school nearby.  The sighting was about 5 minutes but we turned around about 5 extra minutes to get back to that area and we could not see it anywhere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked and looked and nothing.  I believe it was the same craft design wise that me and my ex saw in December 8th 2002 in Croydon.  I believe that this is probably our spacecraft that are reverse engineered off of Alien spacecraft.  This and the one in 2002 are mostly TR-3B or a variant of it.<n>

We were driving south when when two of us noticed two extremely bright orange-yellow fireball type orbs that were staying static in the air.  Once we noticed the objects we stopped the car and began to closely observe them.  The UFO&#39;s which were two at the time began to slowly rotate around each other as we observed them.  The UFOs were extremely low, barely above the tree line.  The UFOs were from our perspective too our South West. After a few minutes an even more peculiar incident happened.  We observed another orb of extreme luminosity fly by us from the north flying south west.  As our attention was drawn too this third UFO the two orange orbs disappeared.  We proceeded to get in the car and follow the UFO going south down the road. We stopped 1/2 mile down the road and stopped the car to observe this new object.  ITs important to! note that none of the objects exhibited any of the typical characterisicts of a plane of helicopter........when the first UFOs were static and moving there was no audio ambience or sound emitted from them.  This was the same with the third UFO. FLying as low as they were there should of been some type of sound.  All of the UFOs were approximately at a viewing degree of approximately 30 degrees, they were all flying so low that they were barely above the tree line.  The lights were all so bright that it confounded us.  None of us have ever witnessed anything similar to this. And this incident happened with no houses or cars around to emit any source of light.  Also all of the UFOs were strobing throughout the duration of the sighting.<n>

I just happened to look up into the sky in time to see a dark object in the sky flying faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.  It had no lights and made no sound.  It was out of my viewing range in a matter of 5 seconds.  It was flying really low between 1500 and 1800 feet.  But it was too dark to see anything physical about it or any shape.  There is no military base near here and just the shear speed of it just really makes me wonder what I had just seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My aunt&#39;s house sits on a lake line with houses all around the edge of it.  I was just waking up for dinner as my girlfriend was coming in. She stopped and shouted an expletive to which point I jumped up to see what she was looking at. All the way on the other side of the lake above the houses and maybe half a mile behind them (3/4 of a mile from my location), was a light that looked to be the same color as a star but brighter jumping around and basically moving like a bee or a fly all over the sky.  I didn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  We went to grab my dad and went out to the back porch, but it was gone. We watched all night for it again.  There is a lot of air traffic in the area to compare it too and it&#39;s movements and distances traveled were just not humanly possible.  I don&#39;t know what I saw and I&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s an extraterrestrial, but it was definitely unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were waiting for one of my friends to get out of the car. while we were watching him take forever to get out, i noticed a very bright pulsating light in the sky directly lined up with his car just miles in the distance.(i&#39;d say it was over the delta near travis air force base)Due North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of my friends thought it was a planet the other thought it was a star going supernova. i&#39;m well versed in my astronomy and told them that there was no star or planet in that direction (due North), especially none that bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched as it sat completely still, hanging in the sky for about 5 mins when two men got out of their car and were going into the apt. complex; so we stopped them and asked them if they thought that it looked like a helicopter. they said,&#34;hell no! that&#39;s a UfO.&#34; they watched it with us for about one minute and went inside. it was still stationary at this time and still very bright and pulsing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time two of our friends came out of the complex because one was getting a ride and the other was walking her out. As soon as they saw it one of the girls said that&#39;s a UFO, we didnt even tell her what we thought it was. The other girl saw it and ran into the house because she was afraid. The girl got her ride and we still sat watching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then started to dim, then brighten, then go even more dim still. as it did this it moved slightly up, then stopped;slightly left, stopped; and up once more and stopped. The whole time my two other friends were trying to call the people we knew in the apt., but none of there phones were working.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were thinking it was getting bigger for a moment, then i realized it was coming straight toward us. the object moved very slow and was completely silent. when it did reach us, it was 100% lined up with our position, i mean when we looked up it was not to the left or to the right, it was right on top of us! we waited for it to pass a little then ran inside our friends apt. to try and get them to come out to see it. they came out as it was nearly passing the apt. complex&#39;s walls.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it fly into the distance when it suddenly split into to separate lights with a good amount of distance between the two. we watched it until we couldn&#39;t see it any more. The whole experience lasted about 15-16 mins. After the experience was over my two friends that saw it the longest with me, and myself, felt very ill and shaky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After we went back inside we stepped out for a cigarette , this was about five minutes after we went in; we saw a black stealth bomber, running below super sonic, flying in the exact same direction as the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked MUFON&#39;s website the next day to see if anyone reported it. The stealth bomber was sighted slightly more south than my town, which is the direction it was heading, coming from the north. The object was not reported that night, but for the previous night there was a report of an object moving in the exact same pattern,(up,stop,left,stop,up,stop, and then flew right at them) just about 20 miles North of my town.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He had just arrived home and noticed a metallic cigar shape flying above the treeline.  The camera battery was dead but I got our dog and ran down anyway. By the time I got to the parking lot, the object had flown out of sight behind some hills.  We got in the car to drive a bit in the general direction it went and see if we could spot it again, but we couldn&#39;t see due to all the hills in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes later, we headed to our apartment building.  We went to let the dog use the bathroom and that was when I spotted the object, headed back in the same direction it came from.  It looked like a jet with no wings, and it made no sound. I could not see any markings.  It appeared to be rolling like a barrel as it made its way through the sky.  My boyfriend estimated it to be at 1,000 ft. altitude.  He also saw an antenna on the craft which I did not notice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for about a minute until it flew out of sight.  About two years ago we saw an object that was the same shape and also appeared to &#34;roll&#34; or rotate as it flew before in this town, also in broad daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

(would be bright then go out)...then return to its position. the person sitting next to me witnessed the same movement for verification. another coincidental weird factor was the thunder lightening and showers that followed twenty minutes later. the skies were crystal clear ...the storm rolled in ...thundered and lightening ...rained then went away like nothing ever happened. i think the storm might be a coincidence just due to the fact that the entire sighting was so overwhelming? but we saw an orange ball of light. we saw our first Unidentified Flying Object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the next day there was a millitary huey helicopter that flew around for a couple hours as well. again that could have been a coincidence...but i think the nearest military helo pad is about an hour away?<n>

This has caught my attention because the light never went away. At one point the trajectory of the rocket stands still and begins to transform into a small disk and started approaching the city and the area of observation. I left the area of the bridge and sticked close to a building that could give me a possibility of covered area but continued to attend the same approach. However, the subject held his course, and exhibited an additional light that turned towards the bridges. Returned to walk in another direction, for example, approaching the other side and turned his light towards a monument. When the subject has stopped in the area of observation it was almost over my head. While standing on top of the observation zone, its light (which to me seeme! d a kind of probe) directed her toward the area of nightlife  and then went in the direction of the bridge next to the West . Being the nearest point of observation, I note the discoid shape of the object, brown with a more nebulous area in the base bottom center of the disc, giving the idea that this area is moving. The object was low in altitude, no more than 100 meters. The subject did not exhibit any noise or sound. Returning to move slowly forward until the next bridge, also changing its path. Stopped over this (where many people walked) and drove his light / probe towards the main street and monument of the city. Speeding up and leaned for a moment seemed to gain a little altitude and then dive (giving the notion of sudden loss of altitude) towards the northwest on the horizon of observation (almost like land), disappearing. The observation lasted at least a minute. After this, looking for any witnesses, found no one to look to heaven and once I was in a foreign count! ry and in a problematic nightlife área I kepted to myself. One! cellula r photo was taken and I will submit. Sorry the bad english, it was partially translated by Goog.<n>

I was taking pictures when my girlfriend got my attention... at first she thought she saw a police car, but the red and blue lights didn&#39;t flash.  Once the object floated way above any bridge in downtown she knew it was no car.  Thats when she called for me.  I looked at where she was pointing, and instantly knew it was something I had never seen before!  So I pointed my camera and pressed record, but my camera was still set on photo.  So I snapped a quick blurred picture of it before I switched it to video.  I think I got some good footage of the orb floating up, down, and all around until it flickers away into nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still have the raw footage on my camera as evidence to it not being altered with special effects.  I have a simple little digital camera, which would be impossible to add special effects to video on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light seemed to be solid blue on one side and solid red on the other.  You can see this as the object moves from side to side.  During the filming I was so excited, I wanted more footage! I am going back tonight 08/16/2010 hoping to see it again.  I most likely wont, but you never know!   My girlfriend and I feel so special to be able to have seen what we did!  We have always believed that we are not alone in the universe, and now we know!

It was 1994 and Jose Escamilla&#39;s story was big news. While filming parachutists jumping into a deep, vertical cave near San Luis Potosi, Mexico, Mark Lichtle who is a professional cameraman noticed the rods when playing back his film in slow motion. Lichtle saw numerous rods darting in and out of the frame and flying around the base jumpers as they fell through the air.  Articles you may read will say the rods have been found in every country, in different geological areas from swamps to deserts, and I know they are in Idaho.  If you read anything that says they do not exist, just ignore those people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not too long ago a local business caught fire. It was a pallet refurbishing company so the fire was great. We heard the sirens and went out on the porch looking south. Using Google Earth ™, the distance from our house to the wall of smoke was 920 feet. The burning pallets were just to the right (or west) of our line of sight. The wind was blowing due east at about 15 mph. Since it was late evening and dark, the smoke was well lighted from the burning wood. While we watched, something plowed through the burning embers and smoke from the west at a great speed and vanished once it was out of the smoke to the east. The object was traveling fast, but not so fast that we couldn’t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once again, using Google Earth ™ to make angular measurements, determine distances, and where the travel of the object was located, I came up with these facts. The Rod was traveling from west to east at a distance from us of 920 feet. We saw it for three seconds. It was traveling at about 50 mph. My guess is, and it makes sense, the rods travel much faster in the sunlight than in the dark. The Rod was about 10 feet long and was a cylinder at about one foot diameter and with rounded blunt ends. It clearly had three sets of fins. They were not wings but had more the appearance of vibrating fins, one set within a foot of each end and one set in the middle. The Rod appeared from the right side of our view and on the left side of our view the smoke dimmed and was rising more vertically. The Rod was clearly distorting the smoke as it passed through it, and staying level at about 40 feet off the ground. The Rod exited the smoke and vanished. Without the smoke it was entirely invisi! ble. It flew level and with a constant speed. My wife and I spend many nights in our chairs outside looking at the stars. At no time have we ever seen a Rod, but I think now they are there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting location: 43º 43’ 16” N , 116º 42’ 43.5 W or 4.6 miles NNW of Caldwell, ID.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We had just been admiring the clear skies and looking at the  big dipper before we turned a corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom pointed out the first light and I didn&#39;t even look and dismissed it as  an airplane, she said.  Then I looked up and up from the ground somewhere  ahead of us flew amber tinted oval lights.  They look like what a steet light in  the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One after the other they flew up at a 45 degree angles and then  disappeared before our eyes as they went off into the distance.  At one time  one got so close to the other that it looked like it was on top of the other  one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched several fly up into the sky I ran to my parents house and  got my dad who witnessed the last couple fly up.  We counted 9 in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neighbors at the end of the street were also standing in awe and witnessed  the same.   We also ran into a group of boys who had been riding their bikes, who were standing on the sidewalk watching the sky in awe and asked us what  we thought we all had just seen.  It was scary and amazing at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We immediately thought of UFO&#39;s.  After watching them fly off we did see an  airplane in the sky headed another direction.  We knew after seeing the  airplane that what we saw tonight was not an airplane, helicoptor, or  anything else we have ever seen in the sky!<n>

When the pictures were taken the lights did not show up on the display.  The object began moving at a greater speed, so we decided to attempt to follow it in our vehicle.  By this time it was moving so fast we could no longer keep up with it and lost sight of it.  When it disappeared it was travelling northwest, towards Valier, Montana. 4 other people saw it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the photo is of a high-altitude contrail, although the source of the report disagrees.

I called for my brother and his aide to come and look at the strange sky;  I screamed when the lights started to move in a round formation then three lights moved away by themselves and went around in a circle. Then they stopped moving there was complete silence no noise came from them.  Then a jetliner came and they took off in different directions so quickly. I watched one until it looked like a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m calling them lights since that is all that we saw they were so bright but they did not illuminate the ground or the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I have no doubt that someone at any time could tell me matter of fact that &#34;this is a ____&#34;, however I&#39;ve never seen one, and it caught my attention because it was hovering in the air above a field close to Dixon, IL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my way home from Iowa and was on I88 heading east to go back to our west suburban home, when my daughter and I both spotted the black boomerang (kind of) shaped aircraft hovering over a field (at least it appeared to be over a field because it was off in the distance a ways). It was north of the highway, and I wanted to stop but was traveling too fast. I told my daughter &#34;quick!! grab my camera!&#34; She handed it to me and I snapped three photos before it was out of range. (2 of them are rather blurry, as I was in a moving vehicle)  The one thing that was so strange to me is that when I first noticed it, it looked like a flat pencil shape in the sky, but did not appear to be moving forward or backward or up or down.  By the time I took the photos I was closer to it and it appears to have a boomerang-like shape, and a &#34;bubble&#34; type cockpit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one other vehicle that had managed to pull over (I assume for the same reason?) but they were on the other side of the road heading westbound.<n>

It was clear less humidity in the air and sparce fluffy clouds from a little rain we had that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i sat looking up waiting to see what would happen some jets passed overhead and i decided to photograph them figuring i would get those little non-seen UFOs around the jets. I photographed two jets passing and waited. Just them at 10.39.24 i see a silver star appear exactly were i saw the V UFO yesterday. I jumped up with my camera totally pumped and excited aimed the camera and it wouldnt focus, i switched to manual and shot, switched to auto and shot more. The Probe started moving slowly to the east from the west with the direction of the wind, clouds were slowly passing by it. As the probe passed over head i tried to get some video but it would nt work  i started shooting as best i could, i then see a jet coming rite at the Probe and i thought the probe would disapear but i didnt, the people in the jet must have seen the probe as it passed pretty close but both jet and UFO were in a light fuzz hazzy cloud, my camera wouldnt focus, the jet then went by, i shot more, ! then another jet was coming rite at it again and it passed by in another fuzzy cloud, my camera wouldnt focus, if the pilots missed it they shouldnt be pilots i thought. I was alittle frustrated because the jet and UFO would had been great shots. As i shot more photos a jet higher up than the UFO came from the East heading West i snapped great focused shots of the UFO and jet. As the UFO probe headed to the east towards the tree i ripped off as many shots as i could until it went out of sight. In total i got 110 shots as it passed overhead. I then felt it wasnt over so i waited looking around for a few minutes seeing nothing, i grabbed the camera coffee and radio swatting mosquitoes in the miserable zombie heat and headed in the house, i looked over the far trees and over them i saw a flashing object moving west, reminded me of snow goose in flight then i remembered my Chatham sighting of the object that flashed like a snow goose, i quickly sat my coffee and radio down turn! ed as fast as i could to shoot it and it was gone in a split s! econd, i t could have been a Ring-Billed gull, but ill never no cause i missed it!!. In the house processing i picked the best, focused and silver shinny shots of the craft and enlarged and enhanced them. in all the photos there seems to be some sort of plasma dripping out of the craft in every shot. Also in a couple of shots there seems to be a black dot on the bottom of the whatever it is. Awsome! im so pumped up over this sighting. Anyway i only sent the best enhanced enlargments and one normal shot for orientation at 135mm focal lenth, and one with the jet and tree a little larger than normal just to see it all alittle better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Photos not of a genuine UFO, we believe.

There is a hill back of my house 400 ft high and it faces my bedroom directly say another 600 ft away from my house.Mind is the last house down the street.Up this hill there are 2 caves one at the center another at the top of the hill.  The first time i saw the UFO it was flashing  red and white rotating lights at the tip of the hill.  I got so excited i started flashing my flashlight that direction from bedroom window.It moved away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A week later it was back around the same time and i woke up my girlfriend to see this object,it was silent i flashed my light it blinked out.another 2 weeks later at the same spot same time The top cave was lighted up bright white  and the UFO was 50  ft away from the cave tilted at an angle  hovering like its looking into the cave.No lights were shining at that direction  into the cave and yet the cave was lighted up meaning so! me kind of activity is taking place.  The UFO was bigger.and brighter all  5 individual white lights in the UFO  was bright and hovered at that spot,Meanwhile i got excited and i shined my laser light at that direction and went down to my kitchen and opened my kitchen door facing the garage , just then i heard a clicking noise in my right ear (like a dolphin makes),..I did not open my garage door and ignored the noise which went away and returned to my bedroom and it was gone,both lights blinked out including the cave light.I left the country for few months and hope to follow up on my return.We need to respect their presence .People get facinated with UFOs and yet despise the Aliens like some kind of Freaks.Ufos are nothing without the aliens so dont freak out if you are not prepared to accept them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Looked at me like an aircraft flying very fast but when i noticed it for more than 3 seconds, it wasn&#39;t only going in one direction.  It was like, going left, right, going far away and then coming closer, looked like a bulb in the sky playing around. i could only see a light... it was too far off for me to notice if there is any craft. ONLY LIGHTS ... dull bluish white light. Almost like a star...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It kept going left, right, up and down for about 10-15 seconds approx and then it was joined by another 3 lights, all lined up horizontally and they shot up in the sky all of the sudden.  Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wondering maybe its some Military mission or something like that but thought its best to just report it as you are the expert.<n>

Noticed a brightly flashing object in the WSW sky.  Thought it was an airplane because it had several different colors being displayed.  It was the brightest object in the sky except for Jupiter which was to the east area of the sky.  Moon not visible as it had already set.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched I realized the flashing lights did not move in relation to the trees in the yard of the house next door to the south of me.  After 5 minutes (40 miles of jet airliner flight distance) it still remained in the same position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked to where my driveway meets the street some 100 feet west of where I first spotted them to get a better view of the lights.  They were still in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to my house side door and retrieved my 20X80 binoculars to determine if I could see anything with the use of them.  Going back to the driveway entrance I used the binoculars and could see that the lights were changing colors and very quickly.  Red, blue, white, green colors were visible with the glasses but of course the image was all over the place. I placed them on the top of the fence post at the entrance of my driveway and although it steadied the image somewhat it was still only a bouncing globe of lights moving around.  Like trying to watch a star with high power glasses, almost impossible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I watched the lights for about 30 minutes, less the time to get the binoculars, they appeared to remain the same intensity and with multicolors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The position was about where I would expect to see Arcturus, the star the tail of the Big Dipper leads to.  Maybe it was that star, although I have looked at it hundreds of times, including from the flight deck of jet airliners.  I have never noticed it have coloring and flashing brightly like it did tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was about 35 degrees above the horizon and the sky is clear although there could have been some smoke from the forest fires that occur this time of year adding particulates to the atmosphere and perhaps giving a view that I have never seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped watching at 23:45.<n>

I glanced up into the sky and noticed an orange fireball about quarter the size of a full moon, which seemed to be stationary. I speculated that it must have been a military jet with afterburners lit, travelling directly away from me, however it seemed to stay in the one place far too long. It was hard to gauge at what altitude this &#34;fireball&#34; was, other than to say it was below the upper-level cloud. It remained stationary for approximately 30 seconds then suddenly seemed to gain height at an extraordinary rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;fireball&#34; grew dimmer the higher it travelled until it was a faint glow on the upper level cloud. It then headed in an easterly direction out over the ocean. I have no idea what this &#34;fireball&#34; was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was cool for Townsville and the sky was partially cloudy, with some mid-level and high-level cloud.

At the sight of this abnormal object it seemed to be traveling in the same direction we were headed, but to my suprises not as slow as an airplane or helicopter, and at first not as fast as a shooting star.  Yet it seemed to be going at an acceptionally fast speed.  It also didn&#39;t have any sound, in reference to any airplane or jet.  Which a jet would have been a good explanation except the fact that a jet doesn&#39;t fly silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition, this object in the sky didn&#39;t appear to be flying at a high altitude.  In fact it seemed pretty low as if it were a helicopter trying to find someone or something.  At first it was just a stream of light then it came lower then it was, not by much but still a little lower.  Then it suddenly picked up speed and the aluminescence grew into a stream of light trailing a ball of light.  Then it seemed to reach a higher area in the sky and at this moment it changed colors immediately from white, to red, then instantly blue and within a fraction of a second it was gone.  It almost seemed to have maybe gone behind a thick cloud, due to the weather we&#39;ve been having.  Then my mother and I realized, there wasn&#39;t any clouds in the immediate area of the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ultimately, the sight was both shocking and surprising, given it all occured within the most two seconds, or less.  I confidentally believe what I witnessed wasn&#39;t anything in our United States technological capabilities, unless it was an SR-71 Blackbird in central Floridas air space.  It&#39;s one of the only flying objects to my knowledge that would fly close to the speed, without sound, and disappear from sight instantaniously with little conflict, compared to what I witnessed.  Besides the SR-71 doesn&#39;t hit an immediate &#34;warp speed&#34; and aluminate in red then blue and disappear.  I know it sounds tampered with but the object had a blunt oval shape to my sight, possibly due to the engle of visual but to my knowledge it was practicaly oval.<n>

My Dad actually thought it might be a plane on fire at first and called 911 in Genesee County to report it.  We were told by the dispatcher that we perhaps saw Meteors from the Pegasis Meteor showers that were going on.  We have been watching them and know the duration of a meteor or shooting star is usually seconds.  We actually saw it a second time but further away and lower on the horizon.  The direction of travel was NNE from the Big Dipper towards Cassiopia however it was actually below Cassiopia constellation.  When  it disappeared it looked like a star however when it was overhead, two of the persons smelled a burning smell in the air.  The other two did not.The 911 Center did call us back and stated that Bishop International Airport did not have any reports of aircraft in trouble.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Elevation: 970 feet.  The location of the incident Warren, New Hampshire, in White Mountains national forest near Mooshillaukee Mountain, off route 118.  We were facing in a North West direction sitting at a campfire with low flame as we were at the end of our time outdoors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Calmly we were discussing and chatting, when my mother asked me, &#34;What is that?&#34;  I got up and went toward the fireplace to look around the canopy opening.  I then saw a glowing orb shape the size was a quarter of the size of the moon.  The color was gold orange and the object was slowly crossing the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went through possibilities in my mind of what it could be.  It was not a planet as it moved. It was not a coloring changing star. It did not move in the fashion of an airplane.  It did pause in flight. There was no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went onto the deck of our trailer to follow its flight path.  The object was pulsating in intensity and brightness.  The object remained in the same spot for about a minute.  Then we lost sight of the object behind foliage.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went toward my mother’s vehicle which was parked toward the south to see if the object to could be seen at a father distance or if changing height would allow better viewing.  We went back onto the deck of our trailer from the car area while looking for the object to see where it had gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw the object change direction and it increased in size coming toward us.  The object’s size doubled and the light intensified no longer pulsating as it appeared to be coming closer to us.  We then went into the trailer to avoid confrontation and started to use the phone and internet.  No interruption of any technology was evident.<n>

On the 8th.of August 2010 I looked out of my window and saw in the sky, a light, travelling in a SE. to NW. direction.  I went outside and looked up at the light, it was red to orange in colour and in a figure of eight configuration with the two balls of the eight off set.  I watched this light and when it was almost directly overhead it slowed, stopped, then faded into two little white dots, and disappeared.  I realised that what looked like a single figure of eight shaped light was actually two separate round red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 14th.of Aug, my wife and I saw a red ball of light come over the Campsie Fells (which are 10 miles distant to the north) and fly towards us in a N. to S. direction.  When at a distance of approximately one quarter of a mile to our left it slowed, stopped, then disappeared.  About 30 seconds later another red light appeared over the Campsie Fells and travelled towards us, it slowed then stopped at exactly the same spot as did the first. This went on at very regular intervals for some time, red lights travelling towards us, stopping and then disappearing. Although I didn&#39;t time them, the lights took about one and a half minutes to travel the 10miles from the Campsie Fells.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night I looked over towards the Kilsyth Hills which are really a continuation of the Campsie fells and saw a red light, then another come over these hills and disappear at some distance from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no way these lights could be Chinese lanterns.  They travelled at speed in the same trajectory, stopped, then disappeared in exactly the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 17th.of August we saw two more red lights travelling in a NW. to SE. direction then disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then, we realized the brightest and closest star had a red light and moved about ,left right top down.  It dawned on us that this was a UFO and on close scrutiny, we saw and counted 4 other stars that had blinking red lights.  They were not planes flying towards our Changi airport !   The UFOs then moved far away and could hardly be seen by the time we left close to midnight .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I am going to report exactly as she told me. The craft was triangular with rounded tips.  The color was a pale gray.  The edge of the ship made it out to be slightly rounded in the middle.  She estimates the distance would be up higher than any conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights had a strobe pattern blink flash repeat. Light Colors were in a row through the middle of the ship.  The colors were 3-5 repetitions of green, yellow and pinkish purple.

In a matter of about six to seven seconds it moved in a circular motion.. twice, then zipped off into the dark sky.  It appeared to be about four miled away from us to the North.  We were facing North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My third friend came out to the backyard as we were discussing this.  This is when the object appeared again.. for about 8-9 seconds this time.  The very same object.  This time, it made two circles again, hovered in place for about 3 seconds, then again flashed off into the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it was gone and did not reappear.<n>

I have worked in aviation for over 20 years and have seen a lot of aircraft so I asked them if they wanted to see something interesting. As we walked outside we noticed two more behind these, then two more seemingly flying in pairs but fairly evenly spaced overall. The moon was partially obscured in the western sky but there were few clouds and the winds were calm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The string of lights were yellowish-orange in colour, somewhat like the sodium street lamps in our neighbourhood. They were slowly pulsing and as they travelled at what would appear to be aircraft takeoff and climb speeds (200-300 knots), they turned to a more northerly course and faded out. There were no visible beacons or other lights on the objects (what caught my attention in the first place).  I ran inside to get my phone to see if it could record the event on video, but the quality was too poor to detect the lights and only recorded our commentary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came back outside we watched in amazement as the count increased to eight, then ten and finally twelve with about six visible at any one time (the others had turned north and faded out in sequence).  We noticed that they appeared to be climbing from the Georgetown area to the west and did not all follow the exact same course, some turning north before others did.  I observed one passing behind a cloud and then emerging again just before fading out completely and none of them ever stopped pulsing, they just appeared to dim as they got farther away.  I thought they must be helicopters to have maintained their formation so I asked my daughter to run in and shut off the air conditioning but there was no detectable sound so they may have been too far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see no other aircraft in the immediate airspace, but saw one to the south heading north (presumably from Pearson International Airport) that may have observed them.  After the last light faded away, an aircraft flew overhead with the familiar beacons of a passenger jet and it was obvious to all of us that these lights in the sky appeared to be something different.<n>

Each moving star (3-4 inches apart from one another by hand measurement) slowly disappeared one at a time. It appeared that each of the 3 star-like objects were moving together in the same exact direction and were paralleling each other on their route. We thought it could have been 3 satellites moving together but very strange they were in a triangle formation and moving at relatively the same velocity.  They disappeared at different times, (disappearing 3-5sec. apart from one another).  Just thought someone should know.<n>

It was getting later in the evening, but it wasn&#39;t yet completely dark.  I noticed a bright orange light coming from behind a neighbor&#39;s house.  From what I could see, it looked like it was in a round shape, but had something that branched off the side of it, only one side.  Definitely not an airplane wing.  It was moving probably a bit slower than what an airplane would be and my sister and I watched as it veered off to the left (from our view) headed for a big, thick cloud, as it was cloudy that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t until the second one came from the exact same place in the exact position that we went in to get our mom. We were kind of freaked out by it, but weren&#39;t sure exactly what we were seeing. By the time the three of us returned outside, the first one had gone into the cloud and the second one was headed in the same direction.  We waited to see if the first one would come back out of the cloud from a different direction, but it never did and eventually, the second one did the same thing.  Then we saw a third one.  It moved just as the first two had and disappeared within the cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood outside for quite a few minutes watching and waiting, but nothing ever reappeared and no more were seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFOs?

They appeared one after another for about 8 minutes, with two or three following about 10 minutes after that. The first couple appeared to be going as fast as helicopters, but flying at the apparent same height as airplanes. They also appeared to fade out once they reached a certain point, though we couldn’t tell if they were just going behind clouds or actually fading away.  They had no tail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It stopped occasionally and &#34;rocked back and forth&#34; before proceeding in the same direction.  She tried to film it but her cell phone video camera (mysteriously) wouldn&#39;t work.  It finally went behind the hill by Griffith Park and did not come back into view.  She is sure it was not a blimp, plane or helicopter because of the rocking motion it made, and because it was clearly saucer shaped, like two equal sized saucers stuck together.  It should also be noted that she is a Christian and previously a staunch non-believer in extra-terrestrial life.  She was so excited, she called me and I got on the roof of our house in Burbank but could see nothing.  However, I did see a helicopter over the hills, which may have been sent to investigate.  She then picked me up and we drove ! back to the canyon lookout point where she saw it.  However, we saw nothing in the sky after looking for 20-30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I looked at the edge of the thundercloud, I saw a completely black object at least 20,000 ft. up in the atmosphere. The object was so high up that I couldn&#39;t make out any details, only could I make out very general details.  The object moved slowly and smoothly and no engine sound was emitted, of course it was so high up. Although the object was to small to be an airliner, and it was way of course the usual plane route. My house happens to be under a MAJOR plane route and every single day at least 150 planes fly above my house, so I&#39;m quite familiar with planes because I see them so often. I strongly believe that the object WASN&#39;T a bird, because I really doubt they fly so high up, we do have a lot of birds in Puerto Rico anyways! Well before I could get someone to see it for th! emselves or a camera at least, the object dissappeared behind a cloud. What interests me is that the flying object was flying over a highly restricted air zone, here in Ft. Buchanan, only military helicopters and commercial airliners are allowed to fly over the base.  I&#39;d really like that government officials have a better eye out on the sky around here, who knows if the object was a threat?  If it was human, it could have dropped a bomb, don&#39;t you agree?  But I highly doubt it was human anyway, it was moving in a way so smooth, that no other plane I&#39;ve seen has ever flown so gracefully.<n>

It was the size of a very large dog around 90 pounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Aug 14 2010 (about two weeks later) a black helicopter is looking for something just feet above our house. It stays there and nearby for about 20 minutes. About 2 hours later it came back and did the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That Saturday night we heard a pitiful cry sounding like fear and despair.

It seems to be three painted shapes of the aliens, according to the television show, and they have three heads seems like they are walking all together and the heads are all in a line in straight row and the bodies seem like they are floating on a cloud or showing something that floating, and the three bodies are directly above the scratching of(alot of paint) showing of something floating. The bodies are thin and and seem like they are all walking. There are no arms just a dot and straight long line the part attached to the head is one straight line and the last two lines are the legs spread apart as if they are walking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just thought it seems funny and this picture is painted on the parking lot of all silver paint (alien paint maybe or of some chemical.  It&#39;s not real messy, but it is big enough that peo! ple were scare to park their cars there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The the direction of the picture had to come from directly above my apartment.  The three aliens had to have landed on the roof top and make this picture.  The picture is pointed directly towards my window.  The silver paint is nothing like I&#39;ve seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t think it can be removed.  I think it has to be completely painted over or dug up to remove the object shape on the ground.  The whole complex has to of seen this object or painting in the driveway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The channel that I seen this television show is the history channel about the aliens. I believe this is an contact from the other side. When I took the pictures, I feel really funny after I took the picture.  Thanks for letting me report this.<n>

It was brighter then any star we have ever seen, which is what originally brought our attention to it.  After a while, it significantely dimmed in brightness, almost to the point of disappearing.  We then got our video camera out and although we couldn&#39;t see anything through the camera, when we later viewed the digital image we discovered alot of anomolies.  It moved very fast in multiple directions.  At one point during or filming, we noticed an orange light that zipped all over the area in no appearant pattern.  It left a trail behind it as it zipped through the sky, right up until the point where it completely disappeared.<n>

They were silent and holding still. They were placed one directly above the other and very close to each other. They were brighter than anything I have ever seen. I would estimate that they appeared to be some thousand times larger than Venus as she rises.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I glanced away for a mere second to check what my dog was doing. I then looked back to where the fireballs were but they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired, educated person, and the author of one of the history books about Kennewick.

Then the small light was gone but the other light was still doing the same thing.  My brother turned the light on from our house and then the light would get dim and as soon as we turned the light off it would be bright.  Dont know how long it was because I got tired and went to bed.<n>

Three other similar objects were found in the same direction but not close to each other.  The movement of the objects is not predictable or regular.  This is the second night that we have seen objects like this.   Sometimes it seems to zoom very quickly up and down and around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called someone in Houston and they reported seeing the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Not very big, maybe as big as a swimming pool.  Had 3 lights, I think, which were fading in and out.  I had seen a massive shooting star fall towards the ground barely 2 minutes before.  The lights were whitish-blue and not like bright and starry shaped like lights in the sky can be but softer and blurrier.  It was moving too slowly to be anything else, and it was so close to the ground, I think the depth perception was hard. Nothing on the ufo was moving, it was just simply gliding across the air.  Then I turned left onto shea blvd and it was gone.<n>

We saw a few shooting stars and watched a couple of satellites go by and the both of us spotted this floating ball thing in the sky at exactly the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We looked at it and realized there a ton more surrounding it. There had to have been at least 15 of these ball shaped lights all gathered in a crescent shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were brown in color and there was no noise to be heard, so they weren&#39;t birds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t a plane or a helicopter either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It remained at a constant speed and it lasted for about 25 seconds.<n>
8/13/10 23:40|Milton|NH|Triangle|30 min|Black Triangle/Pyramid shape craft flew across lake and directly over our car|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77235.html|310|ndxe201008| Black Triangle/Pyramid shape craft flew across lake and directly over our car<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Aug 12, 2010, I went out about 2:30 am to watch the Perseids meteor shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was by Milton 3 Ponds in Milton, NH, I was looking at the bottom Right star in the little dipper, when I saw a extremely bright flash at first I thought I saw a star burn out, when my eyes  adjusted I noticed that the star was still there but now it was moving from left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My next thought was well it is just a satellite or maybe the space station, just then it stopped, It stayed stationary for about 5-6 seconds and then it started moving again but in a different direction, it now was heading toward the lake it made a large ark out and around the lake and right back to the place where I first spotted it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night Aug 13, 2010, my neighbor that I told what I had seen the night before ask me If I would go back to the lake and take him this time, and I did, well we were not there 10 minutes when the same object appeared again roughly in the same spot I had seen it the night before. About 5-6 minutes later my friend pointed out a really bright light in the western sky just above the tree line, we watched this bright light for a good half an hour, during this time we watched this light change from red to green to blue and also white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light also would appear to just blink out completely for 3-4 seconds and then appear again but several feet in the sky to its left and our right, it also looked like it was moving up and down left and right and even at times in small circles this light disappeared 5 times 4 of the 5 it would re-appear but each time it came back it was a little more to its left, the 5th time it went out it did not come back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had no clue what we were looking at and jokingly I said to my friend what would you do if it disappeared and all of a sudden it was right above us, as I finished saying that I kind of jumped and said holly shit that just scared the shit out of me, my friend quickly looked in my direction and said what?, and I replied oh that plane coming across the lake with its landing lights on, we kind of laughed but kept watching the plane, as it got closer it started looking more and more not like a plane,  My friend asked is there an airport close by and I said no why?  And he said then why would it be so low and have its landing lights on?  Well this got us both really watching these 2 lights that I thought at first was a plane with its landing lights on, it was getting closer and we still didn`t hear any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer we could see it better it had 2 large flood lights in the front but we didn`t see the standard red and green blinking lights on the wings, and still didn`t hear any sound from it we were sitting in the car with the sunroof open, and the craft was coming right at us from my left across the lake. It flew just about right over us, as it got right above us it was about 3-400 feet up and it flew through a small cloud as it got right above us that was when we heard a very low like rumbling sound nothing like a plane at all, but when it entered the cloud those huge spot lights in the front lit up the whole cloud and it illuminated the whole craft in like a golden aura, that was when the 2 of us really got a good look at it and I can say it scared the hell out of us both!! It looked like a large triangle, the first thing my friend said was holy shit look at that it looks like a pyramid flying over us!! It had the 2 large lights in the front and one large strobe in t! he back there were no other standard lights at all on this thing! what I saw was what looked like a pyramid sitting on top of this black triangle I also saw well the only way I can describe it as a half of an arch going from half way from the rear point of the triangle from the front arching up to this pyramid shape that was on top of the triangle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the inside of this arch looking part on the pyramid part it looked like either a row of six windows that were illuminated from inside with a golden light or maybe it was just a row of 6 golden lights. It wasn`t moving very fast at all, maybe like 40-50 MPH because we got a good look, as it went over us for I would say maybe 4-5 seconds. On the right side of the road, is a row of pine trees as it went over these trees, I jumped out of the car and ran to the other side of the road just past the row of trees is a swampy area roughly a quarter of a mile across then you hit the rest of the woods.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked to us like it had dropped even lower when it passed the first row of trees to where I thought it was either going to land or crash into this swampy area, but when I got to the tree line I could see this thing start to move back up and over the wooded area on the other side of the swamp, and it  seemed to just blink out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this in my life, and I have seen a lot of different aircraft, I am a Navy vet that served during the Gulf war.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been trying to draw what I saw but I am not a very good artist, after we got back in the car I realized my new cell phone had a camera and does take video I am really kicking myself in the butt for not thinking of using the phone to either video it or at least get a few snap shots of this thing!<n>

We cannot take a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time, I drove back to hotel. I am not sure what city is, but I drove from Yosemite to La quinta hotel in Ripon city.  I used GPS to go there.  The object has a orange light on the bottom. My friend and I saw 4 circle lights.  The object is similar to half circle with a light on the bottom. \<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped a car and looked back to the object but we could see it because it was in behind the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure how to explain.  I saw during a turn.  You can imagine the highway on the mountain.  It has a lot turn.  I am sure it is not an airplane.  I am very excited.<n>

or &#39;between&#39; the segments, althogh if i had, i would have noticed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> at this point the crescent moon had set, i suspect that this object was high enough to gather ambient light enough from the same source as our satellites (the sun), and reflect it back. it could have been picking up the glow of the moon below the horizon, or ambient city light glow.   the sight of it also gave me the impression that somehow it was absorbing most of the light, like it was cloaked.  my only other thought on what this was like would be an airplane flying with no lights at all.  it still does not explain the shape of the object, or the apparent formation change during flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> there was no sound, no smell, no vibrations, no strange feelings during this sighting.  i live approximately 6 minutes by commercial air travel from newark airport (25 miles or so by car) and wonder if anything showed on radar (if this thing was low enough).   becouse i am an experienced sky observer, i believe that this is indeed a ufo, unless there are man made crafts that can appear as i have described.  when i first saw this object, i remembered to be as observant as possible and kept in mind real life comparisons for a good description. i have searched the internet for descriptions or videos that are similar.  when i find something i will be in touch.  i am only sorry i did not have my hd camcorder ready, although i am not sure this would have shown up in video without more hi-tech equipment.  i get annoyed at some of the ufo reports that lack in detail, or have poor descriptions. and i want to be as detailed as possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> to demonstrated my observational skills and knowlege: previously, i have seen many things that seemed unexplainable in the night sky.  i came to no conclusions until i thought through what i had seen.  there was a reasonble explanation, no matter how fantastic it seemed at the time.   two of these previous sightings are as follows:  one object i had seen was a very bright round falling object in the southeastern sky in mid october. a peice of it had also fallen away below it like molten silver, i watched it fade after about 5 minutes. it made no noise although it looked like it would hiss like a fire if you could hear it.   it was either a shooting star coming directly at me that broke up into two peices, or a rocket booster falling away after lauch. this occured around 3 am and i was too tired to look it up, but i am sure that is what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> the other object was a very distant, large bright green flair in a cold winter northeastern sky, a green so brilliant, like the the color green a diamond reflects in the sunlight.  this flair left a trail and it traveled in horizontal fashion, taking much longer than fireworks to fade. there was no sound. this was probably a military flare from a marine vessel (i live close to the waters west of new york city and staten island--close enough to observe a flare from the water there if it was shot high enough).<n> <n><n> <n><n> the exact dates of these occurences have long been forgotten, because i knew they were easily explained.  at the time, they were surprising and amazing to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i am an expereinced amateur sky watcher.  i would like to point out that i know the difference between the most obscure explanaions for identifiable objects, and an unidentified flying object.  i have seen almost every kind of non-ufo expample in the day and night sky -- so i do know the difference.  i hope there is some logical explanation for this.  i have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ok for preliminary email contact by nuforc investigator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> thanks.<n>

The objects were triangular in shape, vertical with the apex pointing straight up. Inside the triangles were undulating white, green and red lights that morphed around inside the triangles like colored bubbles inside a lava lamp.  Each triangle was about the size of a dime at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Initially the triangles passed from the south toward the north in a somewhat horizontal path and stopped due east about 45 degrees above the horizon.  At the same time I saw an airplane pass in front of the triangles and then I saw a satellite pass over them. They were bigger than the jet airliner so they must have been at least 100 feet on a side. The objects were distinctly different from either the airliner or the satellite. The objects were about as high as the plane and beyond it a ways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once the triangles stopped, they slowly moved around in the sky, up, down and sideways with no particular pattern to their movements.  At times they hovered nearly still in their positions and then they would resume their dance.  The objects were never touching and did not remain adjacent to one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually they started moving directly upward.  The triangle on the right stayed in position lower than the one on the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched the objects ascend, a deer entered my yard and startled me.  When I looked back, I could no longer see them.<n>

At first we thought it might be a satellite but it was moving much faster than other satellites we had seen.  We live in a wooded mountain area with no ambient light to obstruct the sky.  The object appeared to be round but was too far to be certain.  Suddenly the object stopped and emitted a bright light blueish/white in color for about 10 seconds.  After the bright light went out the object continued quickly moving north and disappeared from our line of sight<n>
8/13/10 21:30|Eagle Lake|ME|Circle|20 minutes|Cirular craft that had lights making a full circle, and large dome light in center.|12/20/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95319.html|318|ndxe201008| Cirular craft that had lights making a full circle, and large dome light in center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is just info as to where we were and why we were there at the time of sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late on Friday the 13th in august about 21:30 eastern time, my girlfriend her friend and myself went up the road to use a cell phone to make a long distance call.  I live in a very northern area so there is no cell service where I live, so we went to the top of the road in my car to get service about 2 miles north of my house.  My girlfriend’s friend was calling her boyfriend who was on his way up from downstate, as the phone was ringing I heard a very loud sound coming from outside of my car.  I asked my girlfriend “do you hear that” and she said “yea it sounds like a jet”, I said” there’s no way thats a jet it’s way too loud”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of the car because this sound was so loud that if it was a jet, it would have been landing right near us the sound was thunderous.  When I stepped out of the car, I looked up and coming directly over us was a craft with lights going all the way around making a full circle. The lights on it were yellowish white red and green alternating around the whole craft, and at the back of the craft (based on the direction of travel I assumed it was the back) it was slightly flat across the back.  It also had a light in the center of the craft there was a dome light that was yellowish white like a low wattage conventional light bulb.  I was so shocked I started yelling at the other two passengers in the car “ get out of the f@#$ing car you guys got to see this?&#34;  I yelled that until they were out of the car and they got out and saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was coming from a southwestern direction and moving towards the northeast, it moved at a fairly slow rate and must not have been more than 500-1000 feet high (made this estimate based on how large the object appeared to be) when it was directly above my car it had to be about three times wider than my car.  We watched the craft continue on a northwestern coarse it tok about five minates before it was pretty far away and the lights were getting smaller.  I noticed that the shape of the craft changed like it was leaning sideways, it started to turn around made a very wide turn and came back towards us.  When it got back closer to us it headed to the southwest towards the lake behind my house, we drove down the road to follow the object and ended up stopping at the boat landing.  We could see it for about another five minutes and continued past the lake directly towards Mt. Katahdin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lost sight of it the whole sighting must have been 20-25 minutes, after the craft was no longer in sight we stayed there for a few minutes.  After we lost visual sight of it we started to see many planes in the sky(could tel they were planes because of FAA lights) after 5-10 minutes of losing visual of the craft there were numerous planes in the sky.  There were so many planes going back and forth like they were going in a grid pattern at one point we all tried to count the planes and could count 15 in our sight at one time.  This went on for about a half hour, before we left and it seemed clear to me that these planes were looking for something. (very unusual to see more than two planes in the sky above this very rural area) I watch the sky’s very often out here because I have seen strange objects in the sky few times before, one time a craft came over our house that looked similar and resulted in a total power loss of our neighborhood once the object was far power came ba! ck on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting for us was crystal clear, the object was very low and the lights showed the shape of the craft it was a circle with a flat back, it had a decently large yellowish dome light right in the center of the craft, and the smaller lights going all the way around the craft yellowish red and green in that order alternating.  We are certain as to what we saw my girlfriend still describes it in the same way over two years later.  The sighting was so spectacular that if I were alone by now I would have doubted what I saw if I didn’t have someone to confirm what we saw.  Since that sighting I have seen a couple other unidentifiable objects, but none as low or close as this particular one.<n>

The lights were dim with yellowish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was at least one or two miles above earth and slowly coasting across the sky without any sound.  It was heading SE from Cave Creek and Union Hills and appeared to have crossed highway 51.<n>

It was about 150 feet off the ground and was about 5 or 6 feet in size.  It had a white hue to it with what looked to be a glowing fire orange/red center.  The object hovered in one spot for about 5 seconds and then followed myself and a friend back towards our house as we called for the third witness to come outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As he came outside the object shifted direction and headed towards the East. It traveled at a fast speed and did not make a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few seconds of the three of us looking at it, it disappeared.<n>

Both was a amber color similar to a candle light. the triangular one was on top towards the right of the oval.  they both hovered and it seemed like to be about maybe 5-10 miles away from where i was standing. first it both held its position for about 30 seconds then the triangular shape ufo started to diminish, it wasn&#39;t fast but very slow forming a second oval shape. that took about 20 secs, then the same triangular ufo that turned into a oval gotten smaller but didnt seem to more farther in distance.  it became a little spec of light and disappeared. keep in mind the lower oval shaped one was still there this whole time. ok it now gets better. then the oval shape one still hovered at the same position for about 3-5 minutes. then a light started to appear to the bottom left of the oval! shape and started to form a oval i think it was the second craft coming back. by then i was so amazed and a little freaked out. they both hovered for another 2-3 mins not moving or anything. then the lower left one started to fade. then the single oval shaped craft that never moved stood there another 2 mins then faded. that whole sighting lasted about 10 mins. it never changed color, just shape. i didnt hear any noise at all.. keep in mind the direction that i was looking at was towards McConnell air force, Cessna aircraft, and boeing. so it could have been a experimental plane but i know for sure a plane when i see one because i used to work in the aircraft industry. i truly believe i seen a UFO. i didnt have my phone on my at the time so i couldnt take any pictures.<n>

8/13/10 04:52|Oak Lawn|IL|Light|2 minutes|Fast Moving Dim light Filmed going Past Bright Star|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77228.html|323|ndxe201008| Fast Moving Dim light Filmed going Past Bright Star<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was trying to see if I can see a Meator Shower and saw an dim light object coming at a fast speed 900 miles per hour. I pulled my Cellphone Camera out that was seeing to get a little light in background so it would show up on camera and luckilty it was past the the brightest star in the sky.  As I was unzooming my camera from the setting I had it on when the cellphone camera was in my hands I was using a Sony Ericsson C905a Cellphone Camera.  As I was filming it went past I said Here comes a Fast one.  Than I said It&#39;s coming faster this time. Than I said as I was unzooming I said Right Past this Star. Than I said It&#39;s going right past this star Right now. Than I said shouting there it is I got it on Camera.  Than said I got it. Than I said I got you on Camera boy.  Than I said hows it going dude. Than I said Yeah. Than I said in a studdering voice it got to be a UFO.  Than I said this is not than shockingly said ohhh a Meatorite just fell down that i wish I wou! ld of got that on camera. After that the camera shuts off after 47 seconds. I caught 27 seconds on film. The 20 seconds was me getting the camera out of zoom and waiting for it to come towards a better light source that big star in the sky. There was a some what alot of shacking in the camera footage while filming. The object was half the size of the star. The Star was 85 percent brighter than the object that was moving fast. The footage was taped at 4:52 AM. Footage is hard to see it but i have good contact lenses and can see good clearly. The Bad News is when I try to send this footage named MOV00025 to my email like I do with all my videos it says when I try to send the Cellphone is reading (Cannot add Video. Message will be to Large.) File Size is only 1.4MB and that should be able to send from my Cellphone to my Email.  The video is stored in my Phone Memory as MP4 just like all my other camera footage. Why is this too large when at 5 Am I am filming another one or the ! same one that is 2.7 MB and that one will send but not worth s! ending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Why is 1.4MB to large to send and 2.7MB is ok to send from Camera phone that don&#39;t make sense I think what I was filming sent me a Virus?  I have a AVS Editor I wanted to use to edit the cellphone camera footage file so I can gett a better view on my Windows XP Computer. The transfer file area does not work with the USB 2.0 plug my Cellphone came with the software for transfer says for windows XP says can&#39;t be added to this computer when uploaded the software my cellphone came with. Sending to Video DJ on Cellphone don&#39;t work  Either. Next try to send it to a memory Card once I order one if that will work.  Well anyways the ufo made no sound and over my head in a 360 direction past the sun over parents house as I was on the front sidewalk and saw it for almost 2 minutes until it was too far to see.  Than at 5 oclock it might of been back again it was about 6 blocks away coming back in the background in my back yard. I was flash the camera light at it trying to communicate with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>
8/13/10 04:30|Hot Springs|VA|Changing|Several Minutes|Low flying lights manouvering over treeline.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77174.html|324|ndxe201008| Low flying lights manouvering over treeline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went out to the lookout point east of runway 7 at Ingalls Field abandoned airport to watch the Perseid Meteor Shower at about midnight with a group of 6 people.  We saw several bright shooting stars before a brief rainshower passed through and everyone bugged out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Took everyone home, and by the time everyone was home, it had cleared up again, so I decided to drive back up the mountain to see the peak by myself.  I arrived at about 3:30 AM, parked and set out in my chair behind my car with all lights off... about one or two per minute for at least an hour! Ink black sky, Milky way easily visible with the naked eye.  It was beautiful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I noticed something flashing through the trees to the east. It was a VERY brigh pure white light flashing so brightly it could be seen through the treeline, very low.  I waited for it to pass from behind the trees, and it raised in altitude and changed from a single white light brighter than any star in the sky to a row of 2-3 ! orange lights in a line, which seemed to pulsate or move left to right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What scared me was the maneuverability.  This thing was flying &#34;S&#34; shaped patterns up and down over the treeline, estimated max altitude 2000 ft., apparent size as big as a pinky fingernail width at arms length.  It started flying in the same direction as the road I drove up to get to the lookout, and I got scared, so I instantly popped my trunk, folded my chair and threw it in as fast as aI could and hit the &#34;unlock&#34; button on my car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as the car unlocked, all the car lights went on, and I thought &#34;SH*T&#34;!  I looked up, and the three orange lights became one much brighter orange light, almost looked like it was shining something at me, like it saw me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I instantly hopped in my car, cranked it and tried to run in a panic... the car cranked very very slowly for a few seconds, and the lights dimmed before it started up and I drove away. I was scared because I had to drive in the direction of the thing to get out of there so I floored it very fast, narrowly missing a deer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked up, and at one second could see the thing through my winshield, which scared me even more. I didn;t feel safe until the road went under the dense tree canopy. There was no noise at all, and no contrails.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I can say is, never again by myself.  Been up there several times to look at stars with people, and we often see solid lights at high altitude on ballistic trajectories, probably satellites, but this was low and bright, and abnormal.  Don;t know what it was, but never again by myself at that hour..<n>
8/13/10 03:33|Temecula|CA|Unknown|10 - 15 seconds|High altitude light that faded into two small points of light, slowly moving in tandem to the south.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77175.html|325|ndxe201008| High altitude light that faded into two small points of light, slowly moving in tandem to the south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was up late watching the Perceids meteor shower with my main view towards the North East.  It was a beautiful, clear night with no moon.  Jupiter was hanging high over head and slightly to the south at this hour.  There were several nice meteors, two brilliant ones of note, but the rest were just tiny little streaks.  I was getting a little bit bored with looking at the same section of sky so I looked back over towards the South.  I could see Jupiter shining through the fabric of the sunshade but off to the side of the shade and directly overhead, I noticed a bright, smaller, pale, bluish, white light.  I was confused since I knew it wasn&#39;t another planet and I hadn&#39;t remembered seeing a star that was that bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As pondered this anomaly, it just slowly faded out.  While my eyes adjusted tracking around it&#39;s position, I then got this bizarre motion sensation which really bugged me out since I was sitting stationary.  I realized then that it wasn&#39;t me that! was moving, it was a tiny light that my eye had fixed upon, it was no brighter than the background stars, and it was moving slowly towards the South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That&#39;s when I noticed it wasn&#39;t alone.  There were two distinct, small points of light moving perfectly in unison together with one ahead of the other at a slight angle from my perspective, there was a decent gap between the two, about an inch and a half to two inches if you measured between two fingers of an outstretched hand.   A jet flying at a high altitude with it&#39;s standard running lights flashing also happened to fly overhead a moment later, but towards the East at a completely perpendicular angle to the lights.  I don&#39;t think the jet&#39;s appearance was related, as I could tell it (the jet) was much, much closer that the lights.  What ever I was seeing had to be at an extremely high altitude, possibly in orbit or possibly in outer space.  I honestly don&#39;t know what I saw tonight but it just gave me the chills.  I thought, maybe it was two objects at first, but then I wondered, what! if it w as just one, extremely long object that was dimly illuminated at either end?  I&#39;ve seen a few weird things in my life, but nothing like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please don&#39;t think I&#39;m crazy, I&#39;m usually pretty skeptical about these things, but to actually see it with my own eyes...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what else to say.  I can only hope that maybe there is some rational explanation for what I&#39;ve just seen.<n>

At about 3:30 a.m., I noticed a red dot moving roughly from west to east across the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be quite high in the sky, was moving at an incredible rate of speed, and was completely silent. It crossed my field of visibility in less than a minute&#39;s time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was no airplane and it certainly was not a meteor.<n>

We are both in our mid-20s, college graduates, work regular jobs, have NO experience with UFOS or aliens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While travelling back to port at Seattle from Victoria, BC, we happened to notice a meteor shower during the late evening of August 12th.  We ended up watching this meteor shower for several hours.  The meteors were amazing, ranging in many sizes and colors.  Around 1:40am (now Friday the 13th), my boyfriend noticed something unusual in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He saw two uniform spheres of light appear in the sky, move in a figure 8 motion, and then disappear.  He quickly tried to explain this to me in his bewildered state, but within a few seconds these two lights appeared in the sky again and we both saw them.  The spheres were always equidistant apart, as if they were attached by some invisible pole, and danced around each other very quickly and sharply.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights moved in a zig zag pattern, back and forth for abo! ut 5 seconds before flying a straight path over the ship and we could no longer see them from our balcony.  The lights were a little larger in comparison to the stars and seemed to appear from mid air in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We sat in shock for a very long time, trying to come up with a logical explanation, and hoping to see them again. These lights were absolutely not meteors, they moved in several different directions and left no light tail, and they were solid white lights, no blinking or shimmering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also thought that possible the military was trying some new type of aircraft, maybe a new invisible plane and all we could see were the two lights on it?   But there was no sound, and with the speed these lights were traveling I’d expect a very loud rocket sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So my theory is now that these lights were either one or two UFOs, maybe aliens use meteor showers to hide their arrivals?   I would definitely love to know if there is a logical explanation, I don’t think I will ever stop wondering what we saw and it may just drive me crazy!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was seen while we were in the Strait of Juan Fuca/Clallam Bay near Port Angeles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for getting back to me so quickly!  I will definitely have my boyfriend prepare his own independent statement.  Its just absolutely unbelievable, I never expected to see a UFO in my entire life.  Half of me still thinks there is no way I could have seen a UFO and there has to be some explanation, but the other half knows that there is nothing on Earth I know of that moves like that, and there is no way we both could have imagined seeing the exact same thing.  To be honest, I feel a little crazy.  I&#39;ve always believed in other life, its bogus to think that we are the only living planet in an unimaginably vast galaxy,  I guess I just never expected to see for myself.  Either way, it was a once in a lifetime experience and I would definitely welcome another! I will have my boyfriend, Eyad, submit his report though the web form.  Thank you again for contacting me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((2ND ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello Peter,<n> <n><n> <n><n> You can definitely use my additional comments.

I saw towards the north and a circular object with red and greenish-blue lights was hovering from side to side smoothly but straight up within seconds. I quickly told others and we ruled out it could not possibly be any aircraft given the way it was moving! Another member came out and we were in awe! THe UFO then went south passing above us at a high altitude and we heard sound......I immediately called my brother withing city limits and he saw it too and at the exact moment it was above me, there was a sound on our phones!!!!!! The UFO continued to travel south towards Mexico until it faded away.  It was too bizarre.....we are still in shock.....  Then at about 3:02am, we are about to go inside, when we see what appears to be the same object this time going straight up hovering from the East side, but farther awa! y.  It moved acros the sky towards the northwest and faded!

Though I thought this was unusual, we dismissed it and looked elsewhere in the sky for signs of the meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned my attention to the star, I found that it had moved Westward and toward the horizon significantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then watched its motions for several minutes, noting first to ourselves and then aloud that the object was swinging strangely from side to side.  This seemed curious especially due to its apparent distance from us.  If the presumed object seemed to us the size of a very bright star and it was performing such wide swinging motions and there was only a slight breeze that night, I assumed this might not be a conventional aircraft or an object being manipulated by air currents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking the rapid movements of our eyes may have caused this pattern of movement, I scanned the sky for a star and attempted to produce the same affects but could not.  The motion seemed to be real and not a product of autokinesis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We procured my Meade ETX-70AT Telescope upon my boyfriend&#39;s suggestion.  Magnification did not clarify any apparent shape of the object.  At times it is obscured by clouds.  Before it became obscured below the treeline, we observed it erratically blinking red, white, blue, and green.  No observed trail, surrounding haze, beams, spikes, glow or what have you.  No observed heat or odor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did not contact the police, ufo center, press, military, or nearby airports though we observed commercial aircraft concurrently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus, we wonder.

I went straight through the center of town and down South Main St., heading towards her street when I noticed a bright orange light in the sky, over the street on the right side of the road, just to the left of and slightly above the trees lining parts of the street.  I laughed and mentioned it to her, joking that maybe it was one of my dad&#39;s meteors (my dad had come home from work that night complaining that he had wanted to watch the meteors but it was too cloudy to see anything).  I also jokingly asked if she thought the insurance would cover it if it hit the car because it appeared to be descending fairly quickly.  I asked her if it looked like it was coming down and she said it sure did.  It was orange, similar in size and color to some of the street lamps in town but it was, at first, higher in the sky than the street lamps.  And as it got wat I believe to be lower, it also got slightly bigger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This friend and I have seen strange things in the past, one of which I also have reported to NUFORC (11/1/95, Randolph, &#34;Light appears over power lines&#34;).  And this was in the same area.  So I decided to drive down the same street we saw the other light.  Partly because I wanted to see if there may have been others by those power lines again and partly because I wanted to get off the main road so I could stop safely.  So I took a right and quick left to a parallel street and we still saw the light (so at this point I can be sure it was not a street light - with the trees and houses between the two streets it would be impossible).  I stopped the car in the middle of the street and we watched as the object got a bit lower and then turned sharply to our left (object&#39;s right).  At that point, my friend said, somewhat disappointed, &#34;Oh, I think it&#39;s a plane.&#34; And it kind of looked like airplane lights then, because the orange light had &#34;gone out&#34; as it turned and was replaced by ! 2 or 3 white lights, and it was traveling horizontally to our left instead of down.  Then, it turned again, sharply, heading away from us, going either back (kind of West, the direction we had been heading and were aimed at) or up, I couldn&#39;t really tell but it was moving.  So I started driving towards the end of the street, intending to get back on the main road to follow the object.  I had to take a left and then a quick right to get back the way we had been before (S. Main St. again) and I was driving as fast as I safely could because we lost sight of it.  When we got on the main road it was nowhere to be seen.  My friend had her face up against the windshield, trying to look up and around and neither of us could see anything.  I drove up the street a way and pulled into a parking lot and we looked.  Nothing anywhere.  And it was dead quiet too.  I got back on the road and drive my friend home (we had passed her house in our efforts to follow this thing).  I got out of t! he car at her house to look around a bit more but there was st! ill noth ing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a helicopter because a helicopter that close would have made noise and there was no noise.  And it did not maneuver like any airplane I have ever seen though when it &#34;became&#34; the white lights, it did kind of resemble airplane lights.  But the orange light was nothing I have seen on an airplane and we literally watched it go from one large orange light to 2 or 3 smaller white lights.  It definitely wasn&#39;t a meteor because of the movement (unless meteors change direction abruptly twice in the span of seconds and change looks the way I described).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I are both in our 30&#39;s and were not drinking or on drugs.  I have never seen anything like this in my life (compared to this, my previous encounter seems mild, though in the end both objects took off in the same direction; I am unable to get the link for my previous sighting to work, though, not sure why).  I&#39;d be glad to provide more details if needed.<n>
8/12/10 23:35|Virginia Beach|VA|Triangle|5-7 minutes|@ the intersection of Priness Anne Road & Upton Drive, near Red Mill Commons...|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77195.html|335|ndxe201008| @ the intersection of Priness Anne Road &amp; Upton Drive, near Red Mill Commons...<n> <n><n> <n><n> A buddy and I were heading home from grabbing a bite to eat when we stopped at a traffic light and saw three lights moving in one direction. My friend asked if I noticed that the far left light was behaving oddly; it wasn’t flashing, but it would seemingly disappear from view at random intervals. I thought it looked like a plane, at first, but the light positions and behavior didn’t correspond with those of typical navigation lights.  Right before the light turned green, the object seemed to stop.  I was close enough to the ground to use terrestrial objects as a reference for its position.  We then began travelling towards the object on a two lane highway, leading out to the rural part of town (I gather from the way it approached that this was where it was originally, before moving towards us).  The closer we got to it, the more we realized that it had stopped moving and was hovering over a field. It was frozen in place.  The radio was at a very minimal volume and we both had our windows down.  We were more than close enough to hear a jet turbine, prop chatter, etc. At our closest point I would imagine it was roughly 125 yards out in the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was triangular in shape, but somewhat thin from a side view.  It had three lights, one on each corner of the triangle shape, and a spotlight on the front (or in the direction was moving, rather), which was casting a fading cone shape, straight ahead.  For a brief period, I also noticed a faint blue light emanating from underneath the vessel. We pulled over in a turning lane just beyond our point of perp endicularity.  As we stopped, the car behind us pulled over in the same turning lane, just ahead of us. My friend got out of the car to catch a better look, but my view was perfect from inside the car.  Shortly after stopping, the craft began floating across the road we were travelling, not quite a quarter mile behind us.  It was directly above the street; I would wager it was about 150-200 feet above the ground.  It was travelling very slow and was heading behind the shopping center we had just left. We pulled up next to the other car and asked the driver if he saw what j! ust happened. He said he just got off the phone with his girlfriend, telling her about the hovering object.  He claimed he was a seasoned pilot and began commenting on the object&#39;s triangular shape and strange hovering.  He explained how the particular craft looked and behaved unlike anything he had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Side note:  This is a tough position to be in.  I used to mock those that reported UFOs, but now, I am one of them.  My friend and I, plus the other man in the car behind us, saw something that was simply unfathomable.  This was no faded smudge from a distance or a lightning fast stream of light; this was up close and personal.<n>

At about 10:30, we all laid on the deck and were enjoying the clear skies, stars, and a few meteors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after 11, my sister’s boyfriend pointed out a very bright glow (appeared golf ball sized) to the east.  We all sat up to look, at first thinking it was a meteor.  The light appeared to be getting closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 30 seconds or so, we knew it wasn’t a meteor because we could see the light was coming from some type of aircraft.  It appeared to be a headlight, the beam went out into the night sky like a flashlight.  It was NOT a spotlight—it did not shine down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued to move forward, it was moving west.  On one side of the craft was a small blue light and on the other side a small red light, similar to airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the craft moved overhead we could see it was triangular shaped and was close, not so close where we’d be alarmed but closer than airplanes normally fly.  We watched as the craft very quietly moved west , dipped and glided toward the north, dipped down and up a few more times, and was finally out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all stunned at what we saw and returned to the deck to continue watching for meteors.  Less than 5 minutes later from the same point in the sky, the bright yellow circular glow appeared again.  We witnessed the same thing again with the same (if not very similar) flight pattern.  This time we all heard what we describe as a &#34;whirring&#34; noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this one was out of view we began to walk from the front yard to the back yard again when we immediately saw another one of the exact same appearance.  This led us to believe there were minimally 2 separate crafts since our 2nd sighting had vanished only seconds earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister’s boyfriend left at 11:40 p.m..  My sister and I drove south down Dixie Highway for about 5 minutes in an attempt to find better views.  As we turned around and headed back, we had our 4th sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister’s boyfriend called shortly after midnight (8/13/10) to say he was outside of his home in Trenton, MI, and was witnessing the same yellow glow.  However, this time the glow hovered at a farther distance for several minutes.  It did not move overhead to reveal the triangular shaped aircraft, but instead simply hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I stayed outside until approximately 2:00 a.m. (8/13/10) and saw a few more meteors but did not have another sighting of the aircraft.  We emailed our local channel 4 news to see if anyone else reported a sighting or if there was an possibility of some type of military practice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We haven’t heard anything back and have not found any other reports online.<n>
8/12/10 23:00|Tecumseh|KS|Circle|3-4 minutes|Slow-moving, glowing white/orange ball|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77172.html|338|ndxe201008| Slow-moving, glowing white/orange ball<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were driving East towards Tecumseh, just outside Topeka, to watch the Perseid meteor shower when we saw a bright white light that sort of had an orange glow ahead of us.  It was about twice the size of Venus (as it appears during this time of year).<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought maybe it was an abnormally bright light on top of a radio tower or that it was Venus but since it was larger, brighter and had a steady glow, I started to think maybe it was a plane or helicopter falling from the sky...  It looked like a ball of fire and it moved at a slow, steady speed downwards toward the horizon (I stopped my car for a moment to make sure it was actually moving).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it gradually started to move diagonally towards the north, then almost completely parallel to the horizon and then down until I could no longer see it because of trees on the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I have no idea how large it was or how far away it was, it was about 40 degrees from the eastern horizon when we first saw it.  It also had a steady glow, didn&#39;t twinkle or fade out or anything.  Just stayed a constant brightness comparable to Venus&#39;s but white with a slightly orange outline and an almost burning appearance (which might not make it a steady glow... but it didn&#39;t flicker or anything.  It just seemed to &#34;boil&#34; slightly as a ball engulfed in flames would).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I considered the idea that it could be something someone had shot into the air, like some sort of firework that came falling to the ground but it appeared to be very far away and thus would be quite large (I&#39;m not sure if you can really measure the distance of something with no idea what the object is... or how large it is... so this guess is based on the fact that the trees in the horizon were probably a mile away or so).<n>

On the date of August 12th 2010 I seem to have witnessed an extraterrestrial event. I have taken into consideration that this could be it a meteor, but I have come to the conclusion that it was not a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting on the couch in my living room watching for meteors the would inevitably come into view tonight.

Traveling west to east on Rt 49 I noticed two glowing red lights to my right over a hill rise before entering the town of Elkland. Did not think about it again until,after passing through the town and picking up speed ,I approached the steel suspension bridge as one exits the town . The red lights were on my right  cresting a mountain and appeared stationary . I recalled thinking that there must have been another plane tower  erected or perhaps a cell tower on that side as there already exists a plane tower dotted with red lights across the river on the left side mountain. As I crossed the bridged i was shocked to see the red lights were moving closer and down off the mountain towards me. They crossed right above me perhaps 50 feet overhead swiftly and without a sound then hovered above a man made containment pond about 30 yards off of the highway on farm land. I stopped my car ,rolled down the window and looked up . ! The twin spheres were predominantly red thought they glowed a bright orange then slid into a molten silver before turning red again this color change was cyclical and patterned. The sky was overcast as rain was forecasted . There were no stars or airplanes visible. There was no other cars on the road and i became increasingly concerned the longer I remained stopped for fear of fast coming traffic as the road there is a narrow 2 lane 55 mph corridor . I continued to watch the spheres  as they  glowed soundless over the pond. They were situated side by side. I felt compelled to leave for fear of arriving late for work and finally pulled away after 10 minutes of observing the globes. The strange part of my experience  is that I was calm and somewhat detached watching this shocking event. I completely forgot to use my cell to catch a picture or call 911 or even my husband...never even considered it. When I got to work and relayed my experience people thought I was crazy for not! sticking around to watch the ufo&#39;s(?) fly off...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor told me the next day that her brother was visiting his hunting camp and saw similar red globes. His property is about 20 miles away from my sighting due south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I  am submitting this report now only because I stumbled onto this site . The event is as vivid in my mind as if it occurred yesterday.<n>

It was shaped like a flat V. It was black with glowing lights. The lights were not very bright. More glowing than shining. It mostly resembled the Phoenix Lights incident. I live an hour away from Whitemans Air Forfce base in Missouri. Although it made no sound at all, I have seen the B-2 Stealth bomber many times and I would have not been mistaken. There is a nuclear facility in South Kansas City being made. Reports have indicated that unidentified flying objects have been attracted to nuclear sites.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
8/12/10 20:34|Topsfield|MA|Other|2 minutes|The lights were not sharp and pronounced, but instead were hazy and burned like fire, scattered about the bottom and sides of the UFO.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77162.html|347|ndxe201008| It was 8:34PM and already pitch black outside.  Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the plane lights wavering behind the tree&#39;s as the aircraft approached. I had assumed that it was a plane anyways.  I sat at the glass door for a moment, watching the lights approach as I usually did- out of habit more than anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the seconds passed, I noticed that the aircraft seemed to be rising forward into the air at an accelerating velocity- one that seemed almost unusually fast.  I continued to watch in curiosity.  In less than a second, the aircraft made a 390 degree turn, a full circle and then off to the right. There was no way it could be a plane, so I ran outside to see it better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it flew above the tree-line, I noticed that the lights didn&#39;t look anything like the ones on a plane and the shape of the vehicle was extremely unusual.  The lights were not sharp and pronounced, but instead were hazy and burned like fire, scattered about the bottom and sides of the UFO. They were pale yellow to bluish-green in color and seemed to be linked by thinner lines of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO itself was not a sleek thin design like I might have imagined it to be.  The main body appeared dark grey and semi-metallic (it reminded me of silicon) and pyramidal, but had abstract shaped parts attached to the main body, creating a shape that is nearly indiscernible to describe from such a short observation period.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued off to the right for a moment before all of the lights on the aircraft immediately shut off.  I could still see the body due to light pollution and a faint glow that seemed to radiate from the UFO, preventing it from becoming completely hidden.  It changed course in a matter of milliseconds and accelerated again in a sharp upward direction before it was out of eyesight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for a little longer and saw something that made me almost laugh in awe.  What I could see to be as several military fighter jets came into my sight only moments later, uniformly chasing in the same direction I had seen the unidentified aircraft travel before disappearing.  They, I noticed, travelled at a speed and in a manner that I had expected human constructed planes to fly.  And they were far behind.<n>

I happened to walk onto our second floor glass elevator. When I looked out I noticed a black sphere way up in the sky.  At first I thought I was seeing things but I kept staring and it wasn&#39;t moving just there in the sky.  The weather was beautiful the sky was clear no clouds but this object stood out.  I had stepped off the elevator to drop paperwork off went back to elevator within a minute and the object was gone.  I knew it wasn&#39;t a plane, or a helicopter, or a goodyear blimp.  I&#39;m not sure what it was but I do know it was round because of the distance it appeared to be black.  The building I work in has three elevators, I was in the middle one.  The elevators have glass all around when I look out I could see the Secaucus area, the turnpike, further down open space with a view of the road and other cities.  It took place at exactly 2:15pm. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have my cell phone on me to take a picture of what I was seeing.<n>

Bridgeport reservoir.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister and I were fishing the Bridgeport reservoir from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm we were anchored in the Buckeye channel both facing north, and at about 1:00 pm we herd an extremely loud buzzing sound that was making a shallow dive.  It dove 10Ft in front of me.  The object was a blur, and the speculating speed of the object is 125 to 150 mph.  By viewing the splash of 6 inches width x 11 inches length zipper shape.  I discovered that object has approximately two counter rotating props when it drove it self into the water.  The props are approximately 5 inch in diameter on a approximately 1 inch diameter x 12 inches fuselage.  I thought that this is the creature called the Flying Spikes, but this is not a creature but a mechanical projectile supposedly from the military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived to port at 6:00 pm we saw a GMC suburban with four tuff looking men inside just waiting, and when I came up to the suburban the driver said how is it going?  As I past the suburban I over herd one of the men inside say, he’s with his sister.  How do they know I’m with my sister?<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back to our campsite, we herd and saw two gray C130 planes flying over use, extremely low through the cannon towards Bridgeport. Putting 2 &amp; 2 together, I think we have a top secret recover taking place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The crash site Position Coordinates is as followed:  38* 16’ 41n 119* 14’ 48w<n>

There&#39;s one craft that I mainly see up there cruising around changing directions in a way that a plane could not, the craft is also illuminating red, blue, and green flashing lights.  Tonight as I was watching this craft another craft flew directly over my apartment to high to make out the size.  I live near the airport so I am familiar of airplanes and this was not an airplane.  This craft was v shaped with red lights on the bottom.   It looked like it was at the height of a plane but made no sound, I watched to see if it descended to the airport which it did not.  The craft instead moved higher into the sky at an angle until it was gone.  There is some serious activity going on in the skies above Boise lately and it seems to now be a reoccuring thing.<n>

Rite before the big battle i paused it and went out for a smoke, immediatly i started battling mosquitoes as i am now! it was around 8.40 pm and not a cloud in the sky when i looked up to see what i thought was a star northwest almost rite above me. I decided to take some shots just in case it wasnt. I took three shots on super hi-res Raw, decided then i didnt want to wait for the data to load and miss somthing, i set it back to Hi-res Raw, where i can get six shots in a row instead of two. I then looked back at the star and it didnt move or change magnitude, I squashed the mosquitoes into a bloody mush that where sucking my legs and head and ripped six more shots before i dove back in the house. I didnt have my computer, forgetting it at moms, until today. I looked at the back of the camera enlarging it and saw a star, whatever! I then continued watching B.S.G. until it was over, about five minutes and went out for a smoke again because the mosquitoes ended my last one early and i was high on coffee. I looked back up in the sky, no star! it was gone!! not a star in the twilight sky anywhere yet. I ran back in grabbing my camera and started looking at all the photos of the disapearing star. When i got to the second photo my heart dropped it wasnt a star at all!!! As i looked at the V, UFO i couldnt figure out if it was  a trailer of a single solid object from a long exposure or the object moving during the exposure viewing it on the back of the camera. When i got my computer back today i checked and i still have no idea but im bending more to the object moving during exposure only because a few seconds later when i took more shots they where all solid, objects, but i could be wrong. Also I relised later that night that in 2000 my buddy Cain and i had a huge sighting in Blind River probably on this! very night 10 years ago during the Perseides metor shower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Photos not of a genuine UFO, we believe.

We have witnessed several obvious disks wobbling/zigzagging through the sky on multiple occasions in this area, but never anything like what we witnessed on this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very dark and moonless night.  I was scanning the treeline with my binoculars while my friend observed with his eyes.  Through my binoculars I noticed a cluster of several hexagonal yellow lights. This was not a constellation, or any star formation.  It immediately stunned me because I am very familiar with the area as I go there all the time, it is one of the best places to see the sky clearly close to Morgantown.  I got my friend&#39;s attention and observed it with my naked eye. It was a large, quarter size at arm&#39;s length, cluster of hexagonal lights blinking on and off.   We could not tell for sure if this was several objects hovering together, or lights on a larger craft, but it did appear that it was a singular craft as we were both able, through binoculars, to see smaller objects flying around the craft.  Both of us felt frightened by what we saw.   We observed the object for about 25 minutes. It never moved suddenly or swiftly but it did appear to be getting smaller and! farther away as the sighting went on.   Eventually, we left as it was getting late.  The object was still observable when we headed home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do want to remain totally anonymous, as I never report the objects we witness in that area, but I decided to submit this account because it was an especially startling sighting and unlike anything I or my friend had seen before.

The light was a off-white color, almost yellowish.  There were NO blinking lights on the craft like you would normally see on a normal aircraft.  After it flew by, I could still see the bright light, but then I could make out 3 white lights in the rear.  It was too dark to see the shape of the craft.  Did I mention it was very quiet?  Normally a craft flying overhead, you can see the blinking lights, and normally at that altitude you can hear the jet engines.  I did not.  All lights were an off-white to yellowish color, and I could not hear the engines.  Looked to be traveling at normal speeds of a jet craft. Maybe 400-500mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> People up near the Wisconsin border or even Kenosha may have seen it too if it kept going that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The things we saw looked like stars but they were moving rapidly across the sky, much faster than a jet. We watched them until they eventually got dim and disappeared.  We saw them one after another.  Each one was in our vision for about 4 minutes.  The last one we saw eventually slowed down and started to zig zag like crazy.  They were all going north to south or south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other interesting thing was the airplanes that were out. They were constantly going back and forth across the sky. They had one bright red light on the left side that was constant, and a strange pattern of white lights blinking.  One was low enough for us to see, and it was a triangle shape, like a b-2 bomber.<n>

It kept moving left in weird jerky movement, until it had moved behind a tree and we could no longer see.  Later farther west we saw something similar, but it was smaller, and this time it was moving right, but slower.<n>

8/11/10 20:00|Freeland|MI|Light|10 minutes|First colorful light far in sky then 3 lights in a row, Saginaw County, MI|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78809.html|363|ndxe201008| First colorful light far in sky then 3 lights in a row, Saginaw County, MI<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all I want to start by saying I am not crazy, last night at about 8pm my boyfriend and I were going to his house in mid-michigan and were going down a somewhat country road to get there, the road had houses on it but we were the only car on the road. While on the road I saw a light in the sky that was far away that looked like a weird star or planet or something and after he saw it we started arguing about what it was, it wasn&#39;t moving but he said it was a plane and so I pulled over to prove it wasn&#39;t moving, it then started moving back and forth so we were both wrong and we saw a plane pass below it (it was definitely a plane). I started getting a bad feeling and said we should go so we continued driving down the road when (and this is the part where i swear i&#39;m not crazy, we both saw exactly the same thing) three lights in a row came out of nowhere and started coming directly towards us. It was flying very low, too low to be a plane and almos! t in the tree line, at this point I was the most scared I have ever been in my life, it was not stopping and my boyfriend was telling me not to stop the car but I turned it around as fast as I could and started going as fast as I could the opposite way, I was telling him to call 911 and he got out my phone and had the number dialed but didn&#39;t call and when we got close to a more main road and started seeing other cars I started to feel better.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was near tears when we got to the main road and once we got there he tried to say it could have been another plane, so I insisted we go to the airport, once there he went in and talked to a sheriff and airport worker who said that the only flight that came in was from Chicago, this all happened before 8:30pm. We then concluded that there was no way it could have been a plane, (my boyfriend is very rational and level-headed) after the airport he told me that while we were driving, whatever had been in front of us was driving directly next to us less than a quarter mile away, he got a vague look at it and said it had no wings or tail. This was the most terrifying experience I have ever had and I almost can&#39;t believe it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The ball had unpredictable movements it moved up and I saw a series of lights pretty much covering the bottom of the craft all the while is was still moving across the sky as it got closer I noticed it changed from a cigar type shape to a shape similar to a boat.  I watched it fly over my apartment building until I could not see it anymore and then I ran into the house.<n>

The object was travaling about 500 miles per hour. I told my friend to stop the car and look and she saw it to. We got out of the car to get a better look and it fized out as it flew through the casiopa constellation.  A bright light just then seemed to cetch my eyes about 75 to 100 feet over our heads as it flew silently fast just above our heads.  I was frightened enough to run and jump back in to the car.<n>

Every morning before I get into my car I look at the sky since I like looking at the stars. You could see them pretty well that early in the morning even with all the city lights.  It all seemed very normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While i was driving a cop started following me. I looked in the rear view mirror to look at him them back at the road. That&#39;s when i noticed the star.  It seemed like it moved. It wasn&#39;t a shooting star or a meteor . It was just a static white light, no pulsing, no color changes, and no movement. While i was looking at it, it zoomed away.  This movement didn&#39;t look normal. The light smeared across the sky. The best way i can describe it is the way the stars look in movies when they go light speed. While it zoomed away the color and the shape were the same just elongated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was white light like a bunch of stars linked together to form a line about an inch wide from my perspective.  And it tilted down to the right a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was thinking how it couldn’t be a plane or anything like that because those are usually one dot and slowly moving.  This was like if an edge of a coin were lit up in a line and it wasn’t really moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it slowly tilted with purpose (again this was strange to me because if it were a man made prop or something far away the effort to so even would be quite difficult) like when you weigh something with those doctor scales and you get the lead weight right it kind of has this slow settling into place as it gets its balance.  Like that. It tilted in that ‘gaining balance’ way for another 20 degrees tilting down on the right side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly it looked like it was moving forward away from me for a moment and then I got this sense of a burst of incredible speed because the lights became smaller so quick they practically winked out they were gone so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not tired. I was not drunk.  I have never made such a claim before.  I saw my first UFO.  I have no idea what it was alien, military, or otherwise but Unidentified Flying Object.  Oh yes.<n>

The UFO also has 2 bright white strobe lights down the middle of the triangle at opposing ends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Wednesday at about 1am,  August 11,  2010, I was getting out of my truck at work and quickly glanced at an aircraft flying overhead at a low altitude from the south heading toward the north.  At first, I thought that it was a commercial jet, yet as I took a moment to focus my gaze, I realized that there was something unusual about it.   I see commercial jets and helicopters flying over head at times, but I didn’t hear any sound from this flying object and that the lights displayed didn’t fit the description of a plane or helicopter that I’ve seen before.  The UFO travelled at a steady pace similar to a commercial jet until it faded in the distance.  I witnessed this UFO cross overhead from the south heading toward the north for about 10 seconds until it was out of my sight.  I would say that looking north, the UFO was heading north with a slight 10-20 degrees toward the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other than witnessing the UFO, I did notice a helicopter passing overhead shortly before this sighting.  As I witnessed the UFO, the helicopter appeared further north and from the west.   It stopped in the direction the UFO was heading.  The UFO continued north past the helicopter out of my sight while the helicopter slowly followed it until it too was out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Background:  A happily married male in mid twenties.

Like it was hovering. I watched it the whole way to work which was about a 10 min drive, but my friend who also works at the same place saw the same exact thing on his way to work behind me about 15 minutes after me. It had red lights in a diamond/pyramid shape, but was blinking like an airliner plane. I don&#39;t know if it was military or whatever...i&#39;m sure there were things going on beyond what they let the general people know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was in my back kitchen about to get a drink of water when the whole kitchen became full of orange light.  I was watching them through my kitchen window which faces towards my back garden.  I had two huge orange balls of light slowly hovering towards me about 30 feet from me at terraced rooftop height they got to about 10 feet from me then one just disappeared and the other flew off towards the clouds and was in the clouds in about 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a moonlight night and I got the impression that as soon as they entered my garden that they spotted me and took the action they did.  During the week there were lots of reports about orange balls of light being seen.  I got the impression that they were scouting for something in the way that they stayed close together and in the way they glided towards me.  I have tried to fathom out why I was privileged to see them so close, but cannot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a true statement.<n>

On the 8th.of August 2010 I looked out of my window and saw in the sky, a light, travelling in a SE. to NW. direction.  I went outside and looked up at the light, it was red to orange in colour and in a figure of eight configuration with the two balls of the eight off set.  I watched this light and when it was almost directly overhead it slowed, stopped, then faded into two little white dots, and disappeared.  I realised that what looked like a single figure of eight shaped light was actually two separate round red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 14th.of Aug, my wife and I saw a red ball of light come over the Campsie Fells (which are 10 miles distant to the north) and fly towards us in a N. to S. direction.  When at a distance of approximately one quarter of a mile to our left it slowed, stopped, then disappeared.  About 30 seconds later another red light appeared over the Campsie Fells and travelled towards us, it slowed then stopped at exactly the same spot as did the first. This went on at very regular intervals for some time, red lights travelling towards us, stopping and then disappearing. Although I didn&#39;t time them, the lights took about one and a half minutes to travel the 10miles from the Campsie Fells.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night I looked over towards the Kilsyth Hills which are really a continuation of the Campsie fells and saw a red light, then another come over these hills and disappear at some distance from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is no way these lights could be Chinese lanterns.  They travelled at speed in the same trajectory, stopped, then disappeared in exactly the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the 17th.of August we saw two more red lights travelling in a NW. to SE. direction then disappear.<n>

When I stepped outside I saw some lights off the in the distance and it was dark so they were easy to spot.  At first they were kinda far away so after 30 seconds or so I realized I was looking at 7 fireball spheres of plasma energy in single file formation spaced 1 after another spaced about 100-200 ft apart from one another.  They were about 6 ft in diameter going a slow 15-20 mph just floating over my head not more than 500 ft off the ground in a crowded residential area with a shopping mall just a few miles away. They looked like miniature suns, u could see inside it and realize there was no machinery whatsoever. It was all swirling fiery plasma, like a liquid lava lamp but being powered by a nuclear furnace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I realized what I was witnessing, I knew I had no camera so the next best thing would be witnesses so I ran back inside and my gfs mom was watching survivor and I told her she had to come see this so she goes out and cant believe her eyes so my gf is all the way inside and up in her bedroom so I have to run up and tell her theres ufos outside u gotta hurry if ure going to see them.  When she made it outside she got to see the last 3 or 4 floating off. I have been a huge believer in ufos before my sighting but my gfs mother is a catholic who doesnt like science fiction at all.  She would be the least likely person ever to believe in et&#39;s but she does now.

I have often witnessed satellites smoothly moving across the night skies, looking like the stars, but just moving quietly, quickly and smoothly.  Tonight, though, I witnessed two very distinct but small white lights moving across the sky from south to north, straight across the sky, more quickly than I’ve seen anything, other than the &#34;shooting stars,&#34; but nearly at that speed.  They moved in a completely straight line, in a directly northerly direction.  They were next to each other, but in a formation where one was slightly in front of the other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That’s it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing other than that, but definitely not aircraft, satellites, meteorites or space junk.<n>

Tonight I went out on my routine walk before bed.  As I was walking west maybe half a mile from my home, I noticed two lights maneuvering around in the sky in the west.  They seemed to be over the city of Lehi and near the Oquirrh Mountains.  I stood and watched them for a minute or two.  They&#39;re maneuvers were so odd.  One would circle the other, they would drop and climb large distances at surprising speed.  After a few moments I decided to carry on watching them at a park just down the street, where a hill would provide a more unobstructed view.  I ran down the street and up the hill and continued to watch.  More odd movements. At a few points, they went from what seemed thousands of feet in the sky, and dropped below the tree line where I couldn&#39;t see them, and came back minutes later.  After they climbed back into the sky, they would stay pretty still for! a while and then begin to move around again.  I know there is a military base nearby, Camp Williams, but I have lived in the area my whole life and never seen anything like this.  I suppose it could have been some sort of training operation, but the movement those lights made were very strange to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed the light because of its color, and the fact that it appeared to be at a low altitude, lower than planes would occupy, and it seemed to be hovering over the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I reached my home, about a minute and a half later, and looked in the direction of the light, it was still there, but seemed to be moving slowly.  My husband and I watched the light for several minutes as it seemed to drift away from us.  Before it disappeared from view, another light appeared from the same direction as the first one, and behaved in the same manner.

I wasn’t planning to report this but this was really bugging me.  I’m not 100% sure about the date, but it was in the August of 2010. I was trying to sleep but I couldn’t, so I just stared at the stars out the window.  Right then I saw large, strange shaped aircraft flying not fast but not slow.  At first I thought it was a plane but it was flying to close to the ground, it was pretty huge and it was shaped like an oval.  It was flashing about 10 lights and it was kind of like one of those ships in star wars.  I immediately yelled at my mom who was watching T.V. next door and she saw it too.  I grabbed my self phone and ran out to take a picture of it, but it was too far ahead for my phone to take picture of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw the bottom of the craft. It was oval, and there was two lines crossing each other forming a cross.  There were about 10 lights were lined up on the cross, the lights were red and green I believe, I’m not 100% sure about green but I definitely saw red.

It was around midnight. This road is very rural with woods on both sides.  It was foggy out.  I was going about 35 miles per hour when from right in from of my car, up in the sky, a flaming creature fell in front of my car.  It was about 8 inches wide.  It was in full flame while it was falling.  Once it hit the ground, it was glowing with embers.  I drove over it because everything happened so quickly. My friend was texting on her phone and I asked her if she had just seen what happened and she didn’t.  I stopped the car and looked behind the car through the back window to prove it was there, and it had apparently disappeared.  But I know what I saw, and it really did happen.<n>

It was moving faster than the plane that was going east, although we don&#39;t know how close the plane was to the object.  We saw it moving for about fifteen seconds, and then it paused in midair for about thirty seconds.  Then about a third of it broke apart and fell.  The light then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The evening of Monday, August 9th, I was walking my dog along our regular route, which I have walked for many years. It was approx 10 PM.  I was walking southbound along a small creek.  It was a hot, humid night, clear dark sky, no moon that I could see. To my left, eastward, an object came into view over the treetops.  For a second, I thought it was a full, orange, harvest moon.  It was about the size of a large full moon in the sky and glowed orange. It took me a second to realize that the object was moving, travelling east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then thought it had to be a meteor. However, this object did not streak or fall, nor did it have a trail. I stood there gaping at it as it passed directly overhead; when it was directly above me the orange glow became an orange &#34;halo&#34; around what i could see was an object with rounded edges.  It appeared to be maybe 3500-4000 up; was completely silent, and travelled somewhat faster than an airplane,  While directly above, the object appeared about &#34;dime size&#34; in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the glowing fireball object as it continued west, until it was just a dot in the sky, and then i couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  The entire event was about 30-40 seconds in duration.  I was completely mind-boggled;  I literally could not believe my eyes.  I did snap a couple pics with my phone camera after it had passed overhead, but the object appears much smaller and further away than it actually was.  I&#39;m not a photographer; didn&#39;t think to use the video camera feature, did not even think to zoom in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local Airport Authority the following day and asked if this could have been a weather balloon, or if anyone else had reported seeing this weird glowing thing in the sky.  I was advised they had no reports; also that it would not have been a weather ballon. I&#39;m completely at a loss as to what it could have been.  Googling since then, i have learned that these &#34;fireball&#34; sightings are common recently!  I can attest that the one i saw was not a &#34;ball&#34; as when it passed directly overtop of me I could see that it was most definitely not lit up or glowing from the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still can&#39;t quite believe it! I have never seen anything like this! I did not upload the pics, but would be willing to share them if asked.<n>

I was located in Spokane Valley, WA and, I was looking directly above me when my sighting took place and the angle of elevation was 90 degrees.  I witnessed approximately 40 or more brightly lit objects/orbs of orange and reddish light in a formation/straight line above me moving east very quickly.  The objects themselves were in motion as they maintained the line formation, and they appeared to move in front of each other and around each other.  Formation then changed shape from a line to a V.  Objects appeared to be the same size as the stars and appeared to be at a high altitude based on my observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A closed fist at arm’s length when the formation/cluster was directly above me covered about 1/10th of the formation.  The cluster of objects was very large across the sky.  No other witnesses were present at time of sighting, and objects made no noise whatsoever as they went overhead from west to east.  Objects then changed shape into a V formation, and then disappeared from view to the east after about ten seconds.  Speed of objects was very fast, covering the sky and off to the east in seconds.  Speed of the objects was constant the whole time.  It was almost hard to follow them because of the speed.  I have been an amateur meteorologist for about 15 years and I watch the sky daily and observe weather conditions and aircraft all the time from my residence.  I can say with much certainty that the objects I witnessed were not any known aircraft, stars or planets.  This was in the lower atmosphere and seemed very unusual to me.  I have never witnessed anything like this, an! d I would love to find out more on what this may have been.  Feel free to contact me for any more info.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n>

I pulled over to watch them and videoed for 20 minutes.  While videoing them, they didn&#39;t appear to be moving.  After review of the video, they were indeed moving slowly, noticed by a point of reference in the video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought possibly it was a bright star or planet (even though I have never seen a star or planet this bright), so I rushed home to grab my camera and tripod.  I was going to attempt to do a long exposure photograph that would capture the star trails as the earth spun to see if these lights were of the same pattern.  As I went back out to the vicinity of the lights, I noticed they were much farther away.  They were moving in a west / south-west direction.  I attempted to get on the interstate to follow them (I-16 west), but they were moving too fast for me to keep up and eventually I lost them in the trees in the western sky.<n>

To my surprise I saw a floating black object which seemed to be staying in the same position a little to the left of the mountain range as I was driving by.  The best I can describe the shape is like a thin slice of black, I may have been to far away to get the full definition of the craft. But it hung in the same spot for at least 5-8 minutes, had me staring the entire time till it started moving slowly towards Las Vegas strip and disappeared behind the mountain range. It was rather strange, I&#39;ve never seen anything like that. I have been to many airshows and I don,&#39;t really know to many aircraft that can stay in the same place unless it was a helicopter from really far away, but after review, I ruled that out judging from Its shape. It was like black plate that appeared statio! nary for about 5-8 mins, then slowly moved behind the range and out of my sight. I have never seen something like this I couldn&#39;t explain<n>

There was a green glowing patch of object that was in the sky.  The object was slightly oblong in shape and the size was hard to determine but possibly about the relative apparent area of 20 &#34;stars&#34; ( as it was the only thing I can compare it to). there was only 1 of these object. the object remained stationary for the sighting. i believe that it was a UFO sighting contrary to search lights because vancouver search lights are not green, it was emitting green light that was not uniform within the surface seen, the green light was slightly covered by clouds as they moved by and then revealed again. there appeared to be a slight cloudy area around the object. to further describe the green light, the light quality had &#34;noise&#34; and the light was similar to that seen in LCD/LED clocks and watches.  the object observed was slightly towards the southwest direction from where i was standing and this would&#39;ve been towards the juan de fuca straight. i did not watch until it left my sight.  but when i put my head down and looked up again,  its position has moved in relation to the stars, further south. the neighbouring stars were quite bright but unfortunately i was not able to identify them.<n>
8/8/10 22:00|El Paso|TX|Light|10 minutes|Strange star-like object hovering over El Paso mountains, almost hit car and swooped down below the road (on mountain) disappearing.|10/23/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/103/S103296.html|406|ndxe201008| Strange star-like object hovering over El Paso mountains, almost hit car and swooped down below the road (on mountain) disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outside at night with 3 other people in my backyard. It was around 10:40PM or so, nearing 11PM. From my backyard I am able to see a view of the El Paso mountains in the distance, and am able to see Transmountain Road, which is a long road that is a shortcut to get from the northeast side of town to the west side by cutting through rather than going around the mountain.  From our view you can see the headlights driving by from the cars in a certain area that drive by, but they are high up in elevation on the lower half of the mountain from the view we have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two of us (myself and another) were sitting in the backyard facing away from the mountain, while the other two were sitting able to view the mountains and transmountain road, and one of them noticed this faint light above the mountains, she pointed and asked what it was, it was probably a hundred feet above or so, not sure but it was high up enough to look like a star, because that&#39;s what we thought it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thankfully, she didn&#39;t believe it was a star - and kept staring at it and suddenly told us it was moving, so we all turned to focus on it, it was so faint we didn&#39;t think anything of it for a couple of minutes except it was this hazy purple, it was the exact coloring if you stare at a black light, you can&#39;t really focus on it and it had this purple tone to it.  We thought there might be a cloud in front, but it was a clear night, the object was hazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So trying to focus on it in the sky, we can begin to see this faint purple/blue light begins to slowly move, side to side, diagonally, in very unusual patterns at different speeds, and then it began to slowly fly behind the mountain, and as we watched it, for about 5 to 10 seconds it went out of sight.  We thought that was all there was to it, but we stayed looking, we all kind of wished it would come back, and we got our wish...<n> <n><n> <n><n> It suddenly came back up and began to float down the mountain but it moves down in different ways, at first it went straight down and then diagonally, just erratic movements and it suddenly gets closer to the cars that are driving on transmountain, so we see this faint purple light get closer and closer to the cars and two of us are really scared that it will crash down, but the other two people with me tried to get out a really bad telescope of mine that didn&#39;t work properly - but hoping to be able to use it to see what this object is!  Then it suddenly pauses in front of one of the cars, almost like the object hit the brakes and it lights up so brightly I squinted, and we all just gasped in awe and fear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then immediately it shot down below the road into the base of the mountain near an area that has no residential homes, it shot down from the right, then to the left and then out of sight. Being so scared we were expecting to see it come back up into the sky, maybe even fly over us but thankfully nothing.  We called into the non emergency phone line in El Paso to ask if anyone had seen strange lights, and they told us no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, a day later we went up to Transmountain to see if we could see anything below in the desert, and of course we found nothing unusual looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve seen in the mid 90&#39;s strange objects in the sky over Ft. Bliss (military base) area which is east of where I lived, objects that would blink and shine light onto the roof of the house in front of ours (without any sound, like a helicopter light should have), but never have I seen this black light colored object, erratically flying around near where a lot of cars drive back and forth 24/7, and if it was anything government made, we wondered why it would be so close to cars, seemed dangerous.  I just wonder if the drivers on Transmountain saw the object, because when it lit up so bright it seemed everyone would have been able to see it!  But it seems nobody noticed it but us that night, and we stayed out for many nights after that hoping to see it again but we haven&#39;t yet.<n>

I noticed a single bright light at approximately a 50 degree angle up and to the east, traveling from south to north and was silent. The light was atleast 4 times biggerthan any star in the sky. The skies were clear except for a few clouds on the horizon to the north.  The object was intensely bright and had a shimmering copper look to it. It took the light approximately 1 to 1.5 minutes or so to reach the horizon where it blinked out over the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a picture with my cell phone, and zoomed in on the photos revealing a bright round object with red/ orange on the top half and white on the bottom half.  There is also a slight yellow blur in the middle and a yellowish contrail.<n>

Felt good, was standing outside when noticed a low flying, largish bright orange sphere in horizon.  Kept staring at it as it looked so &#34;wrong&#34;.  I was waiting for the light to blink like a plane.   But this never happened.  It continued to move slowly,  then gradually seemed to shrink and disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later there was another of the same sort. This one did not disappear, just gradually went out of sight?(trees and horizon)  This was followed by yet ANOTHER oddity though from a different direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looked like one of those small moving stars.  Only as it got overhead another light came on directly on the side of it.  Like two tiny ones moving together, or lights on the same object?   Again the lights did not blink like a plane.   Was flying low and silent in the horizon.     Thought I saw the outline of metal around the lights  but I am not sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange!<n>

They think the whole idea of UFO’s are silly and have little to no knowledge on the subject.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were leaving the swimming pool and walking to the cellar doors which are about 10 feet away.  It was around 9 pm and was almost dark out.   We noticed a bright light on the ground in the middle of the yard and looked up.  There were four really bright lights just hovering there, they were about the size of basketballs.   There were three outer lights that formed a triangle and one in the middle.  The lights were very bright and white; we could not make out any details of a plan, ships etc…  My sister handed me the digital camera (we had been taking underwater pictures in the pool, so we had the camera with us) and we took four pictures.  I am not sure what setting my camera was on; I just turned it on and took pictures.  There was no sound except for some kind of whishing noise when it took off.  I’m not sure how long it hovered, seconds.  Then it slowly drifted across the backyard toward the woods and then took off and was gone.  As it took off it turned to the left and! seemed to leave trails of light for just a few seconds.  We were very scared and are not sure what it was.<n>

It was at about 25,000 feet.  I couldn&#39;t tell if the lights were internal or external.   Both lights were coming from the same object.

It was much smaller than the jetliner, though I couldn&#39;t tell if it was a smaller jet or not, couldn&#39;t see wings on it. This lasted until both were not seen, approx 3 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never witnessed such an occurrence before while watching jetliners going over Yakima, WA heading toward SeaTac Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

From the West end of Madison, where it intersects with DT, the light was slightly north west, appearing just above the tree line.  I have observed that there is a cell tower in that vicinity, however the light that I saw appeared to be acting more similarly to the light of a lighthouse than the on/off blink of these towers.  The light changed from a large red to a smaller, dimmer yellowish amber - similar to that of stars.  And then it appeared to fly off.   At first I suspected a helicopter, however I could hear no sound and the rate of travel was inconsistent with my expectations, thus this posting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have noticed something similar this evening, appearing this time in the south west sky and appearing to be much further away than what I observed last night.   Again, the red/yellow &#39;blinking&#39; and unexpected movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps this is merely light from stars that flew around like firecrackers at the end of their lives thousands of years ago and the light is just reaching us now.<n>
8/8/10 14:00|Morris|IL|Sphere|7 - 10 minutes|3 metalic spheres connected in a triangle in daytime|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78388.html|414|ndxe201008| 3 metalic spheres connected in a triangle in daytime<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the summer, early August 2010, My daughter and I were in our backyard pool enjoying a hot summer day.  We live in Morris, Il, south of the Illinois River in the country.   Our backyard faces to the direct north.  It was approximately 2pm or so and I heard an airplane motor above and to the east. At about a 45degree angle east, southeast, I saw clearly an object best described as 3 large round spheres.  Each appeared very large, about the size or larger that my out building which is 42’ x 36’x18’.  The 3 spheres appeared all connected mechanically and hovered in an upright tri-angle position.   I pointed this object out to my daughter who is 11 years old.  I would of estimated the distance of the object at less that 500 yards horizontally at a height of less that 1000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both were observing it and as I stated earlier I heard the sound of an airplane motor in that general direction.  Beyond this object a airplane was observed traveling in a west, southwest direction and eventually could no longer be heard.  We watched the object for what seemed like minutes and we both noted that no sound could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the object started moving in a direct northerly direction.  As it moved north its elevation increased as did the speed.  Within seconds the object went from a southeast position from our house to due north and disappearing.  It’s acceleration wasn’t instant but the velocity kept increasing to what seemed a unbelievable rate.  I have experience with aircraft and high rate acceleration and can say I’ve never seen this kind of acceleration before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object disappeared I instantly told my daughter, &#34;Don’t say anything yet but draw a picture of what you just saw and I will to.&#34;   We both drew the exact same object on the pool top with our wet fingers.  We both then explained to each other what it was we thought we just saw or observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of all the UFO reports we’ve read about and pictures and drawings we’ve seen on the net, this was the first that I’ve seen or heard about that was described as 3 large spheres connected in a tri-angle shape.   We both told a couple people what we saw that day but of course the look at us like were goofy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I thought I would just pass this along.<n>

The object did not move but emitted three lights at different intervals and in different patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On first sight, red lights did a wave like motion parallel to the ground for about 5 minutes then proceeded to flash red and white lights in a horizontal direction, red and white back and forth for another 5 minutes.  A small greenish light then appeared at the center of the object.  The red and white lights at this time began to flash red horizontally and white vertically in a cross-like pattern.  A brighter light at the top of the object shone onto the top half of the object, it wasn&#39;t metallic or shiny in appearance but was of greyish color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object, after about 15 minutes of remaining in the same position, slowly descended into the sky and continued the blinking and flashing patterns.<n>

The lights were small, like taillights, and as I kept watching them, they would disappear, and then come back on but in a different pattern.   A ball like orb would appear and two more lights, white with a red glow on the outside of them, would come out of the bottom. Sometimes they looked like a diamond shape and other times, round.   After watching them a while, my grandson came home about 11:30 pm and I had him watch them also.  After he went to his house I decided to see if the camera I had would take a picture of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I took the chip from the camera in to be developed I was really surprised the photos came out.

I stopped and observed the object moving 300 to 400 mph in this Northerly direction. I listened for the engine noise thinking it was a jet with the afterburner burning. There was absolutely no engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I saw a second bright orange orb at a distance behind the first estimated at one mile. At this point I went inside and called my wife to come outside and look at what I was seeing and grabbed my camera. Then a third came up toward the second and so on, until there were 10 to 12 objects passing in single file above the horizon, climbing in altitude and all moving at a steady rate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for a total of 15 minutes. It was mostly cloudy at the time we observed the objects, except where we able to see the objects appear. All disappeared into the clouds at the far North, estimated to be ten to fifteen miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time was there any engine noise and all of the objects had the same orange color and dimensions. All were round, bright orange, about the color of a fresh pumpkin. The size was the size of a basketball placed on the floor of a full sized basketball court and observed from the opposite end of the court.<n>

Moments later a commercial aircraft on the normal flight path into Glasgow Airport (Scotland) passed overhead.  Given that the two literally crisscrossed each other, I’d be amazed if the flight crew of the aircraft didn’t see the orange light I saw as it would have been passing left to right from their point of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my vehicle and spoke to another car driver parked outside a shop.

Four different lights, shining like if they were wildfire, appeared soundless, somewhat, over Yakima City (Which was Northeast from my location).  The lights where all in a diagonal line pointing south.  I would say that in about 20 seconds of viewing the lights.  The third light down slowly dimmed, but then to appear first of the line.   All of the lights seemed to shift except for one, the brightest light of the four.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While the lights where shifting, I grabbed my binoculars, mine are not for night vision, and for a split second the object came into light.  I was able to see a triangular shape but without its point at the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That appearance lasted six minutes, the next one was at 11:14 to 11:16 with the duration of two minutes.

Apprx. one minute to traverse the sky.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77102.html|427|ndxe201008| Orange-yellow light at high altitude in Detroit area. Apprx. one minute to traverse the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday evening 8/7/2010 at 2135 hours, my friend and were seated on an outdoor patio in the Detroit area and witnessed an object of indeterminate shape rising from the SW or SSW treeline. The object was a very bright orange-yellow and I at first thought it might have been an aircraft with its landing lights on.  Its magnitude was far brighter than Sirius.  It is difficult to gauge the size of the object but I would estimate it as subtending half the angle as does a light plane at very high altitude. From our vantage point, looking in a NNW direction, the object was at about 45 degrees from the horizon. We heard no sound, saw no trail and watched it trace an arc for about one minute before it dipped below the trees in the NE or NNE. It appeared to have maintained the same level of brightness throughout its trajectory, ruling out any &#34;landing lights&#34;.   At the time I speculated that it could have been a space vehicle during re-entry.  The object seemed far to! o bright to have been reflecting sunlight and the time was 50 minutes past sunset.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called Selfridge ANG base and spoke with a colonel in the Air Museum but he could provide no information; they had no reports of a sighting. I checked the Space Shuttle schedule and ruled out that possibility.  I then contacted our local TV stations and had the same result.  I spoke with our TV weatherman, who seemed very interested but he also had no reports of any such phenomenon.  He checked on the wind direction for the time of the object&#39;s transit but the high altitude winds were in a direction almost opposite that which would account for a weather balloon as an explanation.<n>

The lights also appeared to be over the water.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights flickered, appearing to look like distant campfires or other flames.  (Maybe they were flares?)  I was walking east towards the ocean, and was passing the firehouse when several people out front had already noticed the lights and were discussing what they could be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I have seen these lights.  I never bothered to comment on them, as I thought they had to be from military aircraft due to Dover Air Force Base being nearby.  However, I am seeing them more and more.  In fact, my friend and I joke about them, and when we see them we comment, &#34;Our friend is back.&#34;<n>

Our son walks in from out side and said there is fire in the sky. I told him the neighbors were setting off fireworks over the lake. He said no. It’s not fireworks.  I walked out and saw the object in the air and was trying to come up with an answer for this.  A balloon, Blimp but as it got closer I saw a distinctive triangle with different colored lights. Red, Blue Yellow, and a little green.  But as it got closer I noticed that it was not only the triangle that the lights were lit.  But tiny little lines, not many but definitive lines of dimmer lights that were in the middle of the triangle. I called my wife to see and to get the camera.  We started to take pictures of the craft. And soon as the flashes of the camera were going off it seemed to move slowly in the opposite direction  north northeast.  Then went slowly upward into the clouds and now just blue lights were showing through the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can send the pictures if requested.

8/7/10 20:00|Peebles|OH|Circle||round object with much smaller attached object circling the main object in vertical motion|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77108.html|434|ndxe201008| round object with much smaller attached object circling the main object in vertical motion<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a casual amateur astronomer with some working knowledge of the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just begun an evening of stargazing in rural southern Ohio and was planning to start with sightings of Venus, Saturn, and Mars, which were grouped quite close together just after sunset on 8-7-10.  I noticed the object in question while waiting for Venus to appear after sunset.  In terms of brightness it looked a lot like Venus, but it was way too high in the sky to be that planet, and its brightness was probably closer to that of Jupiter, which was not due to appear until much later in the evening.  I thought perhaps it was a very bright star but did not know what star it might be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To attempt to identify the object, I trained my 6-inch Dobsonian with low magnification on the object.  What I saw was a disc, but not a disc in the sense of a flying saucer type object seen edge-on.  Rather, it was perfectly round and about the size of Jupiter on high magnification.  It appeared to have some markings on it somewhat similar to the light and dark areas seen on Mars when that planet is relatively close to Earth.  It did not appear to be moving at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I observed the object, I noticed it had a much smaller object which appeared to be circling it, much as you might see the Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter.  But the circling was not horizontal like a natural satellite --- east-west or west-east --- but rather a vertical polar orbit.  As I watched, the smaller object moved from about the 7:00 o&#39;clock position on the main object up to the very top 12:00 o&#39;clock position.  What was even weirder was that the smaller object appeared to be attached to the main object by a line which was very thin but quite visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this happened very quickly, in a matter of a few seconds, and after this brief observation I was mystified as to what the object might be.  I thought perhaps it might be some exotic satellite of which I was unaware.  I took my eye from the telescope so I could just look at it to see if it was moving across the sky in a straight line at a steady rate with a steady brightness the way satellites do.  But when I looked up it had vanished.  Satellites wink out when they enter the earth&#39;s shadow and are no longer illuminated by the sun.  But as far as I could tell this object was not moving at all.  Had it been moving I would have almost certainly noticed some movement of the main object when I was looking at it through the telescope, since magnification also magnifies the perceived motion of an object across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything like this and I am at a loss as to what this object might have been.  I was sober with my faculties intact when I observed it. {:&gt;) If anyone has seen something similar or knows what it may have been I would be interested in some feedback.<n>

At 3:20 pm I purchased ice cream for my daughter at the Glen Echo Café and then after walking around, maybe for 10 minutes we sat at a park bench facing the main building area.  My son was with me as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up at the sky and saw something that appeared round remaining in the same spot.  It was high above the clouds.  I heard a helicopter near by and also saw a plane.  I looked again to see if it was a helicopter but realized that it was too high for me to hear any sound from it.  I remained seated with my kids but chatted with them taking my eyes off what I had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes I thought I would take another look and sure enough it was in the same spot.  Not knowing what it was-it did look like an unusual speck-I grabbed my camera and took a picture of the sky where I saw it thinking I just might be able to magnify the picture and see it better later at home.  Three minutes later, I zoomed in and took another picture.  I also did a short video clip with a description of what we were looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My children did not see it at first but I brought it to their attention by directing them to look in an area in between and above two red turrets and then to follow up the sky to the last cloud.  They did locate it at that point.  I would have to say we were there for at least 10 minutes and it had remained in the same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home, I was convinced I got nothing but then when I pulled up the picture, I located the spot in the picture and with interest magnified it.  It turned out to be what looked like a metallic sphere reflecting the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am sending a Google Earth picture of the area showing exactly where we were sitting.  I am also including the clearest snap shot with magnification.  On the original picture with the cloud, you cannot see the spot too easily but once you locate it and magnify it, you can view the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way to find it is to look at the cloud, move your eyes to the part on the bottom that resembles the map of Italy.  From there look to the right and once you reach the far right side of the cloud, you will see a tiny dot-don’t ask me why I even noticed it on such a bright day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it was-a weather balloon?-but as shown by the pictures I took, it had not moved in the space of three minutes.  I just wonder if any one else in our area saw this thing.<n>

Now this original sighting and movement lasted 15-20 seconds and the speed was constant as it changed colors but it suddenly made a 90 degree turn straight down and the color faded from orange to red.  The speed was the same during and after the direction change.  The lite totally stopped  moving 3-4 seconds after the change of direction and just stood still hanging in the sky,it remained that way for another 4 minutes and then it pulsed it lite and faded away.

The lights were initially low behind the tree line and observed through the trees.  After about 20 minutes the flickering light rose above tree line into a clearing and there it appeared more like a super bright white star. The light floated side to side up and down and gradually worked more southern but worked a range north to south while gradually fading west.  It was visible for at least an hour.  Sometimes moving down and disapearing for 5 minute and then returning.  During the last 10 minutes of watching, a second bright star like floating object jetted toward the original and then quickly shot north west like a shooting star in speed.  The original object was slow and bounced in the sky much like someone moving a flashlight across a ceiling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We checked for reflections. The window was open on our home and there were no reflections. There was no noise and the sky was clear. Normal star patterns were seen in the sky that were not moving. The object was not moving fast enough to be helicopter nor airplane.  We watched from the blackness of our open bedroom window until the object seemed to fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was star like in appearance but brighter and resembled a bright white round ball that had occasional bright white beams flickering like a super shiney flickering diamond.

There is a round driveway and we dropped off my grandmother and as we were rounding the driveway we saw something overhead and stopped.  An extremely large, low flying aircraft flew over the top of the other building and then took a sudden turn and took off so quickly in disappeared in just a second.  The shape of the aircraft was triangular with one of the points appearing to be the front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was very dark outside, it was hard to make out the color of the aircraft, but we did observe that it had a light on each corner.  It was flying extremely low to the ground (right above the treetops) and from what I remember, made absolutely no noise.  It was also extremely large, and although it is hard to estimate the size, it was definitely larger than our car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards we both looked at each other in absolute shock and tried to figure out what we saw.  We both concluded any other aircraf! t that we are familiar with would make some noise, and wouldn’t be flying so low.  We couldn’t find a plausible explanation for the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I heard a small plane engine. As I stood up in the shallow part of the pool I observed it to be a low flying small plane flying east.  As it passed directly over the pool I saw a silver cigar shape almost intersect the low flying small plane at a much higher altitude heading north.  It was heading due north making no sound and showing no vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of the pool to look at it from a different angle looking for wings I saw no wings it continued north for about another 30 seconds before disappearing into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole episode lasted no more than a minute or two. Afterwards I came inside and hand wrote a statement including the date and time. Later I thought about it and decided to report it.<n>

LOOK&#39;S LIKE A BB &amp; NO MOVEMENT<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in a hospital room with my brother who had just had a knee surgury he lied next to me as I sat next to the window it was vary cloudy out and the cloud&#39;s hung low and we where haveing alot of rain.   I was just looking at the cloud&#39;s and noticed that their was like a port whole through the cloud&#39;s that you could see up to the next level of cloud&#39;s the lower one I figured where at about 30,000 feet and where high enough that comercial plain&#39;s were flying under them as in the hospital you could see Anchorage International Airport of to the south west directly next to the hospital in Maril field private airfield and just north is Elmendorf Airforce Base wich you can see all from the 6 th. floor of the hospital room we were in . I just left work and showed up in his room had not been their 15 minute&#39;s when I spoted the ball or bb I called it as it was so high that you could only refure to it as a bb it was at about 60,000 to 80,000 feet up as the aircraft I ! seen flying had wingspan&#39;s of 200 feet at least as one plain flew by was 737 and another was a military transport both flew under the cloud mass and they appeared to have a wingspan of a 1&#34; to 1 1/2 &#34; span at the hight I seen them not sure if this is a good way of showing the size or not but the bb was two to three times the hight of the passing by aircraft and appeared to be just a attimate object that did not move the whole time I watched it and I told my brother man their is a UFO out their and I got to find some one show it to and I looked out the coridor to see if their was a nurse or doctor to show what I was witnessing and no one was in sight and at a minute of viewing this object since it didnt move all that time I figured I would go down the hall way and find some one wich I did and when I returned with a witness it was gone . I only wish I had stayed but all my life I never seen nothing I could not explain and this thing sat at that hight and didnt move . This was! daylight and heavy cloud cover and if it wernt for the portho! le and t he object to be sitting in the middle of the blue clear spot you would not of ever spoted it . It was like they were useing the port hole to spy or at least be able to down through it their was no other porthole&#39;s or any other blue sky showing any where so that is the only reason I spoted it .<n>

As i watched the plane I noticed a glint of light coming from behind the plane.  At first I thought it might be another plane. I looked directly at the object and noticed it was a triangle shape, moving extremely fast. In a matter of 2 or 3 seconds it went from being about 1.5 miles behind the plane to 2 miles in front of the plane.  I could hear the sound of the planes engines as it went by my location. I heard nothing as the craft accelerated to pass the plane.  As I reached for my phone to take a picture this craft went vertical and accelerated to over 1000 miles per hour.  Both plane and craft were at about 10,000 feet when seen. As the craft went vertical it was out of my sight in a second.<n>

8/6/10 14:40|Peabody|MA|Disk|10 seconds|Silver disk flew over my backyard, directly overhead, low and slow.|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77141.html|454|ndxe201008| Silver disk flew over my backyard, directly overhead, low and slow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the afternoon of August 6, 2010, I was on a lounge chair in my backyard on the north side of the swimming pool. It was 2:40 pm on a sunny day with a mostly blue sky dotted with a few puffy clouds.  I was facing east and was in the shade cast by the tall bamboo behind me.  Although there was no change in the light, I had a random thought that dark thunderclouds might be coming in from the west and looked up at the sky.  A few seconds later I saw a silver disk travelling from west to east, in a straight line over my pool almost directly overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance I thought it was some kid&#39;s silver balloon that got loose but quickly realized it was no floppy, tinfoil balloon, but some kind of solid, firm-surfaced metal. I focused in on it so I could remember as much detail as possible. It was shaped like a disk but also had a squashed circle/egg type shape. The top and bottom were rounded and the sides were slightly rounded, like the shape of a Mento candy. There were no hard edges or seams, no puckers or variations of color or texture in the surface. It was totally smooth and reflective, the bottom of it turning darker as it passed over the green trees at the eastern end of the yard. I&#39;m estimating that it was about 30 feet above the fully mature maple trees, so maybe 60 feet above ground. I got the impression that it might be 3 to 4 feet in diameter. Although it was breezy at the treetops, the disk moved in a straight line, with no side to side wavering or drifting from the wind, and no change in altitude. There! was absolutely no sound emitting from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the disk had been in my sight for about 5 seconds I had the presence of mind to call out, &#34;Look up!&#34; to my husband, who was doing some yard work about 20 feet behind me and to the right. Since he was to the right of the edge of the bamboo stand he had a clear view of the disk and looked up in time to see it just as it was going over the trees. His description of the disk corroborated mine. From the time I saw the disk to the time it travelled out of sight was about 8 to 10 seconds and I estimate that the distance it travelled in that time was about 50 to 60 feet. Using these estimates, the disk was travelling at about 3 to 5 miles per hour. Unfortunately there was no time to take a picture, even with my cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am recently retired but was a government employee for 33 years and my husband works for a major airline. Our eyesight is fine and neither of us requires eyeglasses or contacts for driving. Immediately following this sighting I felt satisfied to have finally seen something concrete and real because it left no doubt that these objects do exist. Then I started wondering whether the fact that they do exist was a good thing or not. Knowing that there is technology far advanced than that held by us here on Earth is a bit unsettling. From our own history we know what usually happens when a technologically advanced civilization meets a less advanced society. I can only hope that whoever is controlling these objects has a less aggressive nature than us humans.  I am not overly worried about it, though, because I feel that if they meant to do us harm, they would have by now.  Perhaps they are just documenting our own self-destruction, via the proliferation of nuclear weapons, p! ollution, greenhouse gases, over population, genocide, chemical farming, antibiotics, destruction of the rainforests, and over fishing?  Maybe we are their version of watching a demolition derby; dirty, ugly and violent, but oh so entertaining!  We told friends about the sighting but, of course, most of them just laughed it off and asked how much we had been drinking at the time (which, by the way, was not at all). We humans do laugh when we are nervous about something, and we don&#39;t want to hear about something that makes us uncomfortable. And the quickest way to shut someone up is to ridicule them. So our friends reactions are normal, but we know what we saw. I don&#39;t think our government could keep such technology a secret. Even if they could, if we had it, we wouldn&#39;t be fighting wars to get oil because we would have a better propulsion system already. So what we saw was an Object, that was Flying and is Unidentified...a UFO.<n>

The sky was so clear that you could see the stars in the sky.  My friend and I were outside on the deck talking (our husbands were there as well) and we both looked up and saw something flying in the sky just above the trees.  The object was flying quite fast.  It flew across the sky and we followed it with our eyes for about 10 seconds and then it disappeared right before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right after it happened, we talked about it and both described the same thing that we saw and heard flying in the sky.  We both saw this object that had two circular lights perpendicular to each other.  The lights were not bright, they were almost like a very faint colored light.  We also both heard a humming sound as well, it almost sounded like a machine (something that we both never heard before).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very strange object that we’ve both never seen before and we both decided that it definitely wasn’t a plane because first o! f all, it didn’t sound like a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Second of all, no plane that we’ve ever seen had lights that close together.  Although our husbands didn&#39;t see it or hear it, my friend and I decided that it was an UFO.  We were also talking about that night and my friend, husband and I all said that we felt as though the time frame of that evening were a little strange.  My husband said he looked at the clock at about 2230 hrs and then before he knew it, it was already 0130 hrs.  I also said that I looked at the clock at 2300 hrs and then the next time I looked it was 0130 hrs.  My friend said she looked at the clock at 0015 hrs and before she knew it, it was 0130 hrs.

The lights were about the size the size of stars in the sky, they were clearly not stars due to their color and movement.  From where I stood the figure was smaller than the side of the moon, but larger than a commercial airplane in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The figure appeared to be slowly hovering, moving from the east to the west.  I watch it until it seemed to glimmer out of sight, as if it were slipping behind a cloud. I didn’t hear any sounds. The sky, however, was clear that night. After the object disappeared I went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About an hour later I went back outside onto my porch and looking in the direction of where I had last seen the figure in the sky.

When it all of a sudden be came bigger and really bright.  Then another dimer light split away from it and became as bright as the first one was. It seem to fly towards me and the it was gone.  Two more split away from the original one headed north th other south. They stayed on that heading till the one going north disappeared I looked and one heading south when it zipped across the sky like a shooting star and made a complete stop. It was now where the one going north was, if I had blinked I would have missed it.  Then flew to the northwest till it was out of site. Now the orginal is still in same spot just hovering.  I had decided to pull over to watch, but before that happened I noticed three more lights in a trian! gle around the big one.  They small and very dimm . Soon they were a bright as the first one.  I pull over, on another road and got out of the truck.  Two of them where gone by the time I got out and the other was seem to fade away.  The original like still has not moved I got out camera and tried to take a photo.  I forgot to turn flash off so when took a pic the camera flashed.  That is when it dimmed  started moving to the north.  I got back in the truck and got back on the road light followed right besided me all the to Tunica.

I was sky gazing trying to see if there was any of the sun “tsunami” flare visible in the northern sky.  I didn’t see anything then turned to look at South sky.  I didn’t hear any helicopters, or other aircraft in the sky.  It was a very clear night, maybe some smoke in air from wildfires, no moon visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ages Female 49, Female 16. I am disabled Law Enforcement, have been both Dispatcher and Officer. Family has Law Enforcement background  I saw a light moving from East to West about mid sky, the silver light stopped and began moving in a zig zag motion then a spiral within an area of sky that could be covered by a 50 cent piece held at arms length. The light wasn’t as bright as Jupiter but not as dim as a satellite moving in the sky. I yelled for my Great Niece to come out and see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there for 15 minutes watching the light. It would move in spirals, zigzag, and linear, then would appear to remain in one spot with a quiver to it. The light stayed constant in intensity never changing its brightness. I flashed my LED flashlight at it to see if any response but it did nothing, I don’t think my light could have been visible from any distance anyway. We thought of getting a camera to take a picture but our zoom isn’t strong enough and too dark for it to pick out any detail of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before going to bed at 0010hrs 080610, I went back out to see if light was still visible, it was still in the sky still doing its spirals and odd movements. Still couldn’t hear any aircraft that may have been in the area. Even the wildlife we have Owls, bears, and coyotes were quiet no real background noises other then from the open windows of house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was silver blue no real shape possible diamond, then possibly round. Was hard to tell when it &#34;quivered.&#34;  Just appeared to be a light that did not change its intensity. Was much brighter then the satellite that moved to its East from North to South that was barely visible to us. It was not as bright as Jupiter. The area of sky that it was in was in the Milky Way, in that band of bright stars. It was mid sky from the southern ridge of mountains to &#34;noon&#34; above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she struck us as being an unusually capable, level-headed witness.

I have seen quite a few shooting stars before but never anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking toward the south direction and noticed it moving very rapidly towards the north-east direction, moving across the center of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was as high as the stars and the size of a star with a consistent orangish color. It moved from one side of the sky to the other in less than 3 minutes!  I was watching it move through the sky, but it moved too far too fast for my eyes to focus on it traveling away from me(I have excellent vision).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, I stayed outside for a while longer, looking up, and saw airplanes flying by and compared the object I saw to airplanes.

It stayed in position about 1.5 minutes and then accelerated quickly straight up and disappeared in about 15 seconds from the point of acceleration.  A second light then appeared, taking relatively the same position as the first, and again hovered for about 1.5 minutes and then accelerated upwards along the same trajectory as the first and again disappeared out of sight into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light we observed was a light yellow / orange.  We could not see any sort of craft, just this illumination.  We speculated that perhaps it was an object carrying a fire of some sort, or a &#34;lantern&#34;.  However, to see it as we did, my husband noted it would have to be a fire of great size to illuminate over the distance.  As well, it was not flickering, and it was a focused bright light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Space station moves and this was stationary.  The angle was looking almost at 60 degrees in the sky from my position to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could it have been a star visible during the day time?

Observed from South San Jose.  The angle in the sky was somewhat shallow, at 20-30 degrees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First object was a small white dot travelling at high rate of speed to the south toward Gilroy.  It could have made the trip from San Jose to Gilroy in 10 to 20 seconds which would make this speed ±6,000 to ±12,000 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute or so later, I see what appears to be same object at lower altitude this time (maybe 30,000 feet) travel north along foothills.  Same speed.  Observed both objects for about 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Too fast to be a plane.  Highly doubt this was a bird as it was so far away and traveling so fast.

The lights however were not getting any closer, more of a hover than movement...I saw one extremely bright white light and red and green lights on the side..the light than split into two separate lights, still remaining in a hover type position.  The two lights moved slowly to the west.  NOt getting any further away from the other white light.  I watched as the lights on both craft became brighter than as quickly as I had seen the lights they were gone.  I witnessed this alone.  The lights were at an attitude that would have indicated to me it was a plane.  Ones that fly over a city more than are heading into a city.<n>

I am 26 years old and a mother of four, i am married. I went to bed around 11 o&#39;clock at night.  My aunt which lives with me, who is 39 years old witnessed it first and woke me up to observe it also. She didn&#39;t believe what it was she was seeing. I woke up and walked over to my front door and watched it through the screen door from inside my living room.  I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes...I was in complete shock. I have never seen anything like this before, I also never witnessed ghost&#39;s either we are not big fans of the paranormal. But .....this is crazy....it was round and bright and had a variety of different colors.  Very very bright colors. A mixture of them.  It was red, green, blue, yellow and others also. It moved very rapidly... that is what scared me....if from here it moved very fast as a blink of an eye imagine how fast it really moved up there... it would move from left to right, right to left and slow! ly in a circle movement up and down.  Then after a while I noticed there were four more smaller ones to the left of it they were all lined up side by side....you couldn&#39;t see those as clear as the biggest one we seen first.  Eventually it started to move farther and farther away due to the size of it, it was appearing smaller.  The other four stayed in it&#39;s places but the big one did appear be moving farther away.  We came inside and talked about it. We are still amazed about what we saw.<n>

In shape it was somewhat like a spade from a deck of cards but less round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing to come to mind was a phoenix, it was glowing very bright yellow and was flowy like feathers.  It was relatively small about 5 feet wide and 3 feet long.  It remained in that spot in my line of sight for a few seconds, then it simply vanished after turning pale in color, almost white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that happened for the rest of the way home,(just about 3.5 more miles), in the sky there were what appeared to be shooting stars going different random directions through the sky.  I saw approx. 10 of these before they stopped completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This experience was the first I&#39;ve had in Oklahoma since my son and my fiance moved here from Maryland about 5 months ago.

Since we are in the flight path of the Greater Cincinnati – Northern Kentucky Airport we thought these were smaller aircraft or helicopters judging from their speed which was slower than jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two objects were amber to almost orange in color and very easy to see. The size I would say was 3 – 4 times bigger than the planet Venus which is now prominent in the night skies. These 2 objects appeared to be at the same altitude but we could tell there were two separate objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they got closer to us, they appeared to slow down. There was no sound coming from these objects which really got us wondering what these were. The objects stopped moving completely for about 5 to 10 seconds then they both started moving slowly upward and we watched them disappear into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather conditions were windy because thunderstorms were in the area. Some low clouds were passing by but visibility was good. We are located about 15 miles west of Cincinnati near the Indiana border.<n>

We were walking by the lake in a suburbian setting and noticed a semi-translucent beam of green light coming straight down from the clouds, stationary and flashing on and off on a cycle of about 3 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beam was too wide (6 inches perhaps) to be a joker with a lazer, and anyway it could be seen in front of the houses at a point on the ground.  There was no sound of a helicopter or any other craft.  We have often seen police helicopters over the district with their white searchlights, quite different from this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, their engines make a loud noise overhead.  I was with my gran, who is very sceptical about such things, but she was frightened by this, and wanted to get away.  She described the clouds as having a strange two-dimensional appearance, with the one emitting the beam being dome-shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The beam went off suddenly and nothing occurred since.  My gran is very straight-laced, so to see her so affected is a measure of the strangeness of the event.<n>

At the same time, a two engine, wide body commerial jet (flying out of Toronto International airport) came into the vicinity of the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Next the object turned on, what seemed to me to be dark yellow landing lights.

Our family friend had told us all the flights were delayed or canceled  because of the thunder storm and severe rain we were having.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we were standing outside his house in the drive way he saw a really bright light. He said, &#34;Come here and look at this.&#34;  I was standing where tree branches were blocking my view so I couldn’t see what he was pointing at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stepped closer to where he was standing and looked into the night sky I saw a bright hovering disk (it had a disk like shape but the light surrounding it was rectangle).  It was very bright and looked far away, yet the whole craft was brilliantly lit. It emitted a yellow/golden light in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both stood looking at the flying object until it flew straight into the clouds.  During the short amount of time we saw the UFO, it maintained the hovering position, not moving anywhere, for about 5 seconds.  Then went up a few feet in the air (from our perspective) and back down to the original position.   After this the UFO flew straight up into the clouds at a super fast speed.  It looked like it disappeared. There were no more lights emitting from the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my first encounter with anything to do with UFO’s or aliens. I can’t explain what I saw. I don&#39;t know of any kind of aircraft so bright, has the same shape, can maintain a hover thousands of feet in the air, go at a fast speed straight up and all this during a thunder storm.<n>

But what i found the craziest was the feeling in my gut and back and legs, i felt vibrations internally i cannot begin to describe the feeling! Anyway this thing is maybe 100-150 yards above the corn field and steadily heading DIRECTLY over our heads we both look up in amazement and hold each others hands...the whole time my 3 yr old daughter standing in the doorway watching...<n> <n><n> <n><n> As these lights moved closer, We both knew it wasn&#39;t a vehicle of any sort that we have seen before. Brightest lights at it&#39;s point of direction , with a tiny blue light one either sides of the lead point and the eerie glow of the two corners that had lights but weren&#39;t as piercing as its head point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was obviously triangle the background being illuminated by cloud 2 cloud lightning, this was a steadily approaching triangular craft that had 4-5 lights in the center that were illuminated in different grades of firey RED, it didn&#39;t spin at all like always imagined...so after it flew directly above our heads we ran out the other side of our place to watch it leave, it left as it came silent, and steady…<n>

That evening we were driving on our way back to Volcano Village roughly eighty miles or so away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The traffic was very light and it had been dark for a while now. We had driven through patches of heavy rain but it had cleared and we rolled down the windows to enjoy the clean air. She could see the massive star field clearly out the side window and so could I, in Santa Monica there is too much city light and you only get to see a few stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I had been talking casually for awhile about what activities were to come since we had a couple more days to enjoy. Then, she said &#34;Wait, what&#39;s that?&#34; I said &#34;What?&#34; &#34;In the sky, in front of us, as big as my hand, it was triangular, a flash of lights, in rows.&#34;  I felt that maybe this was just some refection off of the windshield, maybe when i switched from low beams to high so I tried that but that wasn&#39;t it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then she saw it again. This time there was fear in her voice as it was wavering in tone, and that got my attention, we have been married for ten years and I know her well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I now was shifting my line of sight from the road ahead to the sky and back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And for the briefest moment, as if seeing traces of light from lamps that were just switching off, I saw it too. They seemed to be yellow in color, and in rows, dotting the triangular shape,  the shape seemed longer at one end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after, I asked her to grab my TX-1 video camera, because if this thing comes back I want to be ready. And she too got her camera and was at the ready watching the night sky. But it did not come back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we arrived at the house in Volcano, I asked her to draw something of what she had seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I confirmed the shape too. Except it was with the front point facing down instead of up when I saw it. There was also a sort of criss-crossing frame between the lights that you could just make out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the following days what we had seen kept popping up in our conversations. It was a very strange event and I don&#39;t think we will ever forget it.<n>

Waianae bound. My children ages 8 &amp; 12 noticed two bright lights while looking into the sky towards Diamond Head over the empty farm land. We witnessed one-white light moving VERY fast through the sky going straight up into the air, then curved around to change direction. A Red light in the near distance caught up with it and they moved together VERY quickly as if they were playing chase. Movements were circular when trying to change directions. The two lights then took off in back of our view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Observing Venus, Saturn, Mars triangle formation to the east when I looked directly overhead and saw 5 small lights (slightly more luminous than the stars) in rectangle formation moving to the east. I thought...&#34;What the hell kind of plane is that?&#34;.....when they suddenly broke formation, moved around one another for a quick second, like they were jockeying for position, and formed a triangle.  They jockeyed again to form a circle, back to a triangle, a straight line North to South, back to a triangle.....all while travelling East. Approx. 20 sec from when I first saw them...they had moved out of eye view. No sound at all. Best guesstimate of alltitude....possibly ISS alltitude or less.<n>

I didnt think much of it at first really, perhaps a reflection onto the glass of the door.  So I opened the door up and looked beyond the glass and I could still see it. Again, it was just a point of light, something akin to a star.  But a storm had just been through, and there was solid cloudcover overhead, lightening still flashing about.  As I watched the light, it seemed to shift from side to side very slightly every 30 seconds or so. In addition to its movements, there was a &#39;pulse&#39; of light around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thats the best I can word what happened.  There was the central point of white light, and in a very minute &#39;aura&#39; like section around it, there was a pulsing light ring that shifted from red, to blue, to white, and through that cycle fairly quickly. (2-3 seconds per color shift)<n>

We were looking for the Northern Lights, as they were forecast to be visible. Object appeared on the Northern edge of the horizon as a small round light.  It traveled in a N to S direction, very high in the sky.  It did NOT blink, have any colored lights or appear to change shape. It moved so quickly that it went from the Northern Horizon to the Southern horizon in less than 40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I am NOT a UFO buff, I have spent many nights outside watching the sky for various reasons.  To pass the time, star gaze etc. and even count the amount of airplanes in the sky.  I am 45 years old and a stable individual with a clean mental history.  I know how to identify an airplane, as I have observed many planes in the air.  Whatever this object was? it was FAST, very, VERY FAST!  In the section of sky I could view, it would take a normal airplane at LEAST 7 to 11 minutes to cover the same distance.<n>

About 200 feet ahead of me, on the east side|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76984.html|495|ndxe201008| I was travelling south on u.s.  41, about ten or 15 miles outside of Terre Haute, Indiana. About 200 feet ahead of me, on the east side of the highway, I notice some lights moving in the sky heading west. I thought nothing of it.  Thought it was a low flying airplane.  As I got closer, I noticed that these lights were REALLY low in the sky.  About 100-150 ft. In the air.  There were three perfectly round  lights.  At least 5 times the size of regular car headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights did not flash,  the two end lights were green and a red light in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a white spotlight that appeared to come from above the other three lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The spotlight shined a cone of light in front of  it. The colored lights were evenly spaced apart. About as wide as a sedan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I passed underneath these lights I stuck my head out of the car window trying to figure out what this thing was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving slowly, and silently almost like it was floating across the highway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t see wings, or even any kind of depth or shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared the lights were connected by a string and all moving together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen planes landing in day and night,  even at night , I could always tell it was a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was no plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were three cars ahead of me and I know they saw this too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It completely freaked me out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called a buddy and described what I saw,  he asked had I been smoking crack.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t believe in aliens. So this must have been a drone or experimental craft.<n>
8/3/10 21:05|Naval weapons base Fallbrook|CA|Oval|4minutes|Elongated object with 7 white lights|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76977.html|496|ndxe201008| Elongated object with 7 white lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving through Naval Weapons Base Fallbrook, Ca, at 2105 heading North East towards the city of Fallbrook  I noticed up ahead on my left side in the pasture 5 white lights that where to high up to be anything on the ground.  Being that I work with aircraft I noticed no red or green lights to distinguish port or starboard side of an aircraft.  I thought to myself it is just a few lights in the distance nothing to worry about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing the lights I continued to drive my motorcycle towards Fallbrook. Up and to my right I spotted what I thought to be a deer.  The deer jumped the fence on the right side of the road and landed between me and the vehicle that was approxametly 20 feet in front of me. After landing in between myself and the vehicle in front of me it sprinted to the left side of the road almost being hit by a vehicle going south east towards Camp Pendleton then disappeared.  The animal that to me seabed to be a 4 legged animal that resembled a deer, but was shorter in the back legs than the front and more of a black color than a deer would be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the animal or thing ran across road I noticed the lights where no longer on my right but where now on my left side. The closer I got towards the lights it became more obvious in shape to me. The shape best I can describe was oblong like a football, but more elongated.  I counted 5 white lights that where going down the length of the object and 2 more white lights.  One being towards the top of the object an the other towards the bottom of the object both going in slow steady circles around the object and disappearing when going to the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Continuing to drive I watched the object on my bike till I could no longer see it without having to turn around on my bike. I then tried looking in my mirrors to try and see the object.  I was not able to spot anything in my mirror so I turned and looked on my bike to see if the object was still there.  Having turned around I noticed the object had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing what I saw I continued to drive through base. After exiting the base I along with the car in front of me an behind me stopped at the red light.  The car behind me drove up beside me and asked me if I had seen what he had saw. I proceeded to tell him and he said that&#39;s exactly what he had seen as well.  After talking with that person I pulled my bike up towards the vehicle in front of me.  Both the driver and passenger of that vehicle told me they seen the exact same thing.<n>

I am quite accustomed to seeing satelites, shooting stars and assorted aircraft, but last night was different.  I live outside of town and am very secluded.  The nights are gorgeous since there is no light polution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat outside for about half an hour and was able to track several satelites.  I had just finished tracking my last satelite, watching it disappear above me over my house.  I immediately dropped my eyes back down to the horizon, looking southeast.  There is a large hill in front of where I live and it is covered in small pine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly above the treeline appeared what I first thought was a star.  It hadn&#39;t been there a minute before.  It shown intensely bright, and I could not figure out what star, at that intense a magnitude, would be coming up in that place at that time.  It was way brighter than anything else in the sky.  I continued to think it was a very! bright star when I suddenly realized it was moving very, very slowly.  Then I got excited and thought perhaps I was looking at the ISS.  I have no idea how high it was, and there was no noise connected to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for about a minute as it traveled about the length of my hand - if I were to extend my arm.  It suddenly stopped, unlike anything I have ever seen.  It hung motionless and grew even more intense in its brightness, and then began to slowly dim until it became just a pin point of light, and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only way I can describe the object is that of a very bright, white light - like a huge star.  I have never seen anything act that way.  I would be curious to know if anyone else saw the same thing.<n>

I asked my friend to look and see if he could tell what it was.  My friend worked for air Canada for 28 years and had never seen anything that he could say what it was.  We sat with our wives and watched for about 6 minutes as it speed across the sky and then disappeared..  We were all in disbelief and shocked as we sat for another 10 minutes and suddenly from the same area a second orange orb appeared shot across the sky and then disappeared as well<n>

It only makes this sound when a cell phone is around it.  So I got up to get my cell phone and it was turned off so I got back on the bed when I turn my head to the window and it was round with like 20 to 30 lights around it.  My girlfriend rose up to me screaming “look out the window you see that” so I ran outside to see a better close up and there it was in a distance but this time it was only a bright light instead of a lot of them.  Me and my girlfriend and her dad were outside watching it for about 10 seconds and then it was gone.  It made a humming nose and I never seen an aircraft like this.  Believe or not.<n>

It stopped and it was hard to tell trajectory but I could swear it was coming right for us (Earth)   Stopped and went off to the side roughly an eight from right above to horizon.  Then stopped again and zoomed off. It was hard to tell size but judging from sight I’d say at least the size of America but probably way bigger than the moon.

I turned the corner and had a clear view of the sky and saw a HUGE triangle shaped object moving very slowly and sort of angling down.  It was so huge I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing.  I should have pulled over but continued down the road and then turned around and went back with the intention of pulling over to watch it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned, the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I drove a little while and could not find it again.  I wish I had thought to get my phone and take a picture of it.  It was flying low and moving slow.<n>

It wasn&#39;t until the next day that I noticed in 2 of the pictures that there was an object in roughly the same area of the sky, but these pictures were not sequential.

There is a very small, blurry, light-colored object, approximately 1/4 or 1/3 (est.) the diameter of the rising sun.  It could be a clump of cloud, an aircraft, we believe.  If it is a genuine UFO, we cannot confirm that fact, based on the information provided by the witness.  PD))<n>

As they reached approximately 75 degrees above us, the spheres broke formation and lights faded out as they separated and moved away.  Top sphere broke to the east, trailing two broke to the west and faded as they continued turn toward south. I did not observe the eastbound sphere after the break.  Spheres were orange in color with no other lights visible.  No sounds were heard.  The sky was clear, stars were visible, and the moon had not yet risen.<n>

It was after dark and I observed an orange glowing sphere moving across the sky moving in a straight path sloping downward at about 30 degrees lower than horizontal from right to left.  The degree of luminescence was a little less than the moon on other nights. It was a soft, ember-like glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size, while impossible to judge due to no reference objects or clear idea of how far away it was, affected my field of vision in a similar way that a very large plane would have had at about a mile or two away flying at 500 knots.  At first I thought it was a plane, in fact. It had no blinking lights of any kind and was just a glowing sphere.  The straight line path suddenly and abruptly bent into a new straight line path at about 30 degrees more upward than it was, but it still went down towards the horizon until behind trees that blocked my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunatley, I didn&#39;t think of reporting it or know where to.

I watched for about a minute, went into the house to get a video camera and as I returned outside the objects were dissapearing in mid air one by one from the right side.  A little after that, we saw an  object that looked like an airplane going toward the cape cod canal from where we are and there were two or three of the unknown objects to the right of the supposed airplane.

I was looking in the direction that the flash appeared to originate from, in the southwest portion of the sky near Douglas Park, (a new commercial and housing development near the Long Beach Airport) and saw a vibrant but undiscernible arc or point of green light low in the sky, slightly above the rooftop level of a house across the street. One friend of mine, who was facing the other direction, also saw the flash but observed that it lower in intensity and appeared to have come from behind him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several friends of mine living in an area in the general direction of the flash--in the Lakewood Country Club--reported having lost power at the time, several minutes later via facebook. The flash event lasted only a brief second, and neither I nor my companions heard any sort of noise in the seconds following the anomaly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect that the flash was caused by a copper or thallium-containing iron meteorite, which would explain the green color of the flash, the lack of accompanying sound, and EMP which knocked out power.  I am an entering college student with an above-average scientific background.  I wrote this report to provide a coherent, detailed explanation of the event that occurred in anticipation that other reports would be made.<n>

We were fishing facing the south direction.  My brother in law said, &#34;Hey man, I just saw 2 shooting stars.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately he said, &#34;Dude, what the hell is that.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned and looked in a south facing direction and my eyes locked on a bright orange glowing object.  It appeared to be in a triangle with a flat shaped nose.  The visibility last night was unlimited.  There were clouds to the east of our location and the object was definitely below the cloud height.  The object was glowing the entire time as it moved across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate the height of the object to be about 1200 feet off the ground.  It moved very fast, steady and very smooth as it flew across the sky.  It was absolutely 100% not an airplane.  Being in the Air Force for almost 11 years I have seen my fair share of aircraft and this was most certainly not one.  It made absolutely no sound.  I would estimate the object to be about 2 1/2 miles away from where we were.  The sighting lasted approx 25 seconds.  From the time I first viewed the object to the time I could no longer see it had moved about 110 degrees across the sky east to west.  The object was moving in a west direction down the shore line of Oahu.  We were right beside the airport when this happened so I know Honolulu International Airport picked this object up on their radar.  I wish everyone could have seen this as it was truly amazing!!!<n>

All of a sudden we both saw a black apache helicopter fly no more than 100 ft off the ground and directly over head of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night I was sitting out on my porch in South Elgin, Il. It was around 12:30 am when i looked up in the sky and saw an object ive never seen before.  It slowly hovered up and over the tree line directly east from me.  I watched this orange and yellow light slowly rise.  The top portion of the object was bright orange shaped like an upside down bowl.  It had a bright yellow band in the center, with the the orange shape repeating it self on the bottom.  I watched it hover in spot for several minutes, then slowly move into the tree line.  After it moved into the tree line it then shot directly into the sky outta sight.  At that time it left i heard several helicopters in the area.  From where i was sitting it was roughly 3-5 miles away.  From my point of view I was sitting at a! n angle of 60 degrees from my postion.  I was born and rasied in the chicagoland area, for 25 years of my life i lived at an end of a runway in Elk Grove Village.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen an object of this shape, design, and flight in all my years of living here.  My father is also retired Navy from the Veitam War, so i have seen and been around aircraft my whole life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object just belew me away.<n>

To fully view the light we continued through the densely wooded area to an opening on top of a hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The front seat passenger and rear seat passenger tried to identify it as a star, however, it was visibly much larger than any of the other stars in the sky, including Venus and Jupiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, it was a different color than either of the planets and due to the size, appeared much closer.  As we rounded the road to the top of the hill, about a mile and a half away from sighting the first light, the rear and front seat passengers turned to face the object, which had now drifted to the Northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon relocating the object, and getting above the tree line, they noticed another light to the East.  I, the driver, was also able to see the objects clearly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were only about a half a mile from McHardy Road, which runs North and South; we decided to turn North onto it to get a better view.  While turning and advancing down the road the sky became more visible as the trees receded below us and about three more orange objects were clearly visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two passengers kept their eyes one the objects as we proceeded another half mile North on McHardy before pulling over and stopping the vehicle.  It was then 12:07 and we exited the car to watch the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, we decided to call the NUFORC hotline and report the sighting; also there now appeared to be seven orange orbs in the sky.  During this time, the objects seemed to drift or float toward the Northeast slightly, and nearly one by one they faded out.  It did not appear that they moved beyond our visible sight, just that they were fading and no longer present. It took approximately three minutes for the entire group of lights to completely fade (12:10am).<n> <n><n> <n><n> About thirteen minutes passed and the lights failed to return so we decided to get back into the car and head East in the general direction of the lights.  We traveled into Manly, Minnesota, before deciding to call it a night and turn back.  (NOTE: although many of the streetlights in this area were similar in color, what we witnessed were very clearly in the sky and above the horizon, also they were moving)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day we phoned the National Weather Service and found that the wind direction was going South at three miles per hour that night, and not to the Northeast, the direction in which the objects were moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of us are students at reputable Universities and involved in noteworthy activities on campus. None of us were under the influence of any legal or illegal drugs or alcohol.<n>
