1/31/04 21:00|Prince George (Canada)|BC|Light|two hour spread?|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Dozens of residents see lights in the sky.|3/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35536.html|4|ndxe200401| Dozens of residents see lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening of January 31, 2004 a large number of Prince George residents were stunned and puzzled over what they were witnessing in the night sky between 8:00 - 10:00 p.m., PST. Some called the Prince George Citizen newspaper to explain what it was they saw, and how peculiar it was. All of the witnesses, by the dozens, observed two extremely bright, orange circular lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights stayed fairly close together and did not make any sudden moments. Many residents reported the lights just hanging there for a number of minutes before moving ever so slightly. HBCC UFO Research was contacted by the Prince George Citizen enquiring about it, and a staff reporter did an interview for Saturday, February 7, 2004, newspaper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the weekend the telephone did not stop ringing. Many reports of orange lights came in from Prince George residents. Plus other very interesting reports for 2003 and back as far as the 1950s. Some of these reports included beams of lights hitting their vehicles as they travelled along the highway. A huge ball of light hovering over the tree tops not making any sound. A line of red balls of light sitting stationary in the night sky, etc...<n> <n><n> <n><n> After taking the calls and listening to the stories, some of the descriptions started me thinking. More folks contacted me. Some had watched the whole event unfold viewing the lights through binoculars. A retired military man was certainly the key to this case. Plus another lady who also gave a great description of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made several enquiries to the RCMP but the police had no information about the matter and took no calls from the general public over it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I typed up a few reports below from the eye witnesses who called in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report #1 Report received February 7, 2004 Prince George, British Columbia  Date: January 30, 2004 Time: Between 8:00 &amp; 9:00 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a call from a lady on February 7, 2004 who wanted to file a report on something she and her husband witnessed as they were driving down Tabor from 15th. They looked to the east and saw lights in the sky and thought at first it may have been an airplane. The witnesses mentioned they saw no strobe lights which they knew an aircraft would have. They reported the lights were moving rather slowly. As they drove down the road they passed by the trees which blocked their view of the lights in the sky. After they came to a clear area, they stopped the car and looked to the south and again noticed the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses told me that when they saw it again, this time it appeared to look like a black balloon, or umbrella shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lady said it looked as if the object would flip over, so the umbrella appearance was at the bottom and then would show up back on top. The lady and husband reported not a sound coming from it and whatever it was dropped downwards. The couple reported the lights as being white in color. The witnesses estimated they observed the event for approx: 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The folks didn&#39;t believe the object was very far from their location and said it wasn&#39;t that high up when they first saw it. Also they finally lost sight of the lights when they dropped down low enough that homes finally blocked their view. The people estimated the size to be roughly that of a golf ball. One other note, the witnesses said they believed that the lights were moving diagonally as they came closer to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report #2 Report received February 7, 2004 Prince George, British Columbia  Date: January 31, 2004 Time: Between 9:00 - 9:30 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A gentleman called to report seeing the orange lights witnessed over Prince George on January 31, 2004. He and his wife live near 1st &amp; Foothills in Prince George and were planning an evening out when the walked out of their home, which faces towards the downtown area they noticed the two orange colored lights in the night sky. They said the lights were very bright and that is what caught their attention. The witness went on to say he is used to seeing helicopters and fixed winged aircraft flying over all the time, but what he could not understand was the brightness of the lights, also how close the lights were to one another. The couple stood just outside their front door watching the lights for a good three minutes, but due to them having reservations they had to get on their way. The husband wondered if it might be a UFO, his wife said it possibly might be a plane, but both still thought it looked rather odd. He told me he almost dismissed it at that time. But as they drove along 1st Avenue heading towards Tabor and not traveling very far the fellow decide it was time to pull the car over as he said one doesn&#39;t get to see anything like this very often or ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they both sat watching, they were able to get a good view of what was taking place. One of the orange lights appeared to be over top of the other or maybe off to a bit of an angle to the left. Another 3 to 4 minutes passed and the bottom light started dropping off towards the left and seemed to flicker a little bit. He thought it may have been going into some of the light clouds that were present that evening, then all of a sudden the light disappeared. The other light was still visible and stayed around the same area in the sky for a little while longer. The witness estimated the last light held it&#39;s brilliance for maybe another 30 seconds before it started to flicker. It began to fade and then would become very bright again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This went on for a very short period of time before it to vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again it was lightly overcast with a high ceiling. The witness also estimated the objects were roughly a finger length apart if one was to hold out their hand at arms length. The witness stated that the lights did sit stationary for some of the time, before moving. The witnesses reported no sound was heard, and no aircraft were seen in the area. At arm&#39;s length, using his thumbnail to guess at an approx: size of the lights, he said each one may have been one fifth of the size of his nail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report #3 Report received February 7, 2004 Prince George, British Columbia  Date: January 31, 2004 Time: approx: 9:30 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Calls kept coming into HBCC UFO Research over the January 31, 2004 sighting in Prince George, B.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below is another report from a fellow who wanted to tell me what he witnessed that evening. The evening was overcast and no stars were visible at the time of the sighting. The man went on to tell me that his daughter spotted it first and then called to the rest of the family to come out and look at the strange lights in the sky which were reported to be just over top of one of the local mountains. He explained that the color of the lights were an orange/white. The witness also said he thought there may have been a small tail behind each of the lights, but it was hard to distinguish for certain. The lights were stationary for a very short time when these folks noticed them and as they watched, the lights did start to move but ever so slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They said there were two very bright lights which looked identical to one another. The man&#39;s wife said they looked like landing lights from an aircraft due to how close they were together, and the brightness of them. They all ruled this out quickly as the lights just stayed in the one area of the sky. They observed the lights rise up for a short distance, still staying close to one another. As they watched one of the lights seemed to disappear quickly, but they didn&#39;t think it went into the clouds as he noted the cloud ceiling was rather high that night and the lights weren&#39;t close to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other remaining light was seen to move back, or away from the families location and it also disappeared. Both lights were extremely bright, and the family said they stayed that way until they finally blinked out, or just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These folks figured they watched the lights for at least two minutes before they were gone. The man said, how long they were visible before he noticed them is anyone&#39;s guess. They also reported no sound and the witnesses said if it had a plane or helicopter you would have certainly have heard it. The folks estimated that the lights were approx: 10 times larger than their thumbnail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the family for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report #4 Report received February 7, 2004 Prince George, British Columbia  Date: January 31, 2004 Time: approx: 9:30 - 10:00 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this was a very interesting call that I received from a man who resides in Prince George, B.C. When I answered the phone, the fellow said he had just read their local newspaper and that he could tell me exactly what the lights were that everyone saw that evening. Below is the report the gentleman gave to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fellow said he watched the whole event through a pair of field glasses. It was January 31, 2004, between 9:30 - 10:00 p.m. and the man claims &#34;it&#34; landed two blocks from his home. The witness said what he watched was a couple of night jumpers, jumping with parachutes with lights attached around their feet or ankles. The man observed them coming over from the west over the hill. He mentioned that he had a fairly strong set of glasses (binoculars) and was clearly able to see the jumpers hanging in their chutes and saw when they turned their lights off. One of them landed in a park just two blocks away from the witnesses home and the other went towards the Fraser River and the BCR Railway. The gentleman figured the were practicing night jumping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the jumpers were first spotted they were rather high up and he and his wife first thought it may have been an airplane. He went on to say the lights were a very bright orange in color, and the reason they were no longer visible was simply because they had turned them off. The fellow, now retired, was in the military himself and had done a lot of jumping and as soon as he spotted the orange lights he thought it looked familiar due to the descent, plus the way the lights were traveling. When he looked through his binoculars he knew exactly what it was he was seeing. He figured the jumpers used their lights to keep track of each other and to designate where they were going to. Once they started getting closer to the ground they turned off their lights and just used the lights from the city to land. He also said the chutes were beautiful, very modern shaped parachutes and the jumpers with such good gear were able to carry out some of the antics they pulled off that cold evening. It was actually comical as the witness said one of the jumpers almost turned himself upside down and then this would give the impression of the lights going back up into the night sky. The two jumpers were carrying out some acrobatics on their way and obviously no sound was reported.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you very much to the witnesses for their reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

But I just read a report from Feb. about a guy on the 101 and 134 that seems similar to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving west on the 91 freeway at approx. the lakwood exit (before merging onto the 91, 57 merge) I was looking west (straight ahead) and the ridge line is to my left. I saw the usual aircraft lights above as well as to the right of me. Then out of nowhere I see 5 really bright white lights that appeared to maybe be in a swept back type formation allthough from the front, it was hard to tell. I was amazed because they were so bright and I have never seen 5 white lights on the front of an aircraft. The night sky was not cloudy as far as I could tell and most commercial aircraft that I have seen have one close to the fuselage on each side of the wing mount. The &#34;aircraft&#34; was rather low, based on the referrence of the ridge line to my left. It appeared to be moving slow as well. The &#34;aircraft&#34; made a slight bank to its right as I approached the merge to the 91,57 I looked to my extreme left now and could tell that the &#34;front&#34; was swept back, since it was night I could not make out the exact shape but could tell that there was a structure that was aft of the wings and there was a small &#34;beacon&#34; light underneath the structure to the rear. I could not see any marker lights on top where a verticle stab. would normally be on a commercial aircraft. I can only approximate its height at around maybe 2 or 3 thousand feet up (maybe less). I could not hear any noticeable engine noise (although I was on the freeway so it would have been hard to tell). And I am not aware of any flight pattern crossing over Santiago Canyon as a &#34;turn-around&#34; for John Wayne. If El Torro Marine Base was still active I might assume it could be a C17 although I dont know if they ever flew into there or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most striking thing overall is that it appeared suddenly, had 5 bright white lights on the front, appeared to fly very slow and was relativly low in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And was not in an area where I typically have seen &#34;large&#34; aircraft be.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were playing Playstation when out of the corner of my brother&#39;s eye he spots something out the window.  I quickly glance over and see a flare-like object falling towards the ground.  I didn&#39;t think this was a meteor because it was to large to be a meteor that burned in the atmospere (unless this meteor didnt burn up much).  This object resembled a flare, but it couldn&#39;t have been that either due to flares having a longer light life.  This couldn&#39;t have been a firework due to it making no sound, I dont think it did anyway.  The object was seen just over the tree line less than a quarter mile away.  I am 12 years old and due believe in other life-forms but even a skeptical scientist would have a hard time explaaining this.  I went outside to check for anything on the ground as this appeared to have landed.  I looked with a flashlight and couldn&#39;t see anything.  In the morning i will check again and post something if i find anything on the ground.  As i was writing this i saw a flicker out of my left eye towards the window but i didn&#39;t have time to look.  This object was orangish-redish in appearance.  There are many other houses around also.  I will have my camera ready if i see anything again tonight.  I will report if I see anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object was a bright blue color and am not sure if the color was from the object or a rereflection off of the object. It remained at a steady speed and came to an abrupt stop positioned between two clouds (they seemed to be two only two in the sky, making it easy to reference where to tell my wife to look...)  As it hovered, I told my wife to look, and we both sat and stared for a while. The object dipped both up and down. The color of the object then started to fade in and out, with the object still slightly visible as it shifted angles.

At about 9 AM I saw about 100 yards away a perfect sphere about 5 or 6 foot across hovering 75 yards off the ground that was moving very slow. It appeared as if observing from a distance. I walked towards it and it changed direction and as I compensated it changed direction again. Here is the important point, the sphere, I don&#39;t think I was supposed to see it because it was almost cloaked with the background. The closest I could come to describing this was that it refracted the light almost as if you were looking at a mirror ball in water. When it became obvious that I could see it in contrast to the sky by walking directly at it. It made several slow evasive moves, and then dropped away and down towards the ground and bush where I could not distinguish it in contrast to the ground and bush. Was unable to discern it at that point and lost my eyesight view to follow it. This event lasted about five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The sound stopped as quickly as it had started.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4:00am She woke again to a flickering light (like sheet lightening) in the bedroom and thinking it was lightening waited for the thunder to come.  When there was no thunder sound she thought this was weird and once again looked out our bedroom window (facing east) and saw four lights stationary in the sky, which then quickly disappeared (travelling away from her).  I woke up while she was looking out the window and there was no question that she was awake and actually saw something.  We live in the flightplath of Vancouver International Airport and are quite fimiliar with commercial airplanes, military craft, helicopters and such.  The airplanes that night were all flying inbound from the east, while the lighted object as on a different flightpath and was travelling to the east (opposite to the planes).<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 6 years ago I had a strange encounter at the exact same time 4:00am in the same house.  I awoke to our stove emitting a sound that it &#34;doesn&#39;t make&#34; and the digital clock on the stove was flashing alpha characters (it only does numeric) it has never done this before or after.  One of our sensor lights was on in the backyard and although I didn&#39;t see anything, my Aunt who lives downstairs did see something leaving our yard at the same time.  When I returned to the bed, there was a flickering light that seemed to come from one of the wall sockets and the same sound that she experienced.  We have not been able to find an explanation to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks<n>

As my mother looked at it suddenly faded out like a dimmer light. then suddenly it lit back up as if someone had turned the dimmer back on. It was about 2 inched above the treeline and not moving. I even saw a plane cross underneath. ( the blinking lights)It faded in and out and then started moving into trees. We went to another location by the house to see if we could see it better. The light seemed to have vanished. But then I looked up at a little star in the sky away from the first area and  that star got real bright just like the other one and dimmed out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The really strange thing happened the next morning,while passing the bathroom mirror I noticed a drop of a brown substance right on the tip of my nose. I tried to wash it off ( thinking I might have had a nose bleed) but it only came off after I scrubbed. Then sitting at the table I notice my left hand, the palm, was discolored with a brown substance,like self tanning lotion, rivlets running down my first finger. Even though I tried to wash it off it took all day to completely remove it. It was almost like iodine, as if I had dipped my palm in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

She wanted to report seeing a circular ball of red light approx: one block from her home. It was bright and the witness watched the object rise up from behind the trees in the neighborhood. It stopped briefly then moved slowly towards the west for a short distance before it came to a complete stop. The red light dropped down towards the trees, but stopped just short of the tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again it rose up rather quickly, then stopped and sat stationary for a few seconds. It finally continued it&#39;s travels maneuvering in a strange fashion towards the west. The witness said as it flew a long it would make a tight maneuver on a curve, in other words it looks as if it was going around a bend. The object continued in this motion until it was out of her line of sight. Also the lady I talked with had called her Mother out of the house when she first saw it, both daughter and Mother observed the object. No sound was reported associated to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witnesses for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian email: hbccufo@telus.net website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

We were driving home on state highway AB outside of Willard Missouri.  We saw an orange glowing sphere moving thoough the sky very slowly.  We pulled over at a closed gas station to watch it and see if it had any navigational beacons.  My uncle is a pilot, and has taught me about aircraft recognition.  There were no navigational beacons or flashing lights.  It was a constantly glowing orange sphere moving backwards and forewards across the sky very slowly.  It passed overhead and then dissapeared completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched it for about 1 minute to see if it would change locations it did not, but I did notice it move slightly from side to side then I went back inside my house and asked my 15 year old daughter to look at it and see if I was mistaken.She watched for 30 seconds and noticed it move, she was very frightened by it and went back inside to call her friend. At this point I had to call my friend to tell him because I new he would be verry interested. I told him what i was seeing and instantly he and his wife got in their car and drove down to the beach to get a close up view of the light. The area they drove to was west of my house and below the light. When they arrived at the beach they could see the same light I was watching. At this point my wife and 12 year old daughter returned home from picking up dinner she asked what was going on and I told her, they stopped and looked at it and also noticed its movements and agreed it was not a star. My 12 year old daughter ran inside the house frightened, my wife was speechless. The bright light did not change locations for 40 minutes. During this time we watched the light fade in and out as if it were traveling away from us and returning but after talking with my friend at the beach we agreed the light was revolving around the object, It soon faded out<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Venus is very prominent in the western sky, currently.  NUFORC receives many reports about it.  PD))<n>

While heading to the on ramp to I-5 south at the Chamber Way ramp at 18:47 I noticed a bright light in the sky just to the east of the freeway.  It was high enough up in the sky to later be obliterated from sight by some low rain clouds.  It was just getting dark outside.  I asked my daughter [in the back seat directly behind me] to look at the light.  She did and we talked about what it could be because we often see planes flying high on their way to SeaTac. This was different because the entire time we watched it [13 minutes] we never saw one of the usual blinking red or blue lights.  The light did not move hardly at all.  It never seemed to get closer, nor further away.  At one point the light was visible to my husband [driving], and our son sitting directly behind him.  We all were stumped as to what it could be.  The light was much brighter than any light I have ever seen in the sky, with the exception of a helicopter spotlighting the ground.  This did not appear to be directing light anywhere.  We all agreed the light was a different kind of light. A &#39;glittery&#39; king of light.  When compared to the moon it was like comparing regular car headlights to the new bright halogens.  Seeing as it was east of I-5 my daughter and I both watched it until it was blotted out by dark rain clouds.  We all watched it for a moment at a traffic light before entering the freeway and it was not moving.  My husband believes it was quite high.  I think it was much lower as it was about a minimum of 5X larger than the lights we commonly see on commercial planes.  There is a small plane airport east of the freeway, but this light was not moving.  It appeared to me to be about 6-8 miles east of the freeway and much lower altitude than commercial planes fly at.  I never took my eyes off it while on the freeway, hoping to see a familar blinking light to explain it away, but I have no idea what it was, or where it went.  The light didn&#39;t &#39;twinkle&#39; like sta! rs do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a constant light, bright enough to keep me from making out any shape behind it.  It was covered by clouds at 19:00.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> correction to prior report<n> <n><n> <n><n> I already filed a report on this sighting.  I think I mistakenly told you it was on the east side of the freeway.  It was over the west side.  Sorry for the confusion.<n>

There were 6 indicating a plane with six distinct trails.  Seemingly well below those I spotted a very shiny, silvery object which appeared as a boomerang or chevron shape on its side.  It was a very cold day and I saw no contrails.  It appeared motionless.  All I could think was that it looked beautiful against the blue sky.  I looked from several positions through a large window to see if it was a reflection.  It wasn&#39;t. The side away from the sun, in the shadow appeared to have a bluish cast.   If I held my hand at arms length and used my thumb and forefinger to get a size my fingers would have been approximately 1/8th of an inch apart.  It was at an elevation of 45 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a trained oberver as a Naval lookout aboard ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

1/29/04 21:50|Howell|NJ|Triangle|7-10 minutes|Two low-flying triangular craft with three bright lights|2/12/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34896.html|24|ndxe200401| Two low-flying triangular craft with three bright lights<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Thursday, January 29th 2003, I was driving home in a rural part of my hometown. It was almost 10 o’clock, and by that time of night, the roads in the northern part of Howell Township loose most of the pulsating traffic that defines them during the day. I was heading South on Brickyard Road, and as I came to the junction at State Highway 33 (business) I could see these bright lights (six of them, three on top of three) just above the overpass of State Highway 33 (bypass; I was just near where 33 splits into the bypass and the business routes) to the south of where I was. As I crossed through the light and under the bypass, I did not really think twice about the lights. Brickyard Road becomes Fairfield road through the light. I was continuing along that way, heading south, when I noticed up ahead, through the trees, the same six lights. They were now closer, obviously. Before, I had noticed that they were in sight just over the overpass, though much further in the distance then they were now. I realized how low the lights were. As I continued to drive south, it struck me that they were heading north, straight towards me. I stopped my car and got out to look on that cold night. Again, at first I thought it was one craft with two levels of three forward facing white lights. I soon realized instead that each &#34;level&#34; as I had described it, was actually one craft. I stood and watched as they came closer, seemingly right at me. I noticed, however, that the night was extremely quiet and clear, except for the occasional cold breeze. No sound, no jet engines, no chop-chop of a helicopter. I watched as the two craft turned west as they were almost over me, gained altitude and flew parallel to route 33. It isn’t really like they flew. It was more like they drifted, slowly and quietly. From behind, I could barely see them. The light seemed to be directed mostly straight ahead of the two craft. I never got a very good look at the structure of the craft themselves.<n>
1/29/04 21:50|Howell|NJ|Unknown|3-5 minutes|Strange, silent flying craft over Howell, New Jersey!|9/29/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39220.html|25|ndxe200401| Strange, silent flying craft over Howell, New Jersey!<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Thursday, Jan. 29, 2004, my wife and I were returning home to Howell, NJ after having dinner at a T.G.I. Friday&#39;s restaurant in Freehold, NJ.  The restaurant is located on Route 9 South, just north of the Howell border and slightly south of Route 33.  I keep a journal where I noted having arrived home around 10 PM, and kept a receipt from the restaurant that shows the time we paid as 9:41 PM.  It is about a 15-20 minute ride home from that location, so the time this occurred is extremely accurate - between 9:45 and 9:50 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we left the restaurant and proceeded southbound on Rt. 9, we noticed very strong headlights, very low in the sky and to the south of us, that appeared to be coming directly at us.  They were no more than 10 or 20 degrees above the horizon, and appeared to be slightly to the right (or to the west) of Rt. 9.  The lights were very bright, and we were at first concerned that a commercial airliner or two was heading right at us, because the height and angle of the lights suggested it.  As they got closer to us, we began to think they were from two or more helicopters.  Over a period of about 3 minutes or so, the lights continued to approach directly toward us as we crossed over into Howell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were no more than about a mile or so into Howell, and sitting at a red traffic light with dozens of vehicles around us on both sides of the highway when the craft crossed directly above us.  They (or it) was probably 300-400 feet or so above us, and about the size of a large helicopter (troop transport size, I would guess).  All the other cars around us could see what was happening, and many opened their windows as we did to listen, or stick their heads out and get a better look.  My wife and I were stunned, since they (or it) was completely silent, and there was no downdraft or other phenomenon to suggest wings, rotors, or propellor/jet propulsion systems of any kind.  The forward speed seemed to be something you would expect from a slower moving helicopter (30-40 MPH?), and just as they got over us they turned 90 degrees (but not sharply, more like a drift) and headed to our west (paralleling Rt. 33, but a mile or two south of it).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know why, but I am hazy on what kind of shape it was, or if in fact it was one or two separate vehicles.  Part of that is the passage of time, and for some reason I didn&#39;t really note it in my journal, but it was also difficult for me since I was behind the wheel on a major highway and the lights being thrown off by this &#34;thing&#34; was blinding.  My wife only remembers this entire incident with the same level of detail as me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know the exact date when this happened because of having read an article yesterday on MSNBC.com which discussed how sightings of &#39;flying black triangles&#39; are on the rise, and that they often appear over urban centers or major highways and make no effort to disguise themselves.  When I recalled what we saw, I put in some search terms on Google (something like &#34;UFO Howell Freehold New Jersey&#34;), and was brought to the NUFORC.org site.  When I scrolled down looking for reference to what I had seen, there was an entry describing the exact same thing at the exact same time from someone who was slightly further north of us.  The description of everything matched exactly, including the flight path taken by the object(s).  It was a perfectly clear, cold night as described by that writer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked back in my journal to that date, there it was!  I also ran a search of the archives for the Asbury Park Press, which is the major daily newspaper in the area, and the one and only paper that would probably have reported it if anyone contacted them.  Nothing came up in that search.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am astounded that literally hundreds of people were out that night and saw all of this from a major highway, and it was not widely reported that I know of.  The reason I don&#39;t remember every detail, or didn&#39;t freak out about it was that we are used to air traffic over our house all the time from the many military bases in the area, and we just assumed we were seeing something that was out for a test flight and wasn&#39;t really supposed to be seen so up-close by the general public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have an engineering background and work for the State, so I could appreciate that what I was seeing was some new technology I had never seen before, but automatically assumed it was military in nature.  It never occurred to me that so many other similar incidents had been reported by so many other people, including law enforcement types, etc.  Either I saw something otherwordly (which never really crossed my mind that night), or had seen evidence of some military technology which was far-beyond anything I had heard of before.  What doesn&#39;t make sense at all, is that the &#39;pilots&#39; seemed to be doing everything in their power to be noticed rather than remain covert in any way.  I would love to talk to other drivers who saw this that night, and find out what their impressions were, or what else they might have seen in terms of origin or destination.  Someone else also reported it in Pennsauken, New Jersey about 20 minutes earlier and that is about 40 miles to the southwest, so it must have been moving pretty quickly if it was the same vehicle(s) that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel privileged to have witnessed this event, and wish I could find out more about it!<n>

These big orange lights sat in the sky motionless for a moment before vanishing. I don&#39;t know how long that had been there before I saw them. I turned off of 31 to 501 and saw the other one.

It looked metalic and the sun shining off of it was so bright it hurt my eyes to watch. It took about five seconds for it to move from one side of the visible sky to the other. I tried to follow it but just as I was about to move to the next room it blurred slightly and I could no longer see it. But I could hear it. It made a very high-pitched humming sound, but it was very quiet. I had to strain to hear it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I saw another craft, but it was human. I could tell because of the slow movement and the trail of white smoke from behind. It followed almost the same path, but went past the spot the craft had vanished at.

It almost looked like it was throbbing, if that makes any sence.  I had to let the dog out anyway, so decided to get a better look.  I was outside for about a minuet and then I saw these blue and red lights clusterd together in a vauge shape of a crecent moon.  I didn&#39;t see where the lights came from, but they moved at what seemed to me to be a very fast speed across the sky going from East to West.  It took them about 6-8 seconds to move from the East most point of my vision of the sky to the West most point of my vision of the sky.  The lights were at a lower altitude than the star.  I am not even sure if what I saw wasn&#39;t a plane.  That is the explanation for everything....&#34;it must have been a plane&#34;  Of course I live where there are a lot of tall trees obstructing my vision so who knows, but in my gut I don&#39;t think it was a plane. There were too many red and blue lights.  This thing was bigger than any plane I have ever seen, and it was moving faster than I have ever seen a plane fly.  I don&#39;t know what it was. I do know that it frightened me a little, and I still feel a little funny about it.  This was only last night.  I am almost a little scared to go to sleep tonight...lol.  If anyone else has seen anything weird in the sky they should definatly post it.  After reading all of these I feel a little less &#34;crazy&#34;  Even my sister thought I had lost my marbels when I told her.  It is good to know that I am not the only one who has seen weird stuff in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They looked like multi-level ships that were floating above Pt Conception, not far from Vandenberg AFB. I could barely believe my eyes and knew that whatever they were they were very large. The only thing I could think of was 2 blimps but they were not shaped at all like blimps. Or possibly helecopters that are as big as buildings. They were highly structural, but not simple shaped. I had to turn off the freeway before the freeway turns north so I could not view them any more, and am wondering if anyone else saw these things as they were clearly visible over the mountains on the northwestern horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, there were no aircraft lights, and there was absolutley NO SOUND coming from it. I could tell it was not at an extreme altitude, as its wings and fuselage were highlighted by the ground light around us.  It was moving at a speed equivalent to a jet fighter, but again there was no sound at all.  Almost simultaneously, we all said to each other, &#34;what is that?&#34;.  It then DISAPPEARED!  I couldn&#39;t belive what I just saw, and my two friends said they saw it disappear as well.  We watched for a while longer, but it did not reappear.  At no point did we hear any &#34;jet&#34; sound.  It was shaped like a &#34;Y&#34;. I have never witnessed a UFO, but I think this is most likely a top-secret, very advanced military aircraft.  Incidentally, there were a few distant aircraft in the westward sky, with normal identifying aircraft lights, but no were close to or seemed to be following this aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will request more information from the witness.  We would like to rule out the possibility that the object might have been a satellite.  PD))<n>

He was watering the garden and I was thinking about the Aliens and looking at Orion&#39;s Belt. I was talking to my dad and I said &#34;Woudn&#39;t it be great if I could look up at the sky and there would be a flying saucer, and I would ask you to look up and you would witness it with me??&#34;. I looked down and stared at him waiting for a response. 10 seconds later I looked back up and looked again at Orions Belt. It was a clear night sky and you can see almost all the stars there where to see, millions of them. Just then in that same 30 seconds after told my dad about how great it would be to see something like that together, there it was very amazingly, a disk shaped object like zig-zaging through the stars at a very very high velocity. If I would guess at it I would say about a quarter the width of Planet Earth in a few seconds. That ship surely traveled very fast and was probably in a very big hurry. I bet all the other Space-ships waiting for the final clock &#39;dong&#39; are just sitting there and communicating with each other while they wait for the right time to intervine. I guess 2007 is nearing quite fast and if Nibiru is going to cause the earth to stop rotation for 3days (just like the bible says in Revelations) than I think we have something to be worried about, very much in-deed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name and personal information deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Distance to an unknown object against a featureless sky is impossible to gauge accurately, unless it flies in front of an object of know distance from the observer.

Our background include many years in the Aviation industry and this background most certainly convinces us that what we had seen were not any type of aircraft that we have any knowledge of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 9.27 pm we did notice what appeared to be several stars &#34;flashing&#34; in the sky overhead. The flashing got much brighter. There was absolutely no sound of any sort. The sky was clear and the milky way could be seen clearly, with no light interference from any near-by city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights eventually stopped flashing. These lights were white and appeared stationary overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another flashing white light appeared and then moved very quickly north wards through the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 1 hour after this sighting, what appeared to be a star in the western sky, simply got brighter and brighter, then as quick as a flash, just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All six of us are absolutely convinced that what we saw was in the very least unusual and would definitely not be attributed to any type of aircraft that we are aware of. We know what we saw and in fact are a little embarressed to mention this to anyone, however I am a long time sceptic when it comes to UFO sightings. I am now a believer and will not change my mind for anything!!! Myself, Phil, Peter and the boy&#39;s are now converts!!!<n>

1/28/04 20:55|Clarksville|NY|Triangle|7 min|As I was watching, it slowly began to move off to the left, above the tree tops.|2/12/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34844.html|39|ndxe200401| Last Wednesday, January 28, 2004, as my husband and I were driving home from an evening church service, we saw something unexplained in the sky.  It was close to 9:00 pm and the sky was dark.  There had been no cars on the road as it was a cold winter night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two lights ahead of us.  At first I thought they belonged to an oncoming car.  They were bright white-yellow and looked like car headlights.  What was unusual was that they did not appear to be moving, and the closer we got to them I realized they were not on the ground, but in the sky, not high in the sky.  They just hung there.  We talked about them, trying to figure out what they were.  They didn’t look like airplane lights; they were too close together, too big, and too low.  We tried to make them be helicopter lights (because they hovered in the air), but there was no tail light and nothing to indicate propellers anywhere around them.  All we could see were the lights.  As the road curved around to the right, the hovering lights were now closer on our right, and  I could see a third light under the brighter &#34;headlights,&#34; it was dimmer in intensity, but also white-yellow.  They hovered just about the tree tops, and we seemed quite close to them, but it was harder to see them clearly because tree branches were in the way.  I asked my husband to roll down his window to see if we could hear any noise.  He was trying to drive and look at the same time, and couldn’t get the window down fast enough for me - I rolled down my window, but I was on the wrong side of the car to get a clear view.  He stopped the car in the road, and I jumped out, and then I could really see.  There was no noise at all, which seemed very strange, no motor noise at all.  My husband pulled the car into a nearby driveway, leaving me in the road.  The area is rather rural and there were no street lights, no neighborhood house lights.  These lights hung in the air just above the tree tops.  I could see the underbelly of the craft as it was reflecting the lights.  It was metal colored and seamless with no  rivet spots where two sheets of metal were joined.  It appeared to be curved, but where the light reflection stopped, I couldn’t make out any overall shape.  I couldn’t see any wing tips or top or end.  I had the impressi! on it wa s bigger than our car.  As I was watching, it slowly began to move off to the left, above the tree tops.  I ran back to the car and got in, but the lights had moved away and then became hidden in the tree branches and I couldn’t see it anymore.  I thought the lights may have been on the front and the rest of the body was  obscuring our view as it moved away from us.<n>
1/28/04 20:55|Clarksville|NY|Triangle|7 min|Three bright lights in triangle formation hovered ststionary above trees over empty house in complete silence, then slowly moved on.|1/31/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34795.html|40|ndxe200401| Three bright lights in triangle formation hovered ststionary above trees over empty house in complete silence, then slowly moved on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On January 28th, 2004 my wife and I were driving west on Delaware Turnpike, a main road crossing Albany county from east to west and ending in adjacent Schoharie county, where we live.  We were on our way home from an evening church meeting in Delmar, NY, a western and well to do suburb of the state capital, Albany.  It was about 8:45 PM when we left the church.  Once you pass the high school on the outskirts of Delmar, the drive home quickly becomes rural in nature with only five small villages and a few clusterings of homes encountered for the next 30 miles. Our area had received 5&#34; of snow that morning with flurries still coming down out of a completely overcast sky.   Traffic was unusually sparse because of poor road conditions: slick road surface, drifting snow, etc.  It was dark and it was cold, about 10º F.   We were between Unionville and Clarksville, the first and second of the hamlets along our way, when we noticed two bright lights in the sky ahead and just a little to the right of us.  I first assumed I was watching the approach of a commercial plane that had just penetrated the cloud layer and whose lights were at each wingtip.  But the lights, very white, were also very bright I thought, and steady, they did not blink.  It really gave me the impression of a car approaching with its high beams on.  We continued to drive a minute or two more and I began to see a third light beneath and between the others.  This light was noticeably dimmer than the others and I could just make out the reflected upward curving underside of whatever it was.  But it obviously wasn&#39;t a commercial airplane if I could see the underbelly.  It was at this point I started working furiously to come up with a rational explanation for what I was seeing.  My next thought was that it must be a small civilian aircraft.  But what were they doing up in weather like this?  Lost?  Scared?  Not confident enough to trust their instrumentation and dropped below cloud cover to feel their way home?  At this point al! so I sta rted wondering when this airplane was going to pass us.  It never did.  New thought, it must be a helicopter.  All three lights now appeared to be the same bright intensity and from my perspective formed a triangle pattern.  I had to pay attention to my driving as well as watch the object and was desperately trying to judge scale and distance but in the near total darkness the effort was futile.  I could not get a handle on it.  All I could see were three white lights without the ability to tell how big the object might be or how far away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then things got interesting.  As I continued to drive the object appeared to move till it was directly off my left shoulder.  My mind was reeling with the effort to rationally identify this thing so I stopped the car in the middle of the road.  The object wasn&#39;t moving.  It hung perfectly stationary above the tree line and over a house whose occupants were either away or asleep.  I hadn&#39;t been able to see any structure to the object for a few minutes now, and I made one last stab at rational explanation.  I assumed the home owners must have had a ham radio tower in their backyard and had put up some Christmas lights that hadn&#39;t come down yet.  I also concluded that these lights had never moved at all; that our forward motion on the highway had only caused it to appear as if something was approaching us.  I told my wife this, but she said excitedly &#34;roll the window down!&#34;, which I did.  Our radio was not on in the car and there was no sound from outside the vehicle.  I began to feel comfortable with my last diagnosis.  Then she exclaimed, &#34;I&#39;m getting out&#34; and she abruptly and precipitously exited the vehicle.  I felt concerned for her on a road with traffic that travels 50 mph but no one was coming behind or before, so I made a left hand turn into the dark driveway of the house with the Christmas lights.  I pulled ahead till I could clearly see the lights and just sat and watched for a moment or two.  I must admit, I was totally unnerved when all of a sudden the triangle of white lights suddenly drifted off to the east.  Every normal explanation I could think of vanished in an instant.  My first impressions were solidly confirmed; there was something different, unusual, odd, about this whole experience right from the get go.  The object/lights meandered unhurriedly away, my wife got back in the car, and we continued our drive home.  (Let me add that the area this took place is at least 30 miles from any airport and we have no military installations.  Furthermore we have been making this trip twice a! week fo r 13 years and have never seen any commercial aircraft, helicopters, dirigibles or piper cubs low in the sky over Clarksville or anywhere else along our route, ever.  Albany airport is approached from the south and north along the Hudson river many miles away.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no time had I entertained any sense of danger, but rather adventure.  My only regret about this episode is that I didn&#39;t try to follow the object.  In hindsight that was foolish, but my wife and I were still a little scrambled inside, still trying to make sense of what we had seen.   I had long thought that interest in the subject of UFO&#39;s had pretty well died out after it&#39;s popularity in the 1970&#39;s.  Close Encounters of the Third Kind was one of the best movies ever made for the genre, but that&#39;s where UFO&#39;s were supposed to be found and should only be found, the movies.  And maybe California.  UFO&#39;s and earthquakes are both found in abundance in California, so I understand, we certainly don&#39;t have them in New York.  Two days after the incident I felt very strange about contacting your site after doing a search for &#34;ufo sightings&#34; on the internet, but there is such a desire to tell someone.  I was amazed at the sheer volume of sightings your website records, and interested at how many of the anecdotal notes have similarities to ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I are both 50 years of age and at the end of a long, happy process raising two good boys and seeing them graduate from college.  I work as a Supervisor of buildings and grounds for the Schenectady ARC (Association for Retarded Citizens).  My wife is a talented Special Ed elementary school teacher in the village of Schoharie where we live.  Her parents are both teachers as well, her father having taught at the University level for many years.  I don&#39;t wear glasses (except for reading), my wife does. Neither of us are on any medications.  We do not drink or do drugs, we do not read UFO literature and we do not dream of flying saucers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife will write her own account of what transpired independently of mine, and I will not show her what I&#39;ve written above until she does.  However, I need to end this by stating that a wife&#39;s desires are not always to be heeded, and that it&#39;s not always a good idea to pay too much attention to what a woman wants.  On the way to church that night the country roads were in such a snowbound condition she asked if we could take the Thruway home instead, a particularly unusual request for her.  Like most good husbands I would have been happy enough to oblige, it didn&#39;t matter to me either way really.  But after church I began our trip home the usual route, and nothing more was said.  Would you all agree, she owes me?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and he impressed us with his objectivity and sober-minded demeanor.  We suspect the event occurred as described above.  We are awaiting illustrations from the two witnesses.  PD))<n>

This is a brownstone neighborhood; the light looked much lower than planes or helicopters which sometimes fly overhead. I thought I was nuts until I heard a teenager nearby telling his friend about seeing it, too.  We compared notes and he saw pretty much exactly what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At 7:20pm, while taking my dogs outside, I looked up at the moon which was approx. 70 degrees in the western sky at the time, and I noticed what I thought was a satellite traveling across the sky in an easterly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to me to be the same intensity as an average star and was not blinking. I noticed it in the western sky and watched it move under the moon (about 3 inches under moon from my perspective) and across the sky, heading toward Orion&#39;s belt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the object for 1 min before opening up the front door and calling to my boyfriend, who was on the computer at the time. I told him I thought there was a satellite and he should come check it out. While he was on the way outside, I watched the star-like object pass through the constellation Orion and start to fade out, as if high, thin clouds were passing over. By the time he made it outside, I could no longer see the object in the sky. I pointed out the direction (southern sky) of where I last saw the object to my boyfriend, but he didn&#39;t see anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch the southern sky to see if I could spot the object again. My boyfriend was watching the sky to the NNE and spotted an object that looked like a star moving fast across the sky in a southernly direction. The object moved at first in a straight line, then moved erratically, and back to a straight line. The object seemed to him to leave sort of a small trail as it moved across the sky. I looked up to where he was seeing the object and I did not spot it. He lost sight of it soon after and also seemed to lose interest, as he went back inside. The duration between the time that I first spotted my object to the time that my boyfriend went back inside was approx. 5 mins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed outside watching the southern sky in the direction where I lost sight of the object I was viewing. I watched for another 5 mins. or so and spotted the object again, in the same place where it seemed to pass behind the high, thin clouds, as if it had stopped and started moving again. This could have been another object, I am not sure. It was still traveling toward the east, but the intensity of the light was not as bright as before, still suggesting the cloud cover. I immediately called for my boyfriend to come back out. When I looked back up to the sky, I could no longer see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very clear night, with high, thin clouds starting to appear from the SSW on the GOES-12 infrared weather satellite (I checked this 30 mins. later) but no clouds were visible from my perspective.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

But his posting on 1-25-2004 on this site is a much better description than I would give but the same. I went outside into my backyard to bring my dogs in and that is when it started about 6:30pm. It was so loud that all of the windows of my house shook. That is when I got my Wife and we went back out and noticed it was a humming noise like a heart beating. When I tried to locate it is when it hit me it wasn&#39;t something you could pinpoint it seemed to engulf the area it was massive, like standing on a runway just as a B-52 flew an inch over your head before touching down. When it stopped is when we noticed our dogs barking and the people next door in thier yard and right then is when a couple of huge Helicopters flew over headed west. Every since that night my Wife and I have heard these Helicopters almost daily and I&#39;ve finally found out that they&#39;re Blackhawks from Nellis And have watched them fly radials in certain areas for 30 minutes over our part of town before increasing then heading west. It&#39;s just nice to know someone else has heard this noise now we know we aren&#39;t nuts<n>

After taking a better look I relized these were no ballons. They were flying together in a tight fomation like figther jets do, and moving very fast in a straight line. These objects where moving from west to east along the Mississippi River. The 2 objects where silver or could have been white in color and were round inshape, they were about 1200 feet off the ground and were making no sound at all. The sky was clear in the area I saw these objects, another thing I noticed that there were a lot of Jets in the sky on this day, some very high and some kinda low but more jets then usual. I can say this much, these things were like nothing I have ever seen before. After seeing these ojects I noticed they made me somewhat confussed and even a little frighten, really hard to explain the feeling that came over me after seeing them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hear people on the TV say they see things in the sky and often I wonder if they are telling the truth. Well here I am one of those people and I do belive them now. I am a 44 year old healthy male with a wife and 3 kids, I am also a small Air Conditioning Contractor, and after today I really do look at UFO&#39;s sightings in a different way. I will be looking up in the skys more often now for sure. All this took place in the day time right about 12:30 pm in New Orleans La.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We hunt out in the country where there are no houses and the roads are dirt. We came over this hill and ran in to a coon that jumped the road at a intersection. We got out and chased it. It got away. I was spot lighting the trees, found nothing. I said lets go around this section and see if he&#39;s down the road. We came around the section. I was doing about 45 mph, went down a hill and when I reached the top. There it was. A red light that shot across the road about 10 feet above the ground. It went passed a farm house that was on the cornor. His dog&#39;s were chasing it and it (the red light) was Heading towards the spot where I spot lighted the raccoon. This red light was the size of a basketball. I moved at about 20 mph. I could not catch up to it do to the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One was to my right and one to my left.The lights were similar to a large aircraft you would see flying very low, but the speed and agility could only be described as similar to a helicopter. They both moved at the exact speed coming towards each other meeting directly in front of me but still at a distance from me and then immediately with the exact speed started descending down. At that point I stopped my truck and said to myself, What are they going to do? Land on the highway? I was a little nervous to see what &#34;they&#34; were, but again started moving forward and soon realized that they were gone. I didn&#39;t see any lights to my right or my left. There should have been lights trailing off in some direction somewhere, but nothing. They were gone just as fast as they appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I turned away to clear my eyes(in case I was seeing an illusion of some sort)  after a moment, I looked back and the star was definatly moving in a zig zag way. I watched for a moment and went in the housse to get my daughter so she coukd tell me I wasn&#39;t seeing things, but the star was gone.  Tonight about 1:30 am my husband came in from smoking a cigarette and said he saw something too.  Towards the west a zig zag moving star.

So we changed our path from going East and decided to follow the lights and go North.  Then we noticed that one of the lights ascended up in the sky followed by another.  There was still one UFO on the desert ground.  Then the one on the ground followed the other two up in the desert sky.  The 3 (or 4 couldn&#39;t really tell) formed a pyramid formation and were each a different color.  One was green, one was yellow and the other was red (or orange couldnt really tell).  Then about 1-2 minutes later they all formed 1 UFO and the colors changed from all those colors to just a spectacular white color.  Right after that they took off really, really fast.  Faster than any craft I have ever witnessed.  The desert sky was clear.  There was nothing left but the stars in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was the night of 27/01/2004 between 1:00 &amp; 1:30 the early hours of the morning of 27/01/2004 in Lebanon, Beirut City. I thought you might be interested in the photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound of this object was so strange and so strong ! I took the picture behind the window&#39;s glass because I was so surprised and I don&#39;t even know how did I catch the object on the cam as it was that fast. I didn&#39;t want to loose it and I felt it is something so strange. I hope you will reply to me soon with more information about that picture, now that you know a few details about it. Also I was searching for some web sites for pictures showing something strange in the sky like my picture and I have found out that the pictures that I took are very similar to the others UFO photos on the internet.

It was very quiet inside (no TV, radio or music) and I heard a low, humming pulsating (like a heartbeat) from outdoors, hum, hum, hum like it was alive but like an underground motor. I went outdoors and it stopped.  We overlook Palm Springs, CA about 1500 ft above the valley floor; desert hills behind us. It was dark. I went to the east side of house and heard a chopper but did not see that either.  Then north of the house with my husband.  We both saw a solid red light faster than an airplane across the sky from east to west. I called my neighbor and she said she heard it. The vibration shook her refrig/shelves down. In 30 years, she has never heard or felt anything like it. I sensed the helicopter was chasing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Out of nowhere something flew straight over my head. I watched it until it disappeared behind some trees. It seemed like it might have been gradually falling(landing?).It was cigar shaped (or as I described it, like a tampon)and it was glowing white like a star. It also had at the bottom a tiny green light. It was going somewhat fast, but not fast enough because it seemed like I watched it forever. It seemed as if it had been catapulted through the air sorta. I did not hear any noise. I knew there was no way it was a plane, and my first thought was that maybe it was a bomb. I literally sat there waiting to hear some time of explosion. When I realized that I was not in any immediate danger, I quickly ran up the driveway, shaking, to ask my sister if she had seen it. Of course, she had not. I began to think of what it possibly could have been, avoiding the assumption that it was an alien spacecraft. I thought maybe it was a meteor, but what I saw was definitely mechanical. I also know a friend that lived in my city when he was around six and remembers seeing balls of light dancing in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I continued to watch these objects, I realized these were not geese. There were approximately 5-7 oval shaped, light brown in color, objects flying in a southerly direction over apartment buildings. They were approximately 2-300 feet above the ground flying in some sort of formation, like 3 in the front and 3 or 4 behind, they were moving too fast to be a bird, but there was no sound of any type of engine, as I continued to watch, the pattern of flight was somewhat erratic, not like that of a plane,there wereno lights on any of these objects, I put on my glasses to see if I could get a better view, and I could not see anything. I took my glasses off and I saw only 2 of the objects right above me, then all of a sudden, the objects, ascended very rapidly into the high thin clouds in a type of crescent pattern and then disappeared. I could not believe what I had just witnessed and had a nauseaus feeling at that point. I contacted a local news station to see if there had been any other reports or sightings- NONE<n>

It is emiting enough light to glow through the clouds, but the light is obviously coming from above the clouds, maybe at 10,000 feet or so.

It was quite high, probably as far as Venus. We weren&#39;t able to see it again, as it got cloudier.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were watching one plane flying east and one plane flying west and remarking how much the speed was affected. I live north of the PTI airport and glanced in that direction. There was a extremely bright disc shaped object in the sky over the airport at a high altitude. It seemed to be higher than the planes were flying. I got my girlfriends attention and pointed out the object. the only thing to compare it to was how Venus has appeared recently in the nighttime sky. She thought it must be a star and I myself remarked that it could possibly be Venus. As we watched the object appeared to be getting closer. At the time there were at least six airplanes visible in the sky and each one was leaving a vapor trail behind it. This object was leaving no trail and appeared to be coming straight down vertically and not horizontally like the airplanes. The object suddenly seemed to shift direction and begin to move straight up into the sky. It was getting smaller but was still incredibly bright. A small cloud passed in front of the object but the object was still clearly visible through the cloud when suddenly it just blinked out. When the cloud passed nothing was there anymore leaving us at a loss for what it could have been. The cloud was small and there was no way it could have gone in any direction but straight up without us seeing where it went.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Moved very little|6/4/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37081.html|76|ndxe200401| Three bright round lights at high altitude hovering in the sky  adjacent the airliner I was in. Moved very little<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just departed DFW International Airport enroute to Little Rock Airport, and we were passing through a Flight Level as announced by the pilot.  I noticed a bright round light in the distance.  Being an Air Traffic Controller I thought this was an aircraft at first thinking it was in a sequence to land with two similar lights behind it, but the lights weren&#39;t flashing like most lights on an aircraft at night do.  I thought then maybe it was in holding but the lights weren&#39;t really moving. This made kind of look harder at what I was looking at. I thought it kind of strange. They looked very similar to how bright lights are on top of a Radio tower or something but they weren&#39;t flashing.  Of course, it was way too high for a tower or a helicopter because of the altitude we were at.  By this time I am pretty sure were around FL 200 or higher. As we flew along what I initially thought to be a sequence into DFW started to look two of the lights came together and one was still in the distance behind it. These lights stayed like this for along time. The longer I looked the lights seemed to be in one spot the whole time.  THey were big almost round spots of light just hovering in the sky.  I looked around in the plane to see if anyone was seeing the same thing I was but no one was. These lights never really moved the whole time I watched and I stared at them til they were just tiny spots in the sky. They moved slightly lateral from each while I saw them.  They were not aircraft and I still cannot to this day figure out what it was.  I waited so long to report because I felt like people wouldn&#39;t believe me  or think I was kind of crazy, but after reading the report about the Mexican Air Force pilots and their encounter ( it was in the news not too long ago)...what I saw was very similar to what they saw.  I am not going to check any boxes below about being contacted but if anyone reading this wants to then they can contact me if they feel the need to<n>

The object crossed the horizon within 3-5 minutes.  I initially noticed the object when it was low on the horizon and was struck by its high velocity.  I initially thought it was a satellite.  The object appeared as a bright light (no collision beacons), as it passed overhead on a southwest to northeast course the object became brighter as it moved farther east.  A few minutes later, my co-worker and I were able to compare the object to other aircraft in the sky.  The object was 10X brighter ,5X higher and 4-5X faster than the propeller driven craft that were in the sky nearby.  I have never seen craft travel that quickly at that altitude and never appear that bright.  The object was much brighter and lower in the sky than any satellite that I have observed.  It appeared to be at the general altitude that airliners cruise at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial impression was that of a government test aircraft and it&#39;s vector would have brought it near Beale AFB in Marysville, 100Mi.

They thought it was a remote control airplane at first, then it got closer and was an oval/diamond shape.  They tried to &#34;catch&#34; it and it began to change shape and size. It was at times less than 8 inches in diameter and grew to be larger than a car before it instantaneously took off.  On 1-25-04, last Friday morning, it reappeared with two other craft. One was what they called &#34;christmas tree shaped&#34; and it had a bright yellow/white light beam the others did not have.The other was cigar shaped like a plane and had a tail like a plane, but no wings. The three crafts seemed to play with the children and were circling each other.  The children got on the school bus and while discussing it, they said another child overheard and began describing the same thing saying he saw it a few streets over. I have had experiences myself, so has my mother and I kept this from the children.  Until they described the &#34;mini ufos&#34;  I had never heard of this, however my research on the internet backs up what they have told me. These are smart girls that are not prone to making things up. The younger had also had a dream that Thursday night about an &#34;alien&#34; in a ship and that it had a &#34;tube&#34; connecting to her for what she says is &#34;reading her mind&#34;.  But she says that was just a dream and is very clear in making that distinction.  I have heard strange sounds around the house lately and the dogs have been very disturbed.  I have been trying to research  if anyone else in Rockwall or surrounding areas saw the same thing that day or recently.  I did not find anything other than a similar sighting in Indiana that same morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could see the lights all in a row it looked like a plane in the dark. It sat there for a moment then started to move. I heard no sound. It was red, green and amber lights. As it moved away like a plane would. I saw a airplane fly close by to the lights. This plane continued over my home. I did hear the second plane.

Driving home from work going north on I-5 we saw a large egg shaped flash appear in front of us.  I would estimate it was about 300-400 feet high in the cloud of fog.  It had a distinct egg shape to the light and was extremely bright.  I saw it flash twice the second time was slightly higher and this was seen by the passenger of the vehicle.  Seeing it flash twice gave the impression that it was moving at a great speed because it happened so quickly.  This was much too large and bright of a flash to make me think it was an airplane, it was probably to low as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then we saw what looked alot like a bright star moving rather quickly accross the sky, but it&#39;s motions were mechanical, not like a shooting star and there was no tail, and it did not aim down and the chopper seemed to be following it.

I observed the craft while driving northbound on I35 at or just north of the 119th street exit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could make out a dark triangle shape, with a number of bright white lights in the middle and on the corners and a group of 2 or 4 at the rear.  Did not see any red/green strobes or anything that looked like normal aircraft ligthting.  It was about the size of a nickel at arms length when it was overhead.  I watched it as it came from my left and in front of me and followed it through the glass moonroof as it flew overhead.  If you drew horizontal lines across my windsheild to divide it into thirds, when I first saw it, the object would have been about on the top-most line in my field of view.  Speed remained constant and rather slow, did not do any manuevering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While I was alone in my car when I saw it, there was plenty of traffic at the time moving in both directions so I would think lots of other people would have seen it. I&#39;m not sure anyone else would have thought it more than a regular airplane, but whenever I see any aircraft it gets my attention and I try to at least guess what type it may be.  The non-standard arrangement of lights and the fact that it was large craft flying low on a route that I drive every day without normally seeing airplanes got my immediate attention.  It struck me right away as strange enough that I was excited to be seeing it in a &#34;wow, look at that!&#34; kind of way.  Comparing it to military aircraft I am familiar with, it was too large and wide of a triangle to be an F-117, but too narrow of a triangle to be a B-2.  I have seen both of those aircraft in flight more than once at airshows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also remember being suprised at not hearing any sound, while you don&#39;t normally hear airplanes when you are driving, being as large and low as the craft was I remember thinking it was odd not to hear it or feel any vibrations.  I did have my windows closed radio on a moderate volume so I cannot say for sure there was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I consider myself an aviation enthusiast and able to identify most military and civilian aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home I searched on the internet for something similar looking and surprisingly found some pictures that I think looks just like what I saw: http://bcornet.homestead.com/files/litbeam/main2b.htm  In comparison what I saw did not have discernable &#34;beams&#34; of light, just bright lights at both sides.  Also where there are a group of 4 lights in the picture, I could only make out what looked like 2 lights that were enlongated and one in front of the other.  They were placed similarly to the 4 lights but looked like those would if you connected them with a line parallel to the line you would get if you connected the two brightest lights on each &#34;wingtip&#34;  The following is just my opinion on what I saw:  I would not consider this a &#34;UFO&#34; in the sense of space aliens in flying saucers, just something flying that I could not identify.  I would surmise this is a rather &#34;normal&#34; and unspectacular sighting as far as UFOs go, and is probably something military as clearly other people have documented the same or very similar crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The size of the light was estimated as the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length. The light was similar to those I have seen in the past- We live underneath a major air corridor directly south of O&#39;Hare and directly west of Midway airports in suburban Chicago. Southbound aircraft departing O&#39;Hare were operating in the area at 5000-7500 feet, and westbound aircraft departing Midway were also in the area, flying over the O&#39;Hare traffic.  The object was above both flight paths of the jets. At the time of this incident, the object flew high over an MD-80 aircraft departing O&#39;Hare. The object had no red and green running lights, or white anti collision strobes, or landing lights normally seen on aircraft in this area. It entered my vision from above and decellerated and stopped moving, about two miles downrange of my position. Then, the object blinked out, and after a second, rapidly reappeared as a star-like object and accellerated upward at an angle similar, and resembling a curve ball thrown by a baseball pitcher, only upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this type of object in the Chicago area, several times in the past two years. It decellerates, hovers and accellerates at an angle with amazing speed. It was ABSOLUTELY NOT an aircraft, as I am quite familiar with aircraft, having worked as an airline executive.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Object was low enough to see it well and it was procceding Southeast at a low rate of speed towards the Sandia Mountains. Upon arriving at my destination about a mile away I looked for the object that was now about the size of a dime and noticed 3 other silver objects the size of the head of a pin west of the Sandias very high about two to three oclock from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched these four objects for about five minutes and they continued due west. The first object was gaining altitude and was decreasing in size. Two of the highest silver objects dis-appeared out of site at about 10 oclock from my vantage point and the one I originaly spotted kept climbing and was about 11 oclock from my vantage point. The objects were heading west and higher at a goodly rate of speed. At about one oclock the third object dis-appeared from view at about 10 oclock from my vantage point. The original object kept climbing until it was out of my eyesight at about 11 oclock but further south than the other three dis-appeared.This was a bright shiny day here with visibility unlimited.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was NOT lightning !!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Standing in formation, 84 soldiers all witnessed a flash in the sky. The sky was clear and NO lightning was present although it could have just been an electrical disturbance in the atmosphere but I&#39;m not really certain. The ENTIRE sky lit up. Usually when lightning bolts strike you can see a path but this was NOT a lightning bolt. The flash appeared for 2 seconds and vanished.All the soldiers in formation just looked at each other and scratched their heads.Although the area is in the flight path of aircraft landing at Frankfurt Internantional Airport, there were NO aircraft in the area at the time of the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The property was in Dunkeld which is about 3 hours from Melbourne and was  in sight of the Grampians (which is a series of Mountains with very dramatic rock formations on them).I had a good torch which I was using to send beams up into the sky,  as I have always been a believer in Ufos since my first sighting as a child on the great Australian Bite....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned around and saw a object high in the atmosphere that was just hovering near to where I was standing. I shone the torch in its general direction and flicked the torch on and off a few times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object proceeded to descend towards where I was standing. I did start to worry that maybe it was not the best of ideas to try it as you never know... It was about twice the height of the house when it was just hanging there I could see that it was a metallic grid like pattern underneath with a faint reddish glow.  I was thinking about calling out to my friend and her boyfriend to come and see but I wanted to observe it for as long as I could.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure how it changed but the next moment I saw it had a Pyramid shape and glowed a faint golden colour. I saw 2 spots of light one was red and one was green on the  bottom part of the Ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called out to my friend and by the time she and her Boyfriend had come outside it had moved about 1 kilometre down to near the neighbours house ( Being on a rural property).<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both saw it as a series of bright lights zig zagging in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My house is in the mountains on the Skykomish River and it faces Mt. Wallace and Rocky Ridge. (It faces the North East)and that was the direction I was looking at the time. It was not a streak like lightening, but the entire sky lit up and the blue light went all the way down to the river and ground.  It was just like daylight for a second--except it was blue.  There was no sound made.     I am a 52 year old man, don&#39;t drink and don&#39;t really believe in UFOs, but don&#39;t know what it was that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Thursday, a blue/red meteor? or some kind of object exploded over the area from Silver City eastward to the village of Santa Clara, New Mexico. We live in Pinos Altos, New Mexico some six miles from Silver City at 7,040 feet on the continental divide.  The flash could be seen lighting up the trees, and the impact of whatever exploded shook our trailer with at least four distinct sounds of an impact.  We listened to our scanner as reports came in from the entire area inundating 911. There were reports that fragments hit at least two yards of residences in the area and probably more.  One distinct report over the sheriff&#39;s frequency was that a lady reported that a meteor fragment had hit her back yard. We contacted the sheriffs dept. and they varified the reports.  We will send updates on this incident as soon as possible. Very unusual.   ((name deleted))<n>

I took pix too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time listed above it was partly cloudy. I just finished warming up my car and leaving the parking lot when I saw about 5 up-right rectangles (cylinders), amber (like street lamps) in color, slowly come out of the clouds. I was facing West, they were heading East. First 5 then 6,7... I stoped counting. I franticlly grabed my old Nikkon SLR in the dark and put the telephoto lens on the best I could without seeing much of what I was doing. I managed to get off 3 pictures then ran out of film. I continued tring to take the best mental notes I could; they were in a zig-zag pattern (horizontally),then broke formation. The Northern-most one vanished in the clouds, another went North, a couple southern ones went South, the middle one was the most interesting because I could watch it with out any possible abstrution from clouds. I watched it go up, up, up through the clearing eventually vanishing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I later called PDX (airport) and told them my story. They said that it was reflactions of a jet in the clouds (I saw no jets,blinking lights, or heard sound). She was unable to help, so she directed me to this site. I saw these lights no more that 8 miles south-east of Portland, there has to be someone eles that saw them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As for my pix, the photo depatment could only do so much for my poor photography. Can I send the negatives to someone who can develope them more effectivelly?<n>

The video footage of this event of Jan 21,04 is astounding.  In freeze framing the video by way of milli seconds I have been able to see things which I could not see that night by my naked eyes. The computer enables me to not only freeze a milli second but to blow it up much larger to see just what it is or might be. There is a series of photos that I can only describe as the  fireball spliting up into many smaller balls of light all attached in a long rod like formation of 11 balls of various pastel colors of light and then it goes into a progression of from 11 balls of light to 10 to 8 to 4 to 2 to one the fireball shape. It does this a few times where it goes from a long rod of attached balls of light to a single fireball of light.  This is incredible and it happens so fast it could not be seen until the video was freeze framed.  In other photos is is obvious that the solid white interior of the fireball is moving very fast because it changes it position and angle continually. There is another unexplainable part of this footage that puzzels me. In the bottom of the screen there is a very small dancing ball of light that at first I dismissed because it was so small in comparison to the main fireball . This tiny ball of light moves from side to side and and then at the end of the video the main fireball seems to disappear and reappear at the bottom of the screen very small with the other very small ball of light. It seems to be communicating with that tiny ball of light. We could not see this tiny ball of light with the naked eye that night of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I drove my mother home on my way back to my house there it still was ...not moving just hovering over the ridge. At first I thought it might be a helicopter but there was no sound. I stopped and watched it for another ten minutes. Then I went to get my son to have another witness and we then watched it together for ten more minutes. Then it looked like it moved a little to the east and then it just disappeared. I am a 53 year old art teacher. It was a very clear night. I have lived here for 24 years.

My friend who was outside smoking a ciggarette called my husband and myself outside to take a look at something in the sky. This is what I and two wittness saw. It looked like the planet Venus except that it was many times brighter and bigger and started moving up and down and side to side and sometimes in a circular motion. It was apox. 6:50 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then told my husband to get our digital camera with tripod to try to take a picture/video but to no avail. My friend had a flash light and I ask him to flash it at the object, what he did was a series of three dots and three dashes. We all saw the object flash back. I then called my friend in southern California to ask her to go outside and see if she could see anything and thats when she told me to call you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend has a compass watch and said the object/star was at a bearing 217 degrees in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went into the house to call Mr. Davenport I saw the object slowly move behind the redwood covered hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((name deleted)) P.S. I did sit down and kept very still to make sure my eyes were focused on the object and not playing any tricks on me.<n>
1/21/04 18:23|Aloha|OR|Circle|3 minutes|This was no sattelite!|1/22/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34605.html|106|ndxe200401| This was no sattelite!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on my back patio, looking through my binoculars to find my usual sattelite sightings. This was the second paticularly clear nights. I found one sattelite following it&#39;s normal West to East path, when I spotted another much fainter sattelite directly above it heading in the opposite direction. Only much much faster and farther out. I followed it for a moment, and then noticed it split into two. I shook my head and refocused the lense, and saw it again, still two. Now following parallel to each other at a speed I have never seen a satelite fly. Then it did something strange, it would come back into one, then split out into two, heading about a 45 degree angle away from each other, then come back to parallel each other. But sometimes they would jump backwards, as if my vision jumped. Only, they did it a few times. I would keep my eyes off center, and keep a major star in focus and steady to jude the movement of the objects. They were definately jerkish and would shoot out fast then come back a little then join together and head out. I followed them until out of sight, about 3 minutes in all. They made the other sattelite seem slow like an airplane, but I have been watching sattelites long enough to know the difference. Plus I fly. This thing was in my estimation about twice the distance of the sattelite I was watching, very faint, but clear enough to see it&#39;s movements. This was no sattelite. Moving at 90 degree angles, 45 degree angles in a split second. It was quite amazing. I truely hope some day, I see them again. It was remarkable. My background has included being a Police Officer-Reserve, a volunteer with the Fire Department, and trained in Disaster Response with UMCOR through a FEMA training program. This event was clearly not an airplane, sattelite or shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Large object manuvered, hovered,and droped at a high rate of speed. Other 2 objects did not move. all lights of the 3 had a strobbing effect.Witnesses watched with binoculars. one object was in the sw sky one the ne sky one the se sky. coast Guard helicopter was seen heading out toward the objects.At this point the witness went on way, they were on way to pick up Chinese food. I am reporting this for my sister , she doesn&#39;t have a computer. she called and told me about her and her husbands sighting.

Left work during my lunch hour and was in my car waiting to make a left turn at an intersection. Was waiting for an opening in the oncoming traffic to make the turn when I saw a car in front of me about to make a right turn which would be going in the same direction as me. It looked like my other car which my wife drives. Same make, color and year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The opening came and I started to turn but decided to look at the Licence plate. It was my Licence plate!  In the two seconds I spent there making the turn and trying to slow down to take a look at the driver (cars honking behind me) I thought someone had stollen my car. I looked at the driver and I was startled. He saw me looking and he was startled. It was me in my other car! Wearing the same coat, hat and sunglasses as I was!  I was forced to complete the turn but franticly tried to make a right in the first driveway. Keeping my other self in view in the rearview mirror. I saw him/me halfway turned into the street. I was now in the driveway trying to turn the car around to chase myself. Constantly looking behind me and around as I turned the car so i wouldn&#39;t loose him. I dashed back onto the street but did not see him to the left. Looked to the right and no cars were in sight. So I figured he must have straightened out the car and not turned but went straight ahead. So I went back in that direction driving extremly fast for two intersections and could not find him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over at a payphone and called my wife asking her where she parked the car. She told me she left it at the subway station as she takes the train downtown to work. I drove over there in less than 10 minutes and found the car parked exactly where she told me it was. I placed my hand on the hood and it was cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw my car and licence number and me in the driver seat. I&#39;m not imagining this and I don&#39;t do drugs. Did my reality cross with some parralel universe?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  At least, we assume it is approximate!!  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, so we are uncertain as to whether this is a serious report, or something else.  We are unable to confirm, obviously.  PD))<n>

It&#39;s color was a desert sand color, the nose area appeared to be a reddish orange.I took this color to becaused by friction of this missle against the upper atmospher causing the nose to heat up.It had no wings or tail assembly, I heard no noise and saw no exhaust trail. It appeared to be 2-4 feet wide, and at least 100 feet long. It was a solid object, without visible windows, or lights of any kind. It&#39;s speed was very rapid, as it crossed my 8 foot sliding glass doors in approximately 5 seconds, in a very horizontal path, very slightly nose down.It appeared to be so large that at first I thought that the Space Station had fallen out of orbit, then I realized that this object was not bulky enough for the Station,and therefore was a missle, I looked for news announcements that day and on Jan.22,04, a TV broadcast said something had fallen in Argentina, on Jan.21, &#39;04, that had caused a fire, with writting on the debrie that said &#34;made in Italy&#34;.  The local police and FBI, nor the FAA have any knowledge of the above event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual, a medical professional, and we regard him to be of exceptionally high reliability.  His description of the object was unusually precise, and very objectively described.  This event, we suspect, occurred as described above.  The witness had telephoned the FAA, who then telephoned NUFORC, and who then invited the witness to contact our Center.  We express our gratitude to the witness, and to the FAA.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport, I have been mulling over what I said to you yesterday, trying to make sense of what I SAW. I know what I saw, but you pointd out a valid fact, since I saw the missil against a bright blue cloudless sky, I couldn&#39;t really estimate the distance correctly, however I am quit sure of it&#39;s size. I therefore feel that this missil was in fact very close to me, in addition to that the closer it was the faster it&#39;s flight would appear to me,as it crossed my window. As far as no sound, the missil must have been subsonic when I saw it.Bradley Field, which is 35-40 miles northwest of me didn&#39;t see this missil, visually or on Radar as it was below there line of sight, Pilot&#39;s didn&#39;t see it either because it would have been obscured by ground clutter.Lastly the missil&#39;s flight path was more similar to a Cruise missil than a Ballistic missil, as it had a flat trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely yours, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

They thought it was a remote control airplane at first, then it got closer and was an oval/diamond shape.  They tried to &#34;catch&#34; it and it began to change shape and size. It was at times less than 8 inches in diameter and grew to be larger than a car before it instantaneously took off.  On 1-25-04, last Friday morning, it reappeared with two other craft. One was what they called &#34;christmas tree shaped&#34; and it had a bright yellow/white light beam the others did not have.The other was cigar shaped like a plane and had a tail like a plane, but no wings. The three crafts seemed to play with the children and were circling each other.  The children got on the school bus and while discussing it, they said another child overheard and began describing the same thing saying he saw it a few streets over. I have had experiences myself, so has my mother and I kept this from the children.  Until they described the &#34;mini ufos&#34;  I had never heard of this, however my research on the internet backs up what they have told me. These are smart girls that are not prone to making things up. The younger had also had a dream that Thursday night about an &#34;alien&#34; in a ship and that it had a &#34;tube&#34; connecting to her for what she says is &#34;reading her mind&#34;.  But she says that was just a dream and is very clear in making that distinction.  I have heard strange sounds around the house lately and the dogs have been very disturbed.  I have been trying to research  if anyone else in Rockwall or surrounding areas saw the same thing that day or recently.  I did not find anything other than a similar sighting in Indiana that same morning.<n>

On January 21, 2004, at exactly 7:00am the SOHO &#34;blue spectrum&#34; still shot captured the unmistakable image of a HUGE craft just above and to the left of the sun. I used Microsoft&#39;s PictureIt! 7.0 to enlarge the section of the photo to 999%, the results were truly amazing!  There is no longer any doubt in my mind.  The funny part is, though our government attempts to restrict public knowledge of these craft, it was their hardware, their physical evidence, and their website that published the data confirming its existance, LOL!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have inspected the photo, and although the object is cruciform in nature, we suspect it is not a saucer, but rather some data anomaly in the photo.  Just a guess.  PD))<n>

It started as a low intensity flash and suddenly became brighter. It lit up the early morning darkness like daylight. The high intensity light appeared bluish, similar to that of light emitted from a halogen car headlight or lamp. The light was witnessed by persons from Kaiserslautern to Wiesbaden to Koln (Cologne), Germany. The total incident lasted no more than two seconds. A friend related German media had reported the light was caused by a meteor reentering the earth&#39;s atmosphere however, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s been verified at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports in the press of this event shortly after it had occurred.

They were very bright and identical in form and intensity.  They were also positioned next to each other, which appeared to be odd.  They did not seem to be an astronomical body but to be in close proximity of the earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I reached my destination I returned in the opposite direction.  The two objects were still positioned in their same location.  I then observed a third object moving slowly in the direction of the other two and approaching directly overhead my vehicle.  As I watched the object through my windshield it sent a beam of light down directly over me.  I then observed a glare off of the hood of my vehicle and the ground surrounding my car.  At this point I became extremely frightened, since I am familiar with UFO literature.  I repeatedly glanced at the clock in my vehicle to note any lapse in time as I drove on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thankfully there was none.  The object then flew over without any further incident.  I admit that for about one minute I was very scared.  I do not recall hearing any sound from this object.  However, I was in my vehicle with the windows closed since it had been very cold that evening(about 10 degrees).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought I never would be sharing an experience I couldn&#39;t reasonably explain.  However, since this happened tonight, I can&#39;t focus on anything else.  First, I noticed what I took to be an exploding star in the east as I was driving home at approximatley 19 hundred hours (7:15pm, Jan. 20th, 2004.  Moments later as I came to the end of one road and make a right I spotted my neighbor&#39;s dog crossing at this intersection, and escorted her safely home. Then I was back in my car, backing out of my neighbor&#39;s driveway.  As I swung my car around and cleared the side of their home, and now crossways in the road, directly in front of me is an access road leading down around the back of my neighbors home to a backyard area (small meadow). Anyhow, about 1/4 of a football field in front of me, and directly straight up, about 1/3 length of a football field was what looked like a light fixture one would see at a football stadium.   It had three or four large lenses, (side by side) each a medium-bright glowing white light.  It did not have a &#34;beam&#34; that blinded me, but just hung there and was bright and glared. I looked beyond the side of the lights to glimpse at what was holding this up there.  What I saw was an outline showing that it curved away and behind the &#34;set of lights&#34;. I pulled my car ahead and to the side of the road trying to keep an eye on it to get a better look through my passenger side window....when it just disappeared.   I was at their home for only a few minutes to deliver their dog to them and it wasn&#39;t there when I took the dog home.  I came home; called my neighbor, and went back to their home to discuss and point out what I had seen.  They, like me, are mystified.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

One family member saw it the best; a very believeable sane family member I might add.  She said it was hovering just above the tree line, and that it was huge, about the size of a hundred airplanes.  It was metal and had very bright lights, and then the lights all went off and it shot off back into the sky until it looked the size of a very large star, all in a matter of seconds.  I asked her if it could have been a weather balloon and she became very angry with me.  My son also saw it, in another part of town and pointed it out to his friend.  Two other family members saw it in still another part of town.  It frightens me because all of the people I have mentioned above are wonderful, believable people who do not make things like this up.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was extreamly loud and unexplained. there was no events or anything in the area that would make this type of sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On 1/20/04 I witnessed two ufo sightings. I witnessed the same looking ufo that I saw on 1/7/04 and another ufo that was also circular except it had many colors. I went out to dinner and when I got home we were pulling in our driveway and I was telling my mom about how I saw this big buck near the woods on our property and all of a sudden this object off in the night sky instantly grabbed my attention. My mom noticed how suddenly I went quite and she responded by saying &#34;What is it&#34;? I quickly said &#34;mom I think its a ufo&#34;. Once inside, I went up into my room and grabbed my binoculars as fast as I possibly could. I ran back outside with my binoculars in hand and I looked through my binoculars at the object. The object was positioned to the southeast, high in the night sky. At this time it was just me and my stepbrother and we where both trying to see whether this was an actual ufo or not. Without a doubt, through the binoculars, we both saw the multiple colors and the circular shape. The colors of the ufo were the colors of the rainbow and were pulsating at a rapid speed through the binoculars. The object stayed to the east and cycled up and down constantly, at a slow rate. Without looking through the binoculars you could still make out a pulsating object with many colors. Though through the binoculars you could make out every color in the rainbow which could easily be seen. While I was in disbelief, that I was witnessing another ufo in the same month, my stepbrother was looking at a bright white object in the northern night sky. He asked me whether or not I thought that it could be another ufo and I really kind of ignored him. I easily passed it by as a star without giving it a chance even through the binoculars. While still very intrigued by the bright, colorful ufo that was slowly moving in the high, southeastern sky, my stepbrother seemed to not be able to keep his eyes off the bright white ob! ject to the north. He told me that he thought he saw it move and he also said that it was odd how it was pulsating.I gave a quick look at it once again and I thought to myself once again know thats just an extremely bright white star. Though at that exact time, it did look like it had moved and I think thats what made me give it a chance to prove it wasnt a star. I guess I really thought it was impossible to see two ufos let alone one in the same night. I really didn&#39;t start paying any attention to it until I slowed down my excitement of the first ufo I saw and then I really tryed to concentrate on the bright white object to the north. At this point, I realized that without looking through the binoculars the object was in almost the identical spot to the north with the same bright whiteness as the one I saw in the begginning of January. I looked through the binoculars and I instantly noticed that it was a circular shape and that it was pulsating bright white light. Though the only differences with the object were was the shape it changed to and its movement. It moved slowly up and down but still stayed to the northern night sky. The bright white ufo changed shape but not into a triangle but into a shape without any distinct qualitys. The bright white ufo started up in the sky and then ended up looking as if it was in my woods. We both watched each ufo equaly and we stayed outside for about an hour and twenty minutes. The bright, white, circular ufo was much brighter than the circular colorful one in the southeastern sky. Though both moved very similar and at the same speed. They both also made absolutely no sound. All I know is that I&#39;ve now witnessed three ufos in the same month.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

SR. 40 has a bridge that traverses over the Ocklawaha River in Marion County.  To the right, before the bridge, there is a small boat basin, complete with park benches where families can pull in and spend a day on the river.  This boat basin is directly to the right when you start to go up the bridge. There are very tall (approximatly 30 feet high) Pine/Oak trees all around the road and boat basin here. About 500 yards before the start of the bridge/boat basin, I saw something pass no more than 3 or 4 feet over the trees in that area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was solid black, darker than the night sky, and had red circular lights underneath it. I slowed down my vehicle drasticaly, rolled down my window and turned off my sterio to listen for either hellicopter blades or plane engines. There was TOTAL silence. As soon as the object had disappeared from the visible area above the trees, a Search or Spot light came on in the middle of the highway, and began to search up and down the road for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about 200 yards from where the spot light was, and in curiosity I turned on my bright lights to see if I could also view what they were looking for.   As soon as my brights were visible to whatever the craft was; The spot light disappeared.  I slowed down to about 15 miles per hour, and looked everywhere in the sky, and in the trees to see if I could view whatever this craft was.  It wasnt there.  It had totaly vanished.<n>

She and two daughters had at that time watched this thing for approximately 15 minutes.  The original sighting had it slightly Northeast about 30 degrees above the horizon.  Original sighting had it the size oo a finishing nail-bright white, occasionally changing to red or green- some bright blue in the middle of the white area.  We arrived and watched it for approx. 40 min. during which time it reversed course, circled, stood still and then would continue SE growing smaller.

I remarked how blue the sky was today and that there were no chemtrails. ( seems like an everyday occurance) We saw an airplane to the left which was flying west to east. To the east of the airplane, we both saw a circular, white shape that was at first flying east , but then seemed to zig-zag side to side , then move vertical as well. We had to keep moving to keep it in our sight, as when we moved , trees would hamper our sight. We observed this object for about 1 minute, and both remarked how we wished we had brought our cameras today, since the snow that had fallen yesterday had made everything look so pretty. In comparison to the airplane it had to have been larger, because it was higher in elevation. We kept moving to keep it in veiw, but either disappeared from our sight or vanished in an instant because after approximately 1 minuter we no longer saw it any where in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Here is the text of the e-mail she sent telling me about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;I was on my way to McGregor. I had just passed Blue Cut (Rd.) and of course looking up in the sky. At first glance I thought what I saw was a plane; it was metallic shiny but then I saw that it didn&#39;t have wings and was going very slow. I have never seen a metallic helicoptor and I could tell it didn&#39;t have rotors. It was shaped sort of like a small blimp. It wasn&#39;t very high off the ground maybe a mile up if that. I turned on Schmidt Lane which is that first road that is on the left after Blue Cut Rd and it kept on going slowly toward the southwest. I looked down at the speedometer to see how fast I was going and when I looked up it was gone. I was driving about 10 miles an hour. It wasn&#39;t a blimp and it wasn&#39;t a plane or a helicopter. It didn&#39;t appear to have any lights like a plane or chopper would have. It was weird. I watched it for at least 2 minutes maybe longer. It wasn&#39;t making any noise either. So there you go. It was between 9:30 am and 9:40 that I saw it. &#34;  As she notes, she is an avid sky watcher. This was in daylight on a clear day. This area of TX is close to Fort Hood and is near a flightpath, so we see lots of aircraft and know what jets, helicopters, and such look like and move like.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking down the fairway at 22:00 where it is always pitch blackness and saw a flamming bright spot on the ground with two lights on the left, low in the sky.  The lights and bright spot looked to be about 300 yards away. I thought there was a fire on the fairway.  With the binoculars I saw a circle of bright light with heavy white vapors swirling within it and evaporating upward.  There were two bright lights above..one light was pulsing brighter and seemed to be a spotlight on the circle.  No noise. As time passed, the two lights moved slowly backwards...always low to the ground.. away from the fairway.. and the circular light with the vapors moved at the same rate...keeping the same distance apart.  I watched until 02:15.  Then, the bright lights were still low in the sky and were specks of light, and the circular bright spot was now above the ground, smaller too.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He was looking off into the woods to our right so I stopped in shock to try and see what he was so worked up over. I had to stare almost 2 minutes before I saw it. It was a black teardrop shaped thing weaving out from behind a tree and it seemed like it would look at us and go back behind the tree. I was scared as hell but very curious and being that I had my dog with me for protection I decided to move towards it. My dog wanted to pursue it by this point also so we began stepping off the trail and walking towards it. We had walked maybe 15 feet and it flew out from behind the tree and began moving away from us at a slow speed. I tried to keep up with it but even running it moved just a little bit faster than us. I saw no marks on it, no other parts just a black teardrop shape. Finaly it rose up between some pines after chasing it for about 3 minutes and from what I could see through the tree branches, it took off in a vertical climb faster than Ive ever seen anything move in my life. I just went straight up till I couldnt see it anymore. I was scared and decided to get the hell out of there after seeing it do that. I dont know what I saw today, but believe me when I tell you it frightened me. I never heard a noise either and come to think of it, it never seemed to hit a tree branch or bush or anything. It definetly knew how to fly well whatever it was. My best description of what it was made out of would be like describing the black glass that you see over a security camera in a casino or something. Very black and reflective. Other than that, I saw nothing else and didnt get close enough for any other details. It was about the size Id say of maybe two basketballs together.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be approx. 50 ball-shaped objects floating in a chevron pattern.  They were about 500-800 ft. in the air and going at a rapid speed.  I called my husband out to see it and within a minute, we saw another object, but sightly shorter follow the same path.  Over a period, we witnessed a total of twelve in all.  The objects appeared to be lit, but it is unclear whether they were just reflecting the light fron the ground. They all followed the same flight path and never moved out of the chevron shape although a few would lag back for a second or two.  There usually about 30-40 balls per string.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was opening the trunk to my car when it caught my eye.  I asked my mom &#34;what is that&#34;  she turned and looked and said &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;.  I went and knocked on the front window of the house to get my dad &amp; husband.  They came out and my husband immediatley said &#34;that&#39;s a UFO&#34;.  I ran in the house and got my mom&#39;s camera, we took a couple of pictures, my dad got out his binoculars and the video camera.  We took about two minutes on film.  It started out in one place for a few minutes then slowly moved to the east, then slowly to the north.  It was a yellowish amber in color and very big and bright.  Through the binoculars it bounced around inside the bright outer light and changing shapes inside, going from cigar shaped to bouncing circles<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with the husband, who described the sighting in detail.  The sky was completely overcast, and the object appeared to be below the overcast.  The witness is attempting to determine how high the overcast was on this night.  The object was distinctly orange and yellow, he reported, and there appeared to be something projecting out beyond the colored portion of the object.  In addition, there may have been detail that was visible with binoculars inside the bright portion of the object.  We are awaiting the video, or still frames from it.  PD))<n>

From all the nights I&#39;ve been gazing, I&#39;ve never seen this particular one before.  I was a little stunned at how BIG it was. Big and very very bright! It didn&#39;t twinkle, like some of the other stars did and for a brief moment got really spooked.  I ran inside and did an Instant Message to my mother (who is in Nantucket, MA) and told her what I was seeing. She asked if I could take a digital picture of it.  So I attempted to.  I took a picture of the regular stars directly above me, of the little dipper and Orion&#39;s belt, but couldn&#39;t actually see it through the view finder. I took the picture anyway. I then faced that bright star and actually saw it through my view finder.  That&#39;s gotta tell you right there how bright it was. I downloaded it to my computer and it showed up, blurred, as I couldn&#39;t keep a steady hand.  I proceeded to try and take several steadier pictures but couldn&#39;t.  I concluded that maybe it&#39;s the planet Venus but I&#39;m not Astronomically inclined and don&#39;t know it&#39;s position. I figure I&#39;ll check back after an hour or so and see if it moves with the rest of the constellations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend showed up to watch a movie with me but before we did, I pointed it out to him and he was just as baffled.  He said he thought it was too low to be a star. Then thought it was a plane.  But I said it&#39;s been stationery like that for the past 1/2 hour or so, it can&#39;t be a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the movie and about an hour later (9:30 pm), I stepped back outside to check on it.  It had faded to a smaller redder shape and much lower to the horizon.  Next thing I knew I was holloring for my friend to come see it.  It got extremely bright again, I mean BRIGHT then would fade out then bright again, then fade etc... I asked him if there was a lighthouse around here and he said no.  Then the faded light slowly moved to the right and lit up bright again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ... It&#39;s gone now..... I don&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a brief description of my point of view....<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my back patio, I see the western sky. I am in the higher part of Lake Havasu City and can see the lake and the Indian Resort Casino in Havasu City, Ca.  I can see the lights of the Casino. These are small pin points of lights and the one I saw had to be about 10 times brighter than the casino lights.  Not being able to estimate miles, All I can do is guess that the bright light I saw was about 5 or 6 miles East of the casino lights which is probably desert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am really baffled by this and really want to know what I saw. In the meantime, I&#39;m gonna research Venus&#39;s location.  :)<n>

We were all busy talking when we all got quiet cause we were all looking at the stars when shan who was driving told me &#34;what star is that?&#34; and I said &#34;what star?&#34; and he pointed it out to me and it was really bright we talked for a minute thinking it was the north star but he said it was in the wrong place and WAY to bright I shrugged and went to pick up the trash in the car when Alannah (my niece) got really excited &#34;its gone! Arnell look its gone!&#34; and sure enough me and shan looked at where it was and it was gone like nothing was ever there we were in a blank field so we could see the stars really good. I kinda got freaked and so did Shan so I told everyone to look around cause maybe it would reappear again and it did reappear on the way right of the car but this time we could see little lights on it like it was blinking Red, Blue, Orange we all got scared saying it was a plane but it stayed in the same place just blinking different colors for the next minute. Then it disappeared again but it appeared again RIGHT ahead of us (we were on a straight road) but lower to the ground about 500 feet and a mile ahead on top of a hill, by this time we were all getting scared even alannah jumped in front with us cause it was ahead of us but it kept moving forward blinking different lights and getting lower to the ground when we reached the hill it was gone. So we all looked around again and it appeared about a mile ahead of us the red and blue lights brighter than before all of us got really excited and we kept our eye on it till we got into town we then turned onto Heart Butte road and stopped to look, it looked to have landed on the hill by East Glacier road we could still see the lights flashing on it. By this time shan ! got excited and wanted to follow it me and Alannah didn&#39;t want to but he ended up going to the East Glacier Road and stopping by the bridge. We all got out of the car and proceeded to look at it cause it was to the right of the road facing north we could still see the red and blue lights but this is the strange part we were all looking at the one that followed us from Cutbank. When we started to look at the sky all around us we saw a the same light but Brighter on the left of the roadfacing south the one that followed us was facing North. We stayed there watching them both amazed at the colors of them they were no stars or planes they were changing colors to fast and to close to the ground. We left about 20 minutes later and went home (in Browning MT) we told my mom who went outside with us you could still see the south UFO flashing different colors but not as bright it moved back farther and to the right more she believed us and proceeded to call the Police station who then called the Cutbank Police to ask them about the strange light they replied in saying it was a Satellite. I don&#39;t think a Satellite can follow someone for 30 miles in a car blinking red and blue close to the ground. we all went back to the East Glacier Bridge and stopped to look at the South UFO it was still blinking colors but it had moved farther back and more to the left we stayed there about half an hour watching it get smaller and the lights getting dimmer. we took my mom home and went to go return movies at the local video store still able to see the light in town, we then stopped at my sister Belinda&#39;s house she was standing outside with her binoculars the light was still there in the same spot changing blue, red and orange in formation moving to the right like around a sphere about an hour later when we were home the light in the sky changing colors was gone. To describe the Lights it was like they were moving in formation in a circle flashing blue, red and orange when we saw it the closest it was definitely moving in a circle.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As these ships would rotate they appeared to change shape from disk shaped to almost like that of a eagle. There was flashing lights on these objects and what appeared to be beams of light being shot down from them. Where we live being that we are near 3 major airports there is generally tons of commercial air traffic at all times of the day directly overhead, however the commercial air traffic was obviously being rerouted to accomidate these visitors. The ultimate confirmation though was that there were military planes circling the area we saw at least 4. Our friend that was over visiting was really tripping because it was his first time seeing a ufo. This was just the most recent sighting at this location for my husband and I. Prior to living at our current residence I had never seen a ufo, but our 1st night here 5/20/01 I was awakened to the reality that we are not alone. We have seen ufo&#39;s many times since that night here,it appears to be a hotbed. Really it makes perfect sense since here in the extremely populated Bay Area there is so much light distortion and air activity they could conduct whatever business they have without hardly ever being noticed by the general public. We most definately noticed though and if granted the privelage in the future we will continue to notice as often as possible. ,<n>

It was standing still. I stopped to take a better look. Then it started to move very slowly. The strange thing about it was that it didnt look that high but it was a little light. It moved north. I followed it. It spead up and then slowed down real fast. I was in a main street when I started to follow and ended up in a lonely road. I flashed my high lights to see if it would see me. It flew over me and stoped. I was frightened. I stuck my head out the window to see it clear. It was weird hard to explain. Then the light became a tiny dot. It seemed like it was trying to hide. If I had not seen it turn into that tiny dot I would have never Known it was there. The dot moved the same as when it was big. I followed it until the road ended. Then I had to turn around and I lost it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

He is 25 and I am 23.  We left Red Deer, AB and were driving towards Edmonton.  We got about half ways towards Edmonton and ahead of us we could see what we thought at first was an airplane with lights.  It was dark out so we couldn&#39;t really see anything but the lights at first.  We got a bit freaked out then because it was not moving.  It was just hovering in one spot and that is when we realized that it was not an airplane or a helicopter or anything.  As we kept driving it was directly above us, and it looked light a big circle with lights on it, and from the lights we could see beams of light coming off of them that looked a bit like the Northern Lights.  We kept driving and then in the sky out my right window we could see a circular ball of light that was bluish-green.  The ball of light would divide and split into 4 balls of light and the 4 balls of light went around in a circle and then combined in the middle again to make one ball.  Then it would go all over again.  I don&#39;t know exactly what this was, but I do believe in UFO&#39;s now, which for me to say, it obviously happened because I used to be very skeptical of UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??

The triangular shape was more specifically like a science model of a molecule, approximately 20-30 feet high and 20-30 feet wide. It had a star of many points at the center (nucleus region)which was blinking white and red light. It had an extremely bright and flashing light above this center, and two bright lights below at a 90 degree separation. The craft was moving slowly, almost hovering for a moment, then it ascended and seemed to retract the outer lights and continue in a slow westerly direction. Further north, we observed another craft, shaped more like a plane, but the sharply pointed bulk head was all white light and there were too many flashing red and white lights for it to be a plane. The exact shape of the body of both objects, which presumably connected these lights, was too dark to ascertain. Both objects flew too low to the ground to be regulated aircraft and flew at a very slow rate.  The rumbling of the triangular shaped object was intense.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am from N.J. not too far from Lk Hopotcong and around that time a snowmobiler fell through that Lake without a trace.  So depending on the exact date of the disappearance those were either aircraft searching or less likely, again I&#39;m not sure of the date he and his snowmobile vanished, maybe he was abducted as far as I know they still haven&#39;t found him or the snowmobile.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They appeared to be farther away than the island, but I cant tell for sure because I never saw them go behind the island. They were barely above the water, and they frequently disappeared behind the swells, then reappeared a few seconds later. They only moved in one steady direction, and appeared to be going quite fast, if I had to estimate I would say around 60-70 mhp, although it was impossible to tell for sure because the distance from me was impossible to tell. They looked a lot like the type of like reflected by shiny metal. It was not putting out its own light, rather reflecting the sunlight. I couldnt tell the shape of the crafts because they were entirely covered by the bright reflection. If I was to estimate a size or shape, I would say not more than 3 feet across, apparantly as a sphere. As they traveled, the distance between the two lights appeared to remain EXACTLY the same, they didnt spread out or come closer together. I am sure it wasn&#39;t a boat, becuase there was nothing under the lights when the came clearly into view above the choppy waves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Between Belleville and Centerville IL, there is about a 5-8 mile strrtch of wood encompassed Highway, and thats when we saw and experienced the following events: About a mile or so past Fairview Hieghts, I inexplicablly had the sensation to look over my shoulder and to the left of me. At that moment I noticed something very out of the ordinary. Shining down on the surface of the adjacent, Westbound side of Interstate 64/40 were three blue circles of light. Even stranger, was that these concentric circles were pacing our car...in the same direction we were traveling, on the opposing westbound highway. Then what seemed to begin happening is that a state of...Oh well,What can I do...feeling came over me, not fear or panic, just....Oh well. My friend looked over after I said to look, she looked back at me, we looked at the clock on her car radio and it read 4:05 AM. We looked back at the lights and then eachother, and the next thing I knew it was 4:30 or so by the radio clock and we were entering the highway interchange near Centerville IL. about 6 or 7 miles from were we had just been! To this day me and my girl still talk about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also saw about a Year later, another strange object at her apartment complexs in Kirkwood Missouri. It was about noon, in the broad day light. I went out onto her back patio to smoke a cigarette, and as I was lighting it, I looked up to my left to see a jetliner cruise by and its contrail forming. Only, at the end of the contrail, and seemingly following the jetliner, was a bright green, glowing sphere of light. As soon as I noticed it though and called for my griend to qiickly grab her camera, it seemed to take notice in me. It bounced arounded and darted from point to point in the sky, almost as if it were putting on a show for me, just to make a point of saying &#34;Hi you can see me, I also see you.&#34; It kept this up until my friend returned with her camera, at which point this object shot right to my zenith. She quickly snapped a picture, and with that the object simply zipped off out of view. Although we knew whatever came out on that film would be low and questionable quality, nontheless we were still excited to see what we did have on it. When the film was developed though, oddly, every single print was blank.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The objects look like they&#39;re spinning.  They hung around for a long time, so long we went to bed.

Suddenly a swirling circular distortion appeared in the ceiling above me. It was approximately 2 to 3 feet in diameter. It looked like the reality of the ceilng was rippling like water. Within a moment of it&#39;s appearance a bright intense shining ball, the size of a softball, glowing like a light bulb with a surface like glass, fell down out of the swirling circular distortion. It fell within about 3 inches from the floor in front of me. All-of-sudden a long thin green arm, glowing light fluorescent green, reached down out of the ceiling and snatched up the ball and jerked back up into the circular rippling distortion. The arm was extremely long to be able to reach out of the ceiling and snatch the ball up (the ceiling is 8 feet from the floor). This all happened within seconds. As the arm was retracting into the ceiling I  aroused my boyfriend but by the time he fully arose and opened his eyes it was all over. He believed me though. He has also had many strange waking abduction experiences over the years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is also a second strange occurence to this happening. My borfriend&#39;s brother lives in the same house with us. Over the years he has heard his brother moaning in his bed at night and after his brother wakes him up he seems to remember a shadowy presense in the room, some kind of entity, and having long scaly fingers pushed over his mouth, and being frozen in place and being dragged from his bed. He swears he&#39;s been awake when this happens. His brother always finds him awake , shaken, remembering details. Well, later on last night (about 3:00 AM, January 15, 2004) his brother heard my boyfriend (I had finally fallen asleep) start moaning just like all the other times he had abduction experiences. My boyfriend remembered nothing this time though. We are all sane grown people who have not been diagnosed with scitzofrenia and I was wide awake watching TV. I have never told anyone about these things throughout my life for fear of ridicule but this was so strange this time that I had to tell someone. I don&#39;t know if you care about these types of sightings but I thought the glowing, light bulb-looking, softball size orb could be considered as a UFO.<n>

It seemed to hover up the road and the flew off into the woods. A minute later the object, or one like it approached from the left shot out in front and hovered like before. This object was above any streetlights and seemed to be producing its own light. It was a soft, white, pulsing glow. After a few seconds and before I could approach it completely, it dashed off eastward and that was all I saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was shaped like a disk but on either end had one, wavy, streamerlike &#34;tentacle&#34; that also seemes to glow a bit and when the craft was moving, these would flow behind it.

As he made a north turn to the gravel road that led to my mother&#39;s house he noticed that the craft was about less than a 1/4 mile in front of him and flying pretty low just above the treeline.  As he got closer he rolled down his car window and to his surprise the craft did not have any type of engine noise to it and it was just sitting up in the air not moving at all.  There was at least 3 lights on it.  One was blinking toward the NE about the size of a flashlight and another one on the opposit side that was just steady but a little brighter.  There was another steady light in the center of the other two lights.  Againts the skyline, my husband could only make out an oval shape craft about 25 ft. across and had dome-shaped top.  Realizing that he must be the only one witnessing this he sped to my mother&#39;s house to pick me up, which was only a few seconds away, but the craft was already gone by the time we got back to sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husbands never had any opinions or beliefs in UFO but he knows what he saw that night was not an airplane or any king of jet.

I could see the blinking lights of a large aircraft in the northern sky at the same time and this object was moving so fast it made the aircraft appear to almost be standing still.

But i somehow looked up,and saw a pink circle for a sec. then woke up! When i woke up i had a relief feeling. But i then tried to roll onto my right side, facing my cousin,but i couldn&#39;t move again! All i could do was move my eyes. So i panicked again! I felt a tingle feeling,like your foot is asleep. I felt it at my neck and shoulders,and my feet,it faded away,disapearing at my waiste. I calmed down and was able to move again.I rolled over on my back. Then i sat up andtried to breath normal, Then something caught my eye,i looked out the window, and there it was. All i saw was a blue,purple and pink blur with a white dot Seeming to be on top,soaring in a zig-zag formation, Then it finally zoomed off! It scared the crape out of me! So i went to go tell my mom(who was downstairs)What happened. What i realized though, was the blanket...was exactly how i dreamt it wraped around me! And...i had an impression in my foot that hurt where i felt it hurt in my dream!So i ran downstairs and told my mom. But she just told me it was a dream and to go to sleep. I am not sure what exactly happened to me in that time i was asleep,but i KNOW what i have just told you is real! No matter what any one says or thinks! I know! I&#39;ve  asked my mom if i could even go to theropy to ! be hypnotized,she said no. I think about it though, and i kind of don&#39;t want to know! But since then...i have seen different things in the sky. I see an orange,red,and yellow ball moving around the moon Almost every other night.I have also had strange marks appear on my legs and back. Not very often, but they pop up the next morning when they were not there that night before. If there is anything you could do to make it easier to tell my experiences, please do! And any advice how to handle any more visits,also make it findable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

The point of light moved erratically to the right, then downward and to the left and then roughly northeast and out of my field of vision behind the apartment building, all the time very wobbly and erratic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a lot of air traffic in the area and, being a private pilot myself, I am familiar with most aircraft lighting configurations.  What&#39;s more, there was an airliner visible several miles behind the luminous object heading nearly due west while the object moved in the foreground.  I had no way of estimating its size or range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t say for sure what the luminous object was, but I can say with some confidence what the object was not.  It wasn&#39;t a meteor because it stopped and reversed direction.  It was not a model airplane because it moved too rapidly, and it was not a balloon because it was a windless evening and again, it moved too quickly.  It was almost certainly not a firework or flare --- it moved silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first unusual sighting I&#39;ve observed in the night sky.  I was not dreaming or intoxicated.  In fact, the event happened so quickly that I didn&#39;t have a chance to be surprised.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I live near the airport, so assumed planes, but it caught my attention because they never fly 5 in that close of airspace.  Never.  I grew up here,and have witness planes my entire life.  Then, I noticed that they were hovering, not moving.  So I stopped my car, on the street in front of my home, and watched.  Four were silver, one was bright white.  They did not move, at all, and they were very close to one another.  Then I said, almost flip, &#34;Ok, I&#39;m home you guys can leave now&#34; and the white one gave 4 quick flashes of light, and then began to move between the other 4, which were outlying in a rough circle pattern, though not quite a circle.  They were beauitful, what I could see, and seemed powerful.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was very dark, quite opaque. If you can imagine a thick black pen mark drawn into the sky, but very crisp. I would swear on all my senses that it was solid. It wasn&#39;t above us, it seemed to be directly to the side of the plane, far off, but who knows depending on its actual size. It was stationary --hovering, if you will. It looked like a perfect tear in the sky. We were heading west, so it was to the north of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can understand where you might think it was a shadow of some kind, but it was so perfectly linear, not at all hazy or smokey. Like a perfect black line segment in the sky, short and constant. After viewing it for a while, one more became clearly visible above and behind it... it seemed to be futher back but there is limited perspective in the air, as you know. The new one was slightly covered by a cloud haze though, and not as clear as the foremost one. Also, they didn&#39;t disappear, but we eventually moved out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took the time to go through the other sightings on your website, and it seems as if at least two other reports are very similar, if not exactly, what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33934.html<n> <n><n> and<n> <n><n> http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32509.html<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m also at a loss as to what it was we witnessed.

It was apparant to me and my roommate (who was driving) that it was not a star due to it&#39;s brightness.  At first we thought it was a standard civilian aircraft but there were no flashing lights and it was not moving.  As we drove closer we saw that it was clearly a floating object in the sky.  We got closer and we could clearly see the craft from the underside, it was a rounded triangular shape with three very distinct pure white lights forming from the center out to the points of the craft with one blinking red light between back two lights.  The lights had no halo as you would see on any other lights that we would know of, I could clearly see the edges of the craft beyond the lights.  It was close enough to the car that we had to strain our necks to get a good enough angle to look up at it.  The only point of reference that we had to the height that it was flying was a near by radio tower that had one light at the top. My best estimate for how high it was flying was anywhere from 50 to 300 feet above ground.  As soon as we passed the object we decided to pull the car over and see what was happening.  We got out of the car and no more than two second after we exited the vehicle we looked at the craft when it hovered for less than a second and sped away from a dead stop covering a span of many miles in a very short amount of time.  We were outside of the car for (our most generous estimate)no more than ten seconds when we got back in the car.  There were commercial aircraft in the area, most likely in approach to Des Moines.  The object caught up with one of the aircraft almost instantaneously then turned and headed away. My roommate informed me that he looked at the clock in his car before we stopped the vehicle and it read 10:30 p.m., when we got back in the car after ten seconds of being out of it we both looked at the clock! and it read 10:50 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My roommate is a college graduate currently looking into ((deleted)) schools and holding a supervisory position at a local ((deleted)).  I am a current college student anticipating joining the military and earning additional degrees in either ((deleted)) or ((deleted)), then later attending law school.  We both intend to go into politics.  My parents are well grounded people who do not believe in UFO&#39;s, my father is a ((professional)) my mother is a ((professional)).

Investigated by Iowa MUFON,Beverly Trout and Pam Brackenbury.  Described as &#34;rounded&#34; triangle, (hovering when first seen)  on west side of I-35 southbound lanes,near the Truro, Iowa Exit, with no flashing lights, no sound, and close enough that witnesses were viewing the underside of the object, estimated at 50-300 feet in altitutde. (Altitude was estimated based on a nearby radio tower. [NOTE:  There were 3 white triangular-shaped lights (and this is the second case we&#39;ve investigated recently where lights on a triangle are described as triangular in shape instead of circular)with the longer leg of each triangular light following the &#34;outline&#34; of the side of the object (where the light is positioned) rather than being positioned at the apices.] One circular red light is reported between two of the triangular white lights. Witnesses stopped the car as soon as they had passed the object, got out seemingly for perhaps 10 seconds, and were astounded when they got back in the car to discover the car clock now read 10:57 p.m.  [NOTE: This is a time scenario which seems to contradict the 10:13 p.m.time-stamped sales ticket from a Walmart store just before they left to drive the 26 miles to the Truro exit...i.e. it should have taken no more than (at most) 25 minutes to reach the Truro exit, and there is a 44 minute time-span to consider]  When the 2 witnesses got out of their car, in a few seconds the hovering object sped away to the north and &#34;almost instanteously&#34; approached an airliner on approach to the Des Moines Airport, then turned and headed away.  Only one of the 2 witnesses was interviewed, the other witness was out of town and has not contacted investigators to set up an interview - and this is often the case where one witness is willing to talk, but a second witness may be somewhat hesitant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Beverly Trout and Pam Brackenbury, of MUFON/IOWA, for following up on the case, and for their follow-up report.

I think the event lasted less then 5 seconds. The lights had the image/shape of two stars. One stood lower than the other. It made no sound. At that time I was walking on the street with two familymembers. They were looking the other way and didn&#39;t see it. the sky was divided with some low hanging clouds and bright parts. Much higher I also saw and heard many planes (5 or 6). It looked if they were surching. I wonder if they might have noticed it to. 10 o 15 Min. later I still saw the planes flying around further away going east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen such a thing(s) before.

The street i was on was executive boulevard when i first saw a strange object. In El Paso there are big mountains around the area. I was at a stop light and looked up to the mountain area and thought i was wondering why the radio tower i saw looked slightly big. Now remember it was dark around this time. Then i realized that  it wasnt the radio tower that i usually see up on the mountain. It seemed like a triangular object floating. Ive had a great interest in UFO&#39;s for the past few years but i always knew that if i was ever to report an UFO to anyone that i wanted to make it under the most objective standards. I realized that it couldnt have been a helicopter since there wasnt a sound at all and the outlining shape seemed to be triangular. I do live around a military base called fort bliss and they sometimes fly helicopters but you will always hear them. There was no way it could have been a plane since the flight pattern taken by this object seemed to be straight for a little bit, seemed to have stayed a little stationary and then sort of zig-zagged. Iam not an expert on planes or helicopters but i usually see these things fly a straight path. I thought that this object could have been a blimp but it seemed too low for a blimp. I always have this notion that blimps are flown during day time. Anaways the lights emanating from this object werent too bright. I dont remember the number of lights but they were definiteley blinking. I had another eyewitness who was in a car next to my car. I rolled down my window to ask him if he saw what  i saw. He was perplexed. He said he couldnt believe what he saw and he said he didnt know what it was. I wish i could have stopped to him and maybe talked to him for a little while aobut this experience but there was too much traffic. Anaways i tried to chase this object and when i did i could see it in the horizon for a few more minutes ! and then i just couldnt catch up to it anymore since i would have to take a dirt road to see where this object was going.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Craft shape was hard to decern.  The craft had lights red-blue-yellow which flashed and had white lights on the edges of the craft.  The craft was at an altitude of approximately 500-600 feet above the ground at a distance of approx 1-2 miles I think.  It was hard to judge distance.  There was no sounds that I could hear.  There was no wind. Air temp. was approx 20F.  There were stars out.  The craft apparently was hovering since it was not moving in any direction.  My two dogs where very restless and were angerly growling towards the same direction as the craft.  I watched the craft for about 3-5 minutes trying to see a shape or rule out other explainations such as aircraft or a star or planet.   However, there was no movement, no sounds, and the lights did not strobe like that of an aircraft. There was no vapor trail that I could see.  I went into the house to get the camcorder to zoom in on the craft and film it.  I was in the house for approx 5 minutes. When I returned, the craft was gone.  I have not seen it since, however a nieghbor approx. 1 1/2 miles away did see the same craft on the same night at the exact same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I looked I saw in the clear night sky a stationary object that was changing colors from white to red to blue.  It was stationary but as I kept watching it, it got brighter as it got down in the atmosphere until it looked like a very very bright object changing colors in the western sky.  It was approximately 30,000-40,000 feet up in the sky (comparing to an airplane at that height in the daytime sky)and it would move quickly from left to right, up then down, then it would return to a stationary position.  I watched it for about 45 minutes then it began going up in the sky at a fast rate.  It would first go northward, then it would shift position and go west making a sharp 90 degree angle as it went up.

I looked behind, in front and on the sides of me but nothing was there. Then all the lights in my car ( the ones on the dashboard that light when your doors are open, when you need oil, etc.) The light stayed for about 3 to 5 minutes and then as quickly as it came it was gone. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like that in my life. That night i had a dream that I was being abducted by aliens and they kept calling me mean names like ((deleted)) and things of that nature. They also experimented on me in this dream. All my friends thought I really got abducted but I think they&#39;re nuts.

It was accompanied by 3 blinking red lights which we decided were jets because we could hear their engines. The jets did not stay in any formation with it but moved around craft. When it was directly overhead we realized that it was a triangle shape.  After it reached a certain point South West of us it apparently turned (trees were in our way) and began to head in a West to East direction. At that time we lost sight of it.<n>

Within a 15 minute period we seen 3 brightly lit objects appear to come from this sattelite, there was a space of about 5-8 minutes between each light, they would head in a slow southerly direction and each one would gradually become dim and fade out, the skies eventually clouded over ending our observations.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first we thought it may be a star but have never seen it before.  After observing the object for several hours it would suddenly disappear.  This piqued our curiosity.  We have seen it only on very clear nights...it begins to appear around 17:00 and disappears at varying times.  We finally tried to view it through our binoculars and then the telescope...Our best picture, of the one closest to us, was captured on video tape about a week ago....Last night was the first clear night since the video was taken so we took a picture with my camera.  We also saw it land on the hill directly behind the house but it is not close enough to check it out.  We live in the country with a canyon behind our house.  They appear to move and disappear and then reappear later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The video tape show bright flashing lights of many colors and does appear to move just as we witnessed with our telescope.  The camera showed something completely different.  It showed two objects...one that looks like a giant spider but with only 4 legs and the bright light looks like it has a light field in front of it.  Very strange objects...have no idea what it is....Has anyone else reported a sighting such as this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been observing a &#34;twinkling&#34; star, but that is only a guess.

The report was of 20+ objects circling one another in a funnel until they disappeared into the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, again today I was outside on the trampoline with my two sons. We like to watch the planes as they pass over from time to time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw am airliner coming south (toward Atlanta) leaving a condensation trail. As we watched it, a craft came out of the west heading east and passed over us. It was white and I was able to discern that it had no wings and was sort of half-moon shaped. What struck me was the speed of this object. In the 20 seconds I observed it went from one horizon to the other and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The airliner wasn&#39;t even over our heads by the time this thing was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound and left no trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t tell how high it was. It was a good distance up, but not as high as the airliner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple of minutes later we saw a jet or two fly over. They were going faster than the airliner, but couldn&#39;t hold a candle to the speed the UFO displayed. They were also leaving condensation trails (not chem-trails).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Overall the speed, shape, silence, and no trail made this object stick out like a sore thumb to me. Again I was in no position to run inside the house and retrieve my video camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think I&#39;ll make a habit of taking it outside with me from now on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. I called the local newspapers and law enforcement and was told that no one reported anything like what we saw last month.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I watched, a object flew view. I noticed it right away because it was so bright. Also, the 5 seconds I saw it, I couldnt tell it was any vehicle I knew that flew. I ran downstairs and out to the front porch to see if I could continue to see the craft. The craft was visible for about 15 seconds more before it flew behind some trees. I was flying a northwest direction towards downtown Seattle. It was over Lake Washington for the time I witnessed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was partly cloudy, but the sun was bright in the west about 30 minutes before setting, so it was very bright. The craft was oval as I could tell and silver in color. What cought my eye was the very bright white lights on the bottom of the craft. Ther were two lights on the bottom pulsing left to right and back again. I have never seen a light so bright on any craft except a large airliner that is coming straight at you, but this craft was flying diagnally away from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the craft went behind some trees, I saw a sesna flying about the same elevation and distance in the western sky. I think there is a great chance that pilot saw the object I saw. I think that plane was going to land at Boeing field. I hope some other people saw this because it was so bright that time of day and the lights on the craft were so bright. Also the area I live in is densely populated and some had to be looking up besides me. There was absolutly no sound that came from the craft either, which was very weird. The area I saw it in is also not a flight path for aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work for a horticultural company on Mercer Island as supervisor to exterior installs.

Upon closer observation, I noticed that it was moving.  It appeared in the north/western sky and was amber in color.  It moved back and forth and up and down in an erratic pattern.  I was not sure what I was seeing so I called my husband upstairs to observe it.  He thought it was a helicopter or plane, but the lights did not really appear to blink and I have never seen either of those aircrafts move like this one did.  My husband lost interest and returned to watch the playoff game downstairs.  I stayed and decided to get a better look from by porch.  While I was outside, the light slowly started to descend out of my view, down past the tree line.  I live up on a hill off of Route 63.  This light appeared to be near/over Route 8, but I could be wrong, because it was so far away.  Both my husband and I are educated and &#34;normal&#34; people who do not give much notice to these sorts of things.  If anyone else has noticed this light, I&#39;d love to see your comments.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a moonless sky before sunrise.  At least I do not remember seeing the moon. I saw three white or yellowish white lights moving slowly from the west to the east in a triangular formation at an undeterminable altitude and velocity.  I assumed that these lights were all part of one object because they did not move in relation to each other (their triangular pattern remained stable).  There was no red flashing red light that is typically seen with aircraft at night nor was there a sound of a jet or propeller engine nor was there the chopping sound of the rotary blades of a helicopter.  There was no apparent sound at all.  The light formation was close enough so that if I extended my hand that the two outer lights could just be seen on either side of my index finger.  The lack of red flashing lights is what captured my attention and inclined me to get a better look.  I was indoors when I first saw it but I went out doors within less than a minute of first seeing it and watched it move east disappearing into the eastern sky.  When I got out doors it was still close enough to still clearly make out three lights.  Several minuets later as the sun was coming up I saw an airplane moving in exactly the opposite direction with the typical red flashing light and propeller engine sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assume it could be some type of military air craft.<n>

I saw a distant object in my windshield that I initially thought to be a hot air balloon in the distance.  The sky was clear and without clouds.  I found it strange to see a hot air balloon as the temperature was only 4 or 5 degrees above zero.  I noticed the shape of the object change so that I no longer recognized the hot air balloon shape.  I mentioned it to my wife who started watching it also.  It then went back to looking like a hot air balloon.  As we continued to watch it became apparent to me that we were closing on the object faster than I would have expected if it were a hot air ballooon.  My first explanation for this was that perhaps it was smaller than I had expected so we were really closer to it than I had estimated.  As we continued to get closer I realized we were closing on it very quickly and as it passed overhead my wife was able to crane her neck and look up through the windshield.  I asked her what it looked like as we passed and she said that what she saw was a disk shaped object, metalic in color, and not entirely smooth.  The object did not have lights.  At the closest point the object appeared about the size of a quarter.  After the experience we tried to make some sense of what we had seen and have not been able to do so.  I don&#39;t know if the object was large and traveling at a high rate of speed, or if it was small and moving very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was looking due west over the rooftop of the neighboring house. I saw the moon on the left (full moon) and to the right of the moon I saw three &#34;stars&#34; that were blinking. All three were twinkling blue/white. They all appeared equally bright. As I was looking at the three &#34;stars&#34; (which were lined up in a &#34;v&#34; or &#34;isosceles triangular&#34; formation, and two of them were exactly lined up from north to south), I noticed that the &#34;star&#34; lowest to the ground somehow was moving in a downward motion. It slowly dropped straight down until it was behind my neighbor&#39;s roof and I could not see it any more. The other two remained stationary, and as I had to hurry to work, I could not stay longer to watch. Interestingly, another member of my household saw a larger group of very similar UFOs on 7/15/01 (see reference in database) in the exact same spot over the neighbor&#39;s rooftop, but at a different time of the day and exhibiting different behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Viewed with a telescope and binoculars.  Several smaller lights were seen near the main light.  The object appeared to be revolving and appeared to have a beam of light coming from one end. The object appeared to have a slightly green/blue triangular shape.  It appeared to move back and forth, up and down but never drastically.  Also, on 01-09-04 about 4 gray objects appeared to come out of it.  It became visible about 11 PM both nights, but 01-10-04 it seemed to be a little closer.  When viewed with a telescope it appeared as a white orb, no detail, but definately is not a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at Sirius, although that is only a guess.

1/9/04 19:48|Butte|MT|Formation|7-10 minutes|Unusual formation of lights entrances witnesses|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34390.html|220|ndxe200401| Unusual formation of lights entrances witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1948 on Friday, Jan. 9, 2004, my youngest son (15 years) came back into an establishment where I was visiting with my fiancée and a couple of co-workers. My son asked that I go outside to see &#34;something&#34;. On leaving the building I saw my two other sons&#39; and my oldest son&#39;s girlfriend looking skyward. The place we were at is near the airport and I expected to see some type of aircraft or such. Instead, as I looked up at about a 45 degree angle, I saw a group of lights, reddish yellow in color, moving east to west at what appeared to be high altitude and fairly high speed. The apparent &#34;flight&#34; path was east to west (after closer thought, more southeast to northwest), with the majority of the objects moving in random directions within the &#34;flow&#34; of the group, while others followed a more orderly flight formation of two parallel &#34;lines&#34; appearing at arms length to start at about 18 inches wide and maybe an inch separation expanding to maybe 3 feet wide and two inches deep at the end of the sighting (approximately 5- 7 minutes for myself).The random flying objects demonstrated high speed arcing turns, high speed right angle turns, circles and &#34;wiggling&#34; flight. After watching for a couple minutes or so, I grabbed a pair of 7 x 50 binoculars from my vehicle and found that I could not see any detail, just star sized lights moving. Again, the objects were reddish-yellow, perhaps no brighter than other stars and visible due to their movement.  They did not display navigation lights nor leave a contrail. As such, there were no contrails visible in this area of the sky during the time these objects were visible, however, quite a distance south near the southern visible horizon aircraft navigation lights could be clearly seen.  The area of town we were in is a commercial district near the local airport and well lighted, however stars are easily visible during the night  After watching for a few more minutes I returned inside the business and asked my fiancée to step outside on the other side of the building to see if she saw the same thing. Joining her was a co-worker of mine and three other patrons, who immediately saw the same series of objects. The general consensus was’ &#34;this is weird, I wonder what they are?&#34; My interest was much higher as I am familiar with high performance military aircraft flight characteristics. These objects definitely outperformed any aircraft that I have seen or can imagine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After spending about two minutes viewing the objects from this vantage point the group moved back indoors as the outside temperature was around 8 °F. The sky was clear with some ice crystals visible in the glare of the street lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then walked back to the location where my sons were.  We continued to watch for maybe a minute at which time an aircraft departed the airport and the objects looked as though they were forming one large, tight group. We watched the plane for a few moments and noticed that the objects were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe that we saw reflections, birds, ice crystals, weather balloons or conventional aircraft. My family and I have viewed satellites many times and are familiar with satellite flight characteristics. The apparent coordination of the 28+ objects astounded all observers around me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any information related to these objects would interest me greatly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we believed his story to be sincere.  However, despite repeated requests, we have not received any other reports from the other witnesses.  We have no way of knowing whether this is a sincere report, but we would welcome reports from any other witnesses.  PD))<n>

I kept observing it when it moved across the sky turning into a triangle that was orange in color and had 4 lights that were divided in to 4 sections from top to bottom. They light up each section at a time then went off. This one from the eastern sky joined another one that was hovering in the western sky and were side by side. I finally got my husband who saw the same thing as me. we both seen them side by side and i looked through my binoculars and the lights faded slow off and on for a short time then they completly shut off and that was the last time i saw them. Incidentially a friend of mine seen the same thing over the mts of san bernardino the following monday night at around 9 pm and he witnessed 4 of them in a row.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were discussing finances.  I was sitting on a patio chair looking out and he was facing me.  While we were in the middle of a discussion, I saw a light object fly towards the ground and disappear in mid-air.  It had no tail or streak.  It was approx. the diameter of a pinky finger nail at arms distance.  The object seemed to be very close.  Not like a shooting star, but more like a light that would turn on and off from a short distance.  The object appeared in my viewing area going towards the ground and disappeared shortly.  It did not &#34;fade out,&#34; it was as if it was turned off.  The night was clear w/ no clouds in the area.  There was no noise associated with the viewing.  It was a very still and quiet night.  Not sure what it was.  I do know that it was not a shooting star, satellite, or aircraft of terrestial origin.  My boyfriend is an avid star gazer.  We have seen many shooting stars and satellites.  The object seemed so close.  Very weird!!<n>
1/8/04 20:00|Bundaberg (Australia)||Light|10mins|fast hovering lights on the beach|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/059/S59152.html|224|ndxe200401| fast hovering lights on the beach<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello to whoever reads this, this is the story of an event that took place in my life around 3 years. My brother and I were walking along the beach near our parents house at around 20:00 hours. It is not uncommon to be alone on this beach as few people live in the area, this was one of those occasions. We walked only a short distance down from our access to the beach and decided to sit for a while. The low wind and few waves made it very quiet. That was when things took an abnormal turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we sat there talking we notice a light at the end of the point which was about 2kms away. The beach is the shape of a crescent moon, the light was at the left point and we where in the middle. We didn’t take much notice of it at first because 4x4s use that end of the beach frequently, suddenly the light disappeared then reappeared. Of course we where not scared by this, it was only when the light stared to move around the crest of the beach at tremendous speed that it gain our attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Attention turned to alarm as the light drew closer and we could hear no sound of a motor. The light covered the distance from the point to our position in around 20seconds. By this time my brother who is an emotional lad was in hysterics running flat out for the exit. I thought it prudent to follow but curiosity got the better of me and I stopped just before the access, as I turned I saw the light had stopped just before the shore line about 20metres from me. As I stood there I saw that this light did not just face forward but evenly illuminated 5metres around it in every direction. I could also see that there was no physical object holding this light up, it was hovering about 1metre off the ground. I got the distinct feeling that it was aware of my presence and it was using caution.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this stage my brother had left the beach and was screaming at me from down the access to run. My one regret now is that I did not investigate further but I gave in to my brother’s pleas and moved off the beach. The beach rises quite quickly from the water line to the top of a small dune which stretches the length of the beach with a few trees scattered along the ridge. It then descends into a gully, then up again onto another dune. As I caught up with my terrified brother in the gully we turned around to see if the light was following. The light ascended off the beach to a height that it could be seen in the gully, easily 30 feet off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost simultaneously we started moving further down the access and the light descended back on the beach. It then started moving at high speed back the way it came, we know this because we could see the glow along the top of the dune. After a brief period back on the road that leads to the beach access we collected our wits and thought about it sensibly, we realized that it was low tide so any land vehicle would have to have left some sort of track on the beach. So we then proceeded back onto the beach to search physical signs of what we just saw, however nothing could be seen on over a kilometer of beach covered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no man made explanation for what we saw that night. All I know is that it was aware of our presence and exercised some degree of caution indicating intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for reading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I could recognize the exact shape since it was all light. The color was a red with just a little orange. I was with my brother the moment I saw it and rapidly told him to look, but the craft had already dissapeared. It moved at a speed which was never as slow as a plane, it was also moving at a faster speed than a jet. I could say its speed was around half the speed of a shooting star. It moved in a straight line from left to right (from my point of view). It didn&#39;t make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I noticed a large,bright red orange glowing light directly overhead. It was moving west to east slowly. I quickly grabbed my astronomical 11x80 binocs and focused on the object. It was a glowing yellow cylindrical craft, slightly domed on top. The bottom of the craft was flat and was a mass of glowing orange red rockets of an energy source, it pulsated and grew in intensity as they craft moved. The craft wobbled perceptibly and took a horizontal trajectory, all the while the craft itself was a vertical cylinder, three times longer than wide. The craftmoved to the east for several miles at high altitude then turned to the south and proceeded for several miles. It began to drop glowing reddish debris from the rockets or energy source. This behavior continued for several minutes until the craft began to accelerate and it rose in elevation. Suddenly the craft blinked out and the glowing embers stopped. Last january 14 I witnessed exactly the same thing from my house, but at 7PM. That occurence lasted 10 minutes. My wife winessed the craft both times, so I have a good witness. We are mystified.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I swirved off the road as I was trying to get a good look at it. I then pulled over on the 60 freeway going westbound, and just stared at these lights. It was so bright I could not make out what it was, but it was a circle of lights, and it was just sitting still in the sky. I sat there for about 10 minutes, and decided to head on out to work. As I got to work, I started feeling sick, and began to vomit. I decided to go back home, but I did not see the lights when I was heading home. I felt sick for the remainder of the day. I never told anyone of what I had seen. I did not think anyone would believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was sent to me today 1/8/04 by a friend in Ireland: UFOs spotted over North Dublin By ((name #1 deleted)) and ((name #2 deleted)) FINGAL is becoming a ‘hot spot’ for UFO experts and fans with reports of almost 100 incidents of unexplained events last year.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many of them centre around Dublin Airport, with one report exclusively described to the Fingal Independent by the UFO and Paranormal Research Ireland (UPRI), an organisation that monitors the skies of Ireland in search of strange and unexplained ‘aerial phenomena’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Late last year, the organisation received a report from the co-pilot of an airbus who said he had seen an unidentified ‘red disc’ flying in Irish skies after the co-pilot’s flight had taken off from Dublin Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With what the crew said was ‘phenomenal speed that no aircraft could perform,’ the disc shot vertically upwards and disappeared from sight at 7,000ft Twenty seven minutes later, the crew say they overheard a KLM pilot radioing air traffic control at Dublin Airport with a similar report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Irish Aviation Authority checked flight logs for the reported date at both Dublin and Shannon airports but found nothing unusual while a spokesperson from the Pilot’s Association said that none of its members has ever expressed concern over unidentified flying objects in the skies around Dublin Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There have been a number of other incidents, equally as mysterious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One former local aviation writer contacted by the Fingal Independent stated that he did not believe in the whole UFO thing or rarely heard reports of any strange incidents but was the victim of one such experience more than 20 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Liam Byrne was living in River Valley Heights in Swords and, being a keen ‘plane spotter’ was following one 747 across the sky when a strange, bright star appeared within five miles of the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ‘It was a beautiful day and there was not a cloud in the sky. Suddenly, I saw this bright star and I watched it for a couple of minutes. Then it darted right overhead and within half a minute shot southwards towards the Wicklow Hills. I would say it travelled about 30/40 miles in less than two seconds.’ ‘I knew people working in the tower at Dublin Airport and I rang them but they didn’t have any record of what it was. I have never been able to figure it out to this day.’ Mystery still surrounds an incident last September when a garda helicopter was called out to investigate an unidentified flying object over Dublin Airport which resembled a paraglider.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When asked if that was possible the Irish Paragliding Association stated that ‘no one in their right mind would paraglide around the airport.’<n>
1/7/04 22:00|West Hartford|CT|Triangle|10 minutes|2 Trangular Craft Seen|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34372.html|232|ndxe200401| 2 Trangular Craft Seen<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving south on Trout Brook Drive in West Hartford CT around 10 PM on 1/7/2004 and I saw two very bright lights in the sky, hovering and moving slowly about 300 feet above the ground.  As an avid sky watcher, I am familiar with all of the planets and constellations and I know I did not mistake these objects for &#34;Venus&#34; or anything.  The moon was full, high in the sky and the sky was crystal clear.  I thought at first that they might be helicopters, but they were moving in a way that I have never seen a helicopter move...hovering slowly in a sort of circular motion  One of the objects started moving away and I lost sight of it, so I focused on the other.  I had to turn my car around and follow it and it turned from one bright object into a triangular shaped form with three white lights on each corner of the triangle and a few blinking red lights on it.  I pulled my car over to the side of the road, as did a bunch of other people to try to get a better look.  I rolled my window down to see if I could hear anything, but it was completely silent.  If it was a plane or helicopter, it was close enough where I would have definitely heard something.  At this point it was much lower, probably 75-100 feet off the ground.  It hovered and moved slowly and I continued to watch it for another couple minutes until it disappeared behind the tree line and I lost sight of it.  Because of the lighting on the ground, I had a bit of a difficult time trying to decipher the dimensions, but I would have to guess that it was about 20 to 25 feet in length and about 10 feet in height.  It looked like it was black, but being dark, I&#39;m not completely sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Witness is from a &#34;scientific&#34; family, her father being involved in atomic research during the WW II era.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 7Jan04 at about 7:30PM, witness was enroute home, driving through her neighborhood. The witness indicated she had been enjoying the beautiful weather and full moon and as she prepared to turn onto her street she noticed overhead a set of bright lights beginning to glide past. She added that she was caught off guard by this, and upon looking closer noticed that the lights were attached to the bottom of a LARGE DARK TRIANGULAR CRAFT (WUFOD &#34;Actual Size&#34; data field entry indicating 101-300 feet).<n> <n><n> <n><n> She continued watching, then turned onto her street, keeping it in sight. Witness&#39; stated that her first impression was a LARGE &#34;stealth type&#34; craft. She described the craft as being VERY LOW in altitude (treetop), with no sound noticed (vehicle windows rolled up). Witness indicated that it was low enough that she had no trouble observing a &#34;suction cup&#34; like configuration around the steady white lights, one in the middle and also one on each corner, totalling four. At that point, it was traveling parallel to her and a little bit ahead (appx. 40mph). She sped up, but it appeared to be going a bit faster than her vehicle. The craft then began to ascend, it banked slightly to the left, and departed the scene. Simultaneous to the above, the witness was attempting to get out her cell phone in order to summon her friend to run outside and look skyward, but the phone was dropped onto the floorboard. She noticed two neighbors outside at the end of the street and intends on speaking with them ASAP. Within a few minutes, the witness arrived home and called the local police, Atlanta&#39;s Channel 11 (NBC) and Atlanta&#39;s Fernbank Science Center........all to no avail, as they had no information or additional reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As with all such preliminary reports carried in &#34;MUFONGA Updates&#34;, this case requires additional scrutiny in order to vet the witness and attempt to determine the cause. This witness has agreed to a sit-down with our investigators and the case is in the process of being assigned to SSD/FI David Brown of Norcross.<n> <n><n> <n><n> David Brown, MUFONGA&#39;s State Section for the NE area of the greater metro Atlanta area, did in fact contact this witness.  She agreed to meet with him on 10Jan04 to complete the paperwork, make a statement, and provide a sketch of what was observed.  David found the witness was indeed employed in a managerial position on the staff of a world renowned Atlanta area university. Said facility having a history of close association and participation in technical government projects and various scientific disciplines. Witness was ascertained to be a well educated person, and seemed to be very concise and observant. She repeated her account in person to David and during this detailed debriefing, added additional details as to what occurred.  The duration of the event was about 5 minutes, occurring as the witness drove through her neighborhood, made a few turns, and all the while keeping the object in view.  It dissappeared for a  brief few moments, but the terrain and direction of travel brought it back into clear view.  She added that it was just over the treetops, which was determined by FI Brown to be flying at about 150 feet in altitude. Shortly before it banked and departed the area, she got a good view of the underside.  The witness stated to David Brown that there was a LARGE ROUND white light at each corner and one in the center, seemingly like FLOURESCENT TUBES, with a surrounding structure that made them appear like &#34;SUCTION CUPS&#34;.  While the triangle was dark, it did seem to be of the gray shade (it was that close and well lighted).  She noticed no sound, but her windows were up and the radio  playing. Weather was clear, about 35 degrees, calm, CAVU.<n> <n><n> <n><n> FI Brown&#39;s follow-up included contacting the Police Department which verified that she had called to report the event, but that no officer was dispatched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Atlanta&#39;s Channel 11 (NBC) did not refer any other witnesses to MUFONGA during that time frame, nor were any concurrent similar events reported directly to this SD.  FI Brown also spoke with PIO personnel at Dobbins AFB which is about 25 miles west of the event location, also authorities at Atlanta&#39;s Hartsfield Airport. They provided no information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> MUFONGA has considered in this case, a fly-over of the much discussed/rumored experimental government &#34;lighter than air&#34; craft. No blazing speed or incredible manuevers were reported in this event.......BUT......why would such a &#34;legitimate&#34; (though possibly experimental) aircraft be flying at treetop level over a densely populated area at night?  Crew training?  Equipment testing? Operational/navigation training?

I then saw a black ball about 1/3 the size of the jet approach at a very high speed from the east. I thought I was seeing a missle heading for the jet. Then the object stopped, and began following the jet !  At that point I said to my friend, &#34;what the hell is that&#34;? He replied, a UFO! The object followed the jet for about 5 seconds, then the object split into 2 objects!(Horizontally or left and right)  These objects were half the size of the original ball, and looked either white or metallic, as they now looked to have the same reflectivity as the jet. We watched these two smaller spheres follow the jet for approx. 5 more seconds until the three objects traveled out of our range of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I pointed it out to my aunt and she said that it was a plane, and I remember telling her that it was offly bright, unless we just got a view of it where the sun was reflecting off of it or something.  But then, about 10 seconds later, it was further away and the brightness of it faded, and then it was gone.  The whole sighting of whatever this thing was was less than 20 seconds.  It could have been some sort of aircraft of ours, but I have never heard of anything, WE have invented that moves that fast; it was gone without a trace before we had a chance to try to follow it across the sky with out eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Only colors were bright white. Unearthly type speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom told me before she left to eventually let my dog out of his inside cage because she new if I didnt he would have an accident in it. At approximately 6:30 PM, I put my dog on his leash and I took hime outside so that he could go to the bathroom. While he was going to the bathroom I glanced around the night sky like usual, except I noticed a bright light that looked like either an extremely bright star or a ufo. At first, I really thought it was a star so I almost didnt bother going to get my binoculars but I was intrigued by it very much, so I decided to go get them out of my room anyway. Before I took my dog inside and myself, I focused on the position of the ufo in the night sky, therefore I would know whether it moved or not when I came back. The ufo/star was above the trees in my woods and to the north. I quickly ran into my room and snatched my binoculars, as fast as I possibly could. Once I arrived again into the garage, I put on my dogs leash and we both ventured back outside to see what I thought, at that point, was a ufo/star. Once outside the door, I noticed that the ufo/star was still to the north but below the trees in my woods. It had definitely moved significantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I decided it was time to look out through the binoculars at the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was startled by the objects appearance, it looked to me like a huge white ball in the night sky. Though I wasnt convinced it was a ufo until the object changed shape into a triangle looking object. I noticed this when I wasnt looking through my binoculars, the object went from a very bright plasma looking light, to were it looked like a strange looking dim star in the night sky. I now really realized something strange was up there. I took another peek through my binoculars and the bright ball of illuminated light was now in the form of a triangle type shape.It constantly was shifting from ball of light to the triangle type shape. Another bizarre instance with this object was that I&#39;d be looking at it and all of a sudden you would lose it. I remember taking off my binoculars to see if it disappeared or if it moved. Sure enough the object moved so fast that while I was peering through my binoculars I didnt even notice its quick movement. The object didnt move far when it did this it just moved beyond my ability to see it do so. This object stayed to the north the whole sighting, it just was constantly in different places. After this point, I was almost positive this was a ufo. I stayed out there from approximately 6:30 to 7:28. At 7:28 PM, I went inside because the object suddenly disappeared while I was looking at it through my binoculars. It was absolutely incredible, the object was gone before I could even blink an eye, I almost dropped my binoculars, I was stunned by how fast it disappeared. The object moved faster than anything I&#39;ve ever seen move on Earth. After this experience, I took another quick look out into the night sky to see if it appeared anywhere else, but it was gone. I&#39;m totally positive this was a true ufo sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

After a few minutes, it stopped mid-air. After sitting there for a couple seconds, I couldn&#39;t see the blinking lights any more and it began moving straight and then right over my house. The lights that were facing me when it was going straight up were now on the bottom of the UFO, so I believe the UFO was rising with the nose in the air. We watched it until it was out of sight. It was heading North West. Also, my dogs were freaking out the whole time it was near.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I saw these while at a friends bbq and there were about six of us who witnessed it.  We even tried to video tape it but it didn&#39;t work out.  It was in the middle of the night I think it was of January of 2004 I was on winter break from college.  It was probably around 8 PM and we saw a flashing red object which was very bright in the sky.  At first we all thought it was a star but it was way to large and close to us to be one.  I thought it was a missle because it appeared to be moving and thought it was coming towards us.  We were all really skeptical until the object started moving in another direction.  People were saying it was an airplane but no airplane moves that quickly and can move in a variety of different directions at that speed.  The object moved up and down and left and right.  An airplane could not do that.  The red object also hovered in the sky for a while then elevated it self higher into the sky.  Definitely not an airplane.  As the object flew higher it came closer to the moon and pretty much covered it in the night sky.  It was at this point that maybe six or more smaller triangular aircrafts flew out of it.  The small aircrafts flew right beneath and scattered all over the sky and it had to be a scatter of 10 miles in diameter.  These small triangle aircrafts also flashed  red lights and flew all over the place way to fast and agile to be an airplane or jet.  After a while we all saw helicopters and we thought they were government helicopters but it seemed very out of place to me.  Helicopters out of no where near Newark, New Jersey, very strange.  The helicopters were black and seemed dark since it was at night.  The strange thing was that the two helicopters look like they were tracking the red flashing objects in the sky but as soon as those helicopters came out chasing them the red flashing objects simply disappeared.  After the red flashing triangle like aircrafts disappeared the black helicopters hung around for a while using spot lights.  They even got close to the house we were in. They had to be only a few miles up in the air.    We all just thought of it as nothing but its really hard not to admit it.  We never talked about it again.  I assume that it was government related and if not that then it was definitely something foreign and not of this world.  I definitely know we weren&#39;t all seeing things because we turned on the radio and people in northern NJ area reported the Flashing red lights on 1010 winds i think its called . (The AM radio station channel).  Also down the street was a restaurant filled with people coming out to the parking lot after eating dinner who all witnessed the flying objects as well.  I am going to write another report since I witnessed these same objects a second time more recently in April of 2006 in Washington, D.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was South-west in the sky and about half again as high above the downtown buildings as the planes after they level off from Sky Harbor. In fact we watched several commercial liners and a helicopter fly in the approximate area of the sky only lower during this &#34;sighting&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Basically it was caught our eye because it was so big and so bright-it grew dimmer very gradually till it just faded out from view about 10 minutes after I left the car to go into the store-on my way in-I showed a clerk to look up at it-and she tried to figure out what she was seeing as well.  There were no blinking lights, just one bright white light about 10 times brighter and larger than any typical star in the sjy-but there were no other stars in the sky at the this time. The light never appeared to move-just faded out. It seemed to just &#34;hang&#34; there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness intended a date in 2004, not 2003.

The light appeared to back up a little bit then it began to slowly descend at a downward angle towards the ground into the woods behind my house.  I could tell it was behind the trees as I saw the branches and trunks in front as it descended very slowly. It&#39;s normally pitch black here at night so I know it was not a reflection from a streetlight or car.  And there are no neighbors or airports closeby. I never believed in UFOs....until now.

Arizona numerous sightings of up to six objects at a time and low altitude chase<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area around Arivaca, Ariz. is well know by locals for wierd activity in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We commonly see objects from low to high level and witnessed one chased by two F-16 fighters. The object played with them out turning and out accelerating then slowing and letting them catch up then off he would go again. This went on for about 10 min. The fighters had to break off as they were under afterburner for most of the chase and had to be running low on fuel. Then the object shot straight up out of sight. We watched part of the show with Owl night vision glasses with magnification of 4X. The object, when watched by eye turned red-white-green repeatedly and was disc shaped.  What I am also reporting here are other sightings at higher altitude. When in the Arivaca area we have sat out at night and watched objects entering and exiting the atmosphere in  E.- W. N.-S. and S.-N. directions. Possibly going in and out of to Area 51? One night we watched six of them come in about 5 min apart on a S.-N. approach, except the last one was about 10 min later than #5. He skipped twice on the atmosphere we could see the flash and what appeared to be a short trail from the heat before he entered successfully and we watched as he followed the same route as the first five while slowly loosing altitude. We joked that he must have stopped at another party and had a bit of a problem with his drinking and driving. This is not the first time we have watched the high altitude objects that were clearly not planes or satallites. We have observed them changing directions 3 and 4 times in a period of 1-2 min. and then fly out in space until we couldn&#39;t see them any more with binoculars or have watched them come down to lower altitudes, you can tell when thay are dropping as they lose the suns reflection and are not as bright. I don&#39;t particularly want any type of chance contact. We have enough Illegal Aliens coming in from Mexico and causing problems without these. If anyone wants to take notice just get up in the mountains or out on the desert around Arivaca and keep your eyes open at night for high flying objects that emit no sound. Seldom have I gone a week without observing at least one of them-especially in the summer, of course thats when I normally sit out most of the time. Nights when the moon is down are the best but there seems to be more traffic when the moon is half or fuller making the objects more difficult to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report, but it seems curious that NUFORC has received no other reports of this apparently dramatic event.  We would welcome other reports from anyone in the area who might have been witness to the event.  PD))<n>

We were stopping for gas when the driver of the car commented on &#34;the really bright stars&#34; that had appeared about 45 min before the sun was ready to set. The objects seemed to be moving... so, stuck in the back seat of a civic in the middle of the desert, I had little else to pay attention to. Within minutes, one of the objects (which was first a bright light, then a cigar shape) turned red very suddenly, and it appeared to have exploded. Excited, I yelled to my friend (who had first dismissed the objects as weather balloons), who then, nervouse, watched intently with me as the first object began to fall, while the second object, still white light untill this point, turned a bright red and appeard to hover about the mountain range adjacent to interstate 40 south bound. The object started to do several other bizarre things, like break out into a lateral acceleration that must have covered 50 miles within seconds, stop, turn colors, lift into the sky and return to it&#39;s low altitude, go in reverse immidiatly with rapid speed, then rocket off again. After reaching the near-end of the mountain range, the view opened up, after which we were all shocked to see the object we had observed &#34;meet up&#34; with 5-6 more just like it, but each one was a varying intensity of red light (kind of how closer stars are brighter vs. farther stars at night time).All of these objects demonstrated thier agility and handling just as the first. One by one, the objects were either dissappearing behind trees/hills/poles or literally vanishing into thin air. We saw several other objects that were clearly airplanes and helicopters during the rest of our drive that evening, but absolutly nothing like the red lights on the mountains. We attempted to take photographs of these objects with a Kodak Max disposable camera, but the lights did not appear through the view finder of the camera when we were making the snapshots. When I develop! the film, if there are images, I will gladly scan/email or snailmail them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I am desperately seeking a logical explanation for what my husband and I saw, so I am trying all avenues. My husband and I were sitting on the lanai around 7:00pm Hawaiian time on Monday, January 5, 2004. On our visits to Maui we spend a good amount of time out there watching whales, sunrises, sunsets, stars, planes etc. It was our last hour before we had to go to the airport for our trip back to the East Coast of the US. The sun had been down for a good amount of time and venus shone very brightly. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright light that I initially assumed was a plane....but it was glowing bright orange. I am horrified of flying, so I thought that maybe the plane was on fire or had exploded, but we hadn&#39;t heard any noise. I pointed it out to my husband whose reaction was &#34;that&#39;s not right.&#34;  We continued to watch it for about ten minutes, I even had time to go into the condo, unpack my camera, change lenses, come back out and take a couple pictures. Unfortunately, I had had my camera set for a long exposure, so the pictures aren&#39;t any good....convenient, I know. So anyway, it continued a path directly in front of our condo, it didn&#39;t seem to be at a very high altitude. Here is why I am having trouble finding a logical explanation:  It travelled very slowly, it was a constant glowing orange color in an orb shape, it maintained altitude and eventually made a slight ascent, and it made absolutely no noise. I cannot wrap my brain around it. It could not have been something on fire like a plane or something burning up upon reentering the atmosphere because wouldn&#39;t that have moved in a downward motion, moved faster, had a comet-like tail, had debris breaking off, changed in color or made some type of noise? I also do not believe that it could have been wind shear and sun reflection. The sun had been down for too long, the object was not that high in the sky, there was no slight variations in ! color li ke a reflection, and the angle of the reflection would be impossible. Any other expanation, I would welcome with open arms!<n>

The very things I saw with my two friends just two nights ago have had amazingly similar sightings posted on this page for months if not years, and I can&#39;t understand why there are still no answers. It shouldn&#39;t have to come from private ufo investigators, either. Either the government is involved or at the very least aware; and damn it I want answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A car with 3 kids of college jr/sr age, all born and raised in an affluent suburb in upstate NY, attending highly ranked 4 year institutions... (and extreemly sober, might I add) felt helpless, scared and shocked by what they viewed in the dusk hours off of some stupid highway in the desert, like a bad sci fi movie. These people reporting stuff from thier trailers in the desert were just funny steriotypes to us; characters in movies. But instead we found ourselves in thier shoes- out alone with the wide open sky making you feel good about life, untill suddenly a &#34;what the hell is that&#34; gets blurted out, redirecting the focus of the evening drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although I have been a &#39;legal&#39; adult for some time now, I worried at first that  my age would affect my credibility... until I read those other earlier reports. Now I&#39;m just mad. I&#39;m still conditioned to think that we are a great, powerful and fair country; concerned for it&#39;s citizens because we are benevolent in nature. Why hasn&#39;t the governmnet 1. investigated this or 2. released a statement/issued a security warning/expose a hoax that is obviosly being noticed by and making more than several people feel uncomfortable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For every extreemly random person such as myself that viewed an incident and happened to fall upon your web page, there must be at least 10 more who eiter tried to dismiss what they saw or do not have access to or knowledge of the existence of this forum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am freaked out with a capitol F.  ((initals deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that many of the unexplained lights seen over Arizona, and elsewhere in the U. S., probably have prosaic answers as to what they are caused by.  In the case of Arizona, SOME of the lights may be artificial illumination used during military exercises.

1/5/04 17:30|Seligman (near)|AZ|Cigar|10 minutes|Cigar Shaped objects east of Seligman, AZ on I40 East|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34321.html|254|ndxe200401| Cigar Shaped objects east of Seligman, AZ on I40 East<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 17:30 hours on 01/05/04 myself and two others were sitting at a gas station in my car filling up i&#39;d say roughly about 40-50 miles east of Seligman, AZ when I noticed 2 white/gray cigar shaped objects hovering one above the other over the mountain range north of us.  I looked at them briefly and assumed they were weather balloons and turned away.  A split second later my friend screamed at me and said   &#34;oh my god, one of them just exploded&#34;, to which I turned back and saw that the second cigar shaped object hovering at the lower altitude had turned bright red and began to fall from the sky towards the mountain range.  About half way through the fall object number two disappeared.  After that I saw object number 1 which was also white/gray in color turn a bright red and lower itself in altitude so it was only slightly hovering over the mountain range.  At this point I determined this was neither an airplane or a weather balloon. By this time we were back in the car driving east on the I40.  I then saw object number one fly lateral with the mountain range across an incredible amount of distance at an amazing speed.  I estimate that it moved across 75 degrees of mountain range in roughly 5-10 seconds.  The cigar shaped object appeared to be approximately 1/10-1/20 the diameter of the moon.  It then disappeared when it hit the end of the mountain range and we were all in shock in the car.  We then drove for about 5 more minutes when we looked back at the end of mountain range and saw 6 bright red cigar shaped objects appear in a circular fashion for about 3-5 seconds and then disappear.  We never saw anything after that.  It was an extemely desolate area and I believe we were the only ones on the road.  We took pictures hanging out from the car but I am not sure if they came out.  They are currently being developed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

My computer room has a large window through which I first saw the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 17:10 I was distracted by flashing lights outside.  It was already dark, pretty much full-on night.  I glanced through the window to my right and saw what I first thought was a hellicoper making a slow progress above the trees.  The object was unusual though, because it was arrayed with a row or two of flashing white lights that were remniscent of emergency lights -- the kind that police vehicals use.  The difference being that these were white, and seemed to be all over  the &#34;helicoptor&#34;.  There was no spotlight and the object made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had come from the northwest and was moving south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowed to a stop and started going in reverse, northward.  That was when I pointed it out to my girlfriend who was sitting to my right.  It then tilted one of its points towards us and started a lazy circle, revealing a triangular shape.  At two apexes were were alternating red lights, with the flashing white lights on the bottom.  In the center of the tirangle was one slowly flashing larger red light.  I could not discern a light at the third corner, but sometimes thought I saw a bright white light flashing there as well.  It seemed that the pattern of flashing lights changed as the craft moved in different ways.  The lights often changed between white and red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> at 17:11 the craft had completed its circle and was hovering over an area about four blocks away to the southwest of my location It was about the size of a silver dollar at arms length and seemed to be hovering,  I would estimate at between 200-400 feet up.  It then performed a funny little twist.  While hovering, it rotated so that it now hovered on what I would have called it&#39;s tail.  My girlfriend and I agreed that this did not look like any kind of helicoptor we had heard of.  She said it could have been some form of super-light airplane.  I dont know how it would maintain any lift while hold still though.  We both agreed that it seemed to be stationary. It began hovering to the north and rotated so that the &#34;front&#34; point was now level and facing north.  It then picked up a lot of speed and flew out of sight.  It seemed to accellerate very fast and was out of sight within 4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> at 17:13 I picked up my camera and went outside hoping for it to reappear.  It almost immediately came back into view, flying this time from the west.  I listened carefully for any sound.  I could hear the faint sound of a proppeller plane, but it seemed very distant and faint. The object went to and hovered over the same area as before and began moving back and forth.  After a minute of this, it began to move slowly back to the north.  My camera&#39;s bateries were too low, so I could not get a pciture of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some neighbors were walking up the path from the parking lot and looked at what I was trying to photograph.  It was a man a woman and a small boy (named Andy).  The man immediately commented that it looked like a UFO to him.  (But he said UMB because his english isn&#39;t that great.)  I asked if he meant UFO, and he said yes.  I told him it was probably jsut a weird plane, and they went inside.  I didn&#39;t want to look like a crazy person taking pictures of ufo&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon it picked up speed at an alarming rate and was gone again within seconds.  I could still hear the distant propeller plane sound, which seemed to be coming from the south. I went inside to look for camera bateries.  I went back out to watched the sky for a while and it did not return, so I went back inside. I could not keep myself from glancing out the window every few seconds hoping to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then at 20:09 I saw a triangular arrangement of yellowish-white lights, much farther away, moving in from the north to the south.  I was about to go outside to take a pciture, and the object disappeared before my eyes. About two hours later I decided that the most obvious explanation was that the object went into an unseen cloud.  It is possible, but it truly just winked out instantly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This could have been some type of silent helicopter festooned with about a dozen flashing lights and having really awesome manuverability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will email you a map of my area showing the path that the object seemed to be going in, with my location marked on it.  I&#39;ll also send you some photos of my view, with overlaid drawings of what I saw (as soon as I can get my camera working).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lady said it was almost completely dark out when she spotted it just above the horizon over one of the local hills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A short contrail, coral red in color. She mentioned if it had of been light out she may have been able to see the body of the craft, or something that may have been making the colored contrail. But because of the time of day, and being almost pitch black out she could not see what was causing the contrail. The witness said it was very bright, defined trail. The lady said she didn&#39;t believe it was very high up in the sky and the object did not have any flashing strobe lights on it. It traveled on a steady, straight path not making any unusual moments as it flew along. The witness said she observed it for approx: a couple of minutes and then she walked back into the store. The object was still visible at the time she stopped watching it. So we have no idea just how long the lady would have been able to observe it for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

He and his wife went to see a movie. When they returned, My brother in law Anthony offhandedly told me about some lights he saw in the sky immediatly after leaving my house for the movie. They were in a hurry because the movie was starting soon, but they stopped at the stop sign and looked up and they described seeing a hundred or so small lights kind of in an upsidedown swoosh formation. He said, and his wife Misty coroborated him, that the formation drifted slowly from easrt to west for about fifteen seconds while they stared at it. Then it slowly turned north and started morphing into more of an upsidedown U for about 3-5 more seconds before dissapearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the lights vanished they spotted an airplane flying eastbond for DIA traveling signifigantly faster than the light formation did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a dark cloudless night and we are over the ridge from Denver so we are sheltered somewhat from it&#39;s ground light. There are also no streetlights on my steet so nights are dark and starry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My personal opinion is it was something natural floating in the air, due to it&#39;s slow movement. Exhaust from an airplane, the after effects of a meteor, or a firework.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((male name deleted and Misty say it appeared to be as high or higher than the plane was.

I realized that what I was seeing was in the northern sky. I looke east and saw the moon. I came in the house and got the binoculars and looked out of the kitchen window. What I was was extremely large. It was a gold-silver color. It was saucer shaped with a definite dome on the top. It was hovering in the sky. It had flashing lights at the top,bottom and on the left side. I went outside to get a better look. after looking through the binoculars for a few seconds, I ran back inside and got a video camera and telephone to call for others to come out and see the object. I was able to get the object on videotape. After a few minutes of watching the object, it began to move very slowly to the east where it went behind some trees and out of sight.

Besides reporting lights for January 4, 2004 he also told me he witnessed bright lights on January 1, 2004. He went on to explain there is no service roads, or roads of any kind up on the mountain. The witness said there also is a large canyon which cuts through the mountain side where some of these lights were being observed. The fellow ruled out any kind of vehicle due to the roughness of the terrain and again the lights were traveling over the tree line. He said there was not a sound coming from the lights, as his home is close enough to where he would have heard if the object was a helicopter or other type of aircraft. Also seeing it was after dark and traveling so very low a pilot would have been crazy to fly an aircraft at such a low altitude in hazardous conditions. The lights were not traveling at a fast clip, but moving slowly. When the man decided to run and grab his binoculars and came back out on his deck, the lights had vanished. As he thought back he thinks that there were more lights on the one bright object. At one point the light traveled down the mountain through the canyon towards his direction which was to the north. As it drew closer to the lower part of the mountain it turned to the west and of course disappeared soon after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two years earlier the fellow and his girlfriend saw similar lights on the mountain at approx: 10:00 p.m., but this time the lights seem to hug the mountain as they flew slowly along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for his report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike for submitting this report.

As we passed Carlos Bee we saw 1 object in the sky coming from the south about 100ft above the street and surounding buildings. At first we thought it might be a loose balloon from one of the many car dealerships that line the street. There was no wind and the object was larger than the balloons, it was white and egg shaped. The light reflected off of it but not a flashy or metallic type of reflection. The object moved northboound just over us as we drove southbound. It was about the 5 feet in diameter at it&#39;s thinnest point. Then I saw 2 more objects, about 3/4 that size. I decided to stop and pull over to look and grab my camera. They were also egg shaped but grey, non-mettalic. The white egg shape then changed shape slightly into a smoothened diamond like shape about 200ft above and North of me. The two grey craft stopped in mid-air and the white craft joined them briefly in a delta formation over our heads. The white craft then again sped off towards the north a few hundred feet. The two grey craft quickly went straight up and dissapeared. The white craft followed us slightly southbound as we drove off then sped off. I took several pictures with my camera which has special black and white film that I&#39;ll need to take to special lab to process, not a one hour service. There were several car salesmen in the lot of the dealership I had pulled up in front of. The car salesmen also saw what had occured. They saw me taking photographs and then realized that the object were not balloons. All the balloons at the dealerships in that area were red, white, and blue with only one using green and red balloons. No grey balloons. Deninately no baloons that large nor Diamond shaped. There was no sound nor lights with the craft. None of the vehicles passing had diffulties nor did my own car. I had no special sensations nor were there any strange smells. The wind did not stop or start with their presence. I felt no bad ! feelings nor felt any fear. There were aircraft in the area but not close, none were in pursuit. I will send copies of what photographs I have taken once the film is developed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

We were out there for about 3 minutes when we saw a teardroped shape object in the air, slowly descending towards the ground. It stopped roughly 100 feet above the ground. It had a bright green haze around the objects bottom and a orange haze around the top. We watched it for what seemed like five minutes when there was a bright, white flash emitted from the object then it dissapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood there amazed for about 30 seconds and we heard numerous dogs beginning to bark and howl. When we went inside the clock read 2:56AM. It felt like we were only outside for 10 minutes at the most. How did time shoot forward half an hour?<n>

I was driving over a bridge and in the distance I saw something with a green and red light. I noticed it and told my friend I thought it was the balloon that transmits Radio Marti to Cuba. (Many people may not know-the US government has a large balloon loacted at Cudjoe Key, FL that transmits Radio Marti to Cuba). I have seen the balloon in the daytime and assumed that&#39;s what I was seeing last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right away I noticed we were still far away from Cudjoe Key. At first I thought maybe they put another balloon up. Anyway, as we got closer to whatever it was, I noticed the lights were very noticeable. I saw a red light and a green light. I was concentrating on seeing if it was a balloon, so I was looking mostly below the lights. I noticed it was not attached to anything and there was no tower below the lights. It was also too low to be a plane. My friend was looking out the passenger window and said he saw a white light and a red light. He did not see the green light that I originally saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got closer to the lights, they moved from my side of the truck because the road hadn&#39;t curved but I couldn&#39;t see them anymore. My friend said whatever it was moved, and he saw it more over the road. He saw a red and white light 100 to 250 feet hovering directly over the highway. He also saw a black mass between the lights in what looked like a triangle but didn&#39;t totally point at the top. From his account the white light was on the top and he saw a red light on the corner of one of the bottom of the points. There was never any sound it made. We opened the windows of the truck when we were close to it, and it was just quiet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept driving looking for a place to turn around because there was a car right behind me. I had to go about 1000 feet before I saw a driveway to turn around. When we went back, there was nothing there. No lights, and we looked to see if there was anything in the air it could have been, and again nothing. It was as if it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had not had anything to drink last night or anything like that. We shared a pack of cheese crackers but I don&#39;t think that would give us any hallucinations. I can&#39;t explain what I saw but I have many questions that I didn&#39;t have before. My friend thought it was a ship of some kind right after seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It had 1 row of white lights at the top and 1 row of white lights on the bottom.In the center were 2 rows of red lights. It was silently flying lower than a tall tree. The object was so strange that I asked my husband to take a look. He saw the object turn left then right and go north toward Lake Michigan. As it turned, he saw 3 lights at the front (yellow, green, and brown). It rose to around 300 feet and flew out of his sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

She suddenly pointed out two brightly lit points of light in the sky, heading in a S-SW direction.  She asked if they were birds, and when I saw them, my immediate reaction was &#34;Hell No!&#34; The two seperate lights caught up to each other, in a leap frog fashion, each crossing and catching up to the first. Both were evenly lit from below, and in the area we were in, could not have been lit from below. I listened as well, given the low cloud cover, and could not hear any sign of aircraft noise. I have extensive experience in video, as well as audio and have filmed both cars at high speed and planes. I have seen and videotaped everything from A-10&#39;s to F-14 and F-16 aircraft, as well as Stealth aircraft at near and far range. With the cloud cover, the noise should have been obvious as the sound would have been reflected by the clouds. There was no perceivble sound. Both points of light disappeared into a cloud bank and we saw nothing more after that.  I immediately started running through things in my head to make sure I had time and distance and direction. My girlfriend was freaked out that I was so freaked by the situation.  I also have experience in visually tracking satellites and other space based objects, and nothing I have experience with could explain what I saw. As mentioned, the two objects converged on each other and diverged at a fairly high rate of speed, and remained consistently lit. I have never seen conventional aircraft perform in the manner of these unidentified objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went out again tonight, and were able to easily identify any aircraft in the air, including a helicopter returning to Ft Lewis.  Nothing looked or behaved like the objects seen the night before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However it appeared moving at a fairly rapid speed at a low angle along the horizon (the horizon in this case was a mountain ridge behind my home), the size of the object must have been substantial, it was 3/4 mile away or more, was a very bright white and easily visible. About half way through the observation where was a pendant shaped irredescent (light red to blue) expulsion from the object (like a trail or gas explosion) which only lasted a moment, while the object continued on as it had originally appeared then disappeared behind the ridge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was flying in a straight line at a low angle to the horizon.  My initial thought was space junk or a fireball (bolide) but the size of it (or it may have been highly heated and just looked big?)didn&#39;t seem consistent.  If it was that big there would have been an explosion or hit someplace??  Anyway the strangest thing I have ever seen in the sky. I have a masters degree in the physical/earth sciences.  I have talked to a relative in the Air Force who launches satellites about space junk as a possibility--he says it wasn&#39;t junk.

In the area where she said it fell there were helicopters and small aircraft circling the area, and a large cloud of smoke rising from the ground.  We went in search of this area but couldn&#39;t find it as when we got off the highway buildings, trees, and growing dusk obscured any view of the smoke we would have had.  Interesting note, there has been no mention of any sort of crash, explosion, or any other catastrophe that would explain the smoke and air vehicles in the area<n>

While i was checking out the last one&#39;s ascention there was another burst through the sky this time travelling from the south east and vanishing towards the north. there was quite abit of light at this point, which made it rather wierd.by about 7:30 am the last one slowly faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We followed it and it stoped high in the sky above the water. We went on the beach and were staring at it. One minute their was 1 light then it change to 2 and then to 3 lights.  It was flying up and down and sometimes it was going left and then changing direction to the right. Sometimes their was a flash of lights and I was seeing a cigars shaped form lighted by its own lights in the darkness of the sky. At times we were seeing a row of lights like windows. At first we tought we were going crazy but we observed it for an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two weeks later I saw the same thing at a different location but I was alone. Honestly I thought I was going insane and i was looking at that bright big light changing from yellow to blue to white to red and hovering above.After an hour and a half I said to myself that it was just Mars or Venus or a star and went to the take out to get something to eat.  When I came back 15 minutes later it was gone and I realized it was not a star or a planet.  It was surely not a plane as it was staying at the same place for minutes then moving up or down or left and right. The only thing I could think about was an helicopter but why would their be an helicopter staying at the same place for an hour and a half and changing color all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw the same thing at the exact same location last year for 2 hours and at the times I tought I was just going crazy but its been 3 times and one time I had somebody with me seeing it with eyes bulging out. He told me to not tell anyone as poeple would think we were crazy but i dont really care what people think and I&#39;m not scared of aliens or whatnot.  Their has been a couple of UFO sighting in this region in the last few year and its even benn in the paper and on the radio. By the report Im reading here it would seem thet ufo&#39;s really exist or we&#39;re all going insane at the same time.  If i see it again I&#39;ll let you know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I saw an object with flashing green and red lights and white strobe lights hovering and then circling over the intersection of Columbia Pike and Route 7. I retrieved my 10 X 50 binoculars from the trunk of my car and tried to discern what the shape of the object was. All I could see was a string of red and green flashing lights and 3-4 white strobe lights. This object gradually moved to the SW and I saw a number of flashing &#34;fireflies&#34; that were green in color detach from the object and fly in various directions. After the object disappeared to the SW I saw several lights from some light aircraft flying in the vicinity of where the object had been hovering. The object emittted a sound like a radial aircraft engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw and heard a similar object flying in circles over my home immediately after September 11, 2001.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

My son, his friend, and I went hunting that evening on a large farm in Burke County. We went into the woods around 3:00 that afternoon and had agreed to hunt until dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after 6:00 that night, I walked to pick up the boys at the locations they were hunting. We then began walking back to my vehicle parked out in the center of an 800-acre field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we walked, we were amazed at how clear the sky was. The stars were brilliant on this cold crisp night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I always hunt with quality binoculars. My son was using Leica’s and I had a pair of Swarovski’s. We used them walking back to gaze at the stars. In this remote large field, it was dark. Light was absent from any streetlights, homes, or traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were getting closer the vehicle, I noticed what at first appeared to be a comet arching towards us from the horizon. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed, but had no trail behind it. We watched this brilliant shape travel from the horizon to directly over us. The speed that it traversed the sky was “comet-like”. The speed that it stopped directly over us was immediate. It stopped on a dime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of us took turns with the binoculars looking at this stationary glimmering energy shape. It glimmered evenly and remained perfectly still in the exact position where it stopped. We watched it for about a minute, trying to understand what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched with binoculars, the object accelerated from zero to comet like speed at 90 degrees from the original flight direction. It was so fast; I had to lower the binoculars to keep up with the object with my eyes as it traversed the horizon and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two teenage boys and I witnessed something. We only reported this to friends and family.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then I noticed that it was triangle shape and bigger than any normal jet liner that I have ever seen, bigger than a C-5.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing it did was a 180&#34; barrel roll really quick with the smoke trails off the &#34;wing tips&#34; following them like you would see an airplane in a air show do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the smoke comeing off the thing changed to a light rusty brown for the last 1/5th of the total length of the smoke trail it was leaving (about 2000&#39; to 3000&#39; in lenght). Then it just disappeared, quit, was gone just leaving the smoke trail to drift slowly to the East East South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say that it disapeared at about 5000&#39; to 6000&#39; ASL over the City of Cypress CA. The angle of the view of the elevation at my location was about 11 O&#39; clock high and the angle South off Del Amo Blvd. was about 5&#39;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The &#34;wing tips&#34; and nose of the thing were bright blue/white and the body was shiny bright like it was coverd with the light from an arc welder&#39;s arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A Lakewood Sheriff also witnessed this after he pulled into the lane next to me after makeing a left turn from Civic Center Dr.onto Del Amo Blvd. East bound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He was still looking at the smoke trail as I glanced around before jogging right onto the service road for my tract. That&#39;s when I got a good look at the two color smoke trail because by the time I pulled into my driveway about a min and a half later the smoke trail was despersing and was all one color now (smokey light blue).<n> <n><n> <n><n> All I can say is that this thing was hauling ass and I was waiting for a sonic boom but heard nothing as it was a nice clear morning and the marine layer had just burned off and I had my window rolled down and the sliding back window of my pick up open.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mr. Davenport and the NUFORC webmaster, you people are doing a bang up job.

I&#39;d just like to share my version in a hope it helps shed some light. On the night it happened I was outside our temporary accommodation at a site we were sharing with the Russian army. I was sitting at a table on a patio area we had knocked up watching a DVD on a portable player.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night was very clear and warm. Most of the other lads were either at the gym or the bar. Shortly before the event I was joined by a mate (I don&#39;t remember who unfortunately) who sat down to watch the DVD.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point I leaned back on my chair and stretched my arms out behind me facing straight up at the sky. When I did so the first thing I remember seeing was a big patch of &#34;starless&#34; sky. This freaked me out straight away but within the next second it became apparent that the patch was triangular in shape because it was moving. This made me realise that it was not the stars that were missing but something massive, black and silent moving in front of them as at the front of the point of the triangle the stars were disappearing while at the back they were re-appearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hard to judge whether the object was small and close or large and far away because of the lack of sound. My initial reaction and with hindsight I would say that it was a massive object simply because of the amount of stars it was blanking out as it moved across the sky and also the speed which it travelled. If it was a small object it was moving FAR too slowly to stay airborne surely. If I had to estimate, i would say that this thing was at least 500 meters and most likely a kilometer wide at an altitude of around 5-8000 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed silently over the mountain horizon I turned to my mate who was also looking up and asked &#34;did you see that?&#34; he replied &#34;yes, what was it?&#34;. He had followed my gaze at the sky and witnessed the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I casually asked my commanding officer if there were any stealth aircraft being flown in the area and he said he didn&#39;t think so. I&#39;d seen stealth bombers and fighters before and I know it definitely was not one of those I saw. It had no navigation lights for one thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have only just got round to looking into this and just recently googled &#34;black triangle ufo&#34; and was amazed at the amount of reports I found. Although it would be awesome to know it was of alien origin, it seems to me (from what I have read) that it could well be a very secret military transport<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was not moving at all.  We tried to catch it by taking some back roads south, but as we got close, it moved away.  We went back to the highway and continued to Manchester.  The object stayed to our south the whole time, but sometimes was even with us, went ahead and even in back of us.  When we got to Epping area, a small flashing red light appeared to the right and another in front of us.  They would appear and reappear randomly.  At one point, the flashing reds changed their flash pattern and the bright white light to the south dimmed to almost nothing, changed to an orange color, changed to a flashing red itself, disappeared and then reappeared as bright as before,  We lost track of the flashing reds, but the bright white continued to dim and rebright and looked to be positioned over Massabesic Lake in Manchester, where we have seen ufos hover before.  We gave up the chase at this point, wishing we had a vidcam or binoculars with us. All three looked like they could have been stars, but they moved. The 3 observers are my mother-in-law ((name deleted)), my wife ((name deleted)) and myself.  ((deleted)) and ((name deleted)) have witnessed ufos before and have actually been directly under one in the past.  I didn&#39;t have an opinion on the subject until I met ((wife&#39;s name deleted)) and after we chased a ufo and then got chased by it, I was convinced.<n>

We were driving south on Interstate 5 when the entire sky lit up with a flash of light that I thought was blue, and my step-daughter thought was green. I was starting to use the phone but was so startled by the light I put it down immediately. The flash only lasted about a half of a second. About thirty seconds later, the sky lit up again with a flash the same duration and the same color. We could see nothing in the sky between the flashes or after the last one.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Additionally, this was a day of heavy chemtrail activity at my parent&#39;s home.  I counted at least 12 distinct chemtrails.  The object was beneath the chemtrails and was highlighted as the chemtrails passed overhead.  The object was stationary for some time but eventually disappeared.

My family and I (wife, daughter age 5, son age 2 almost 3) were on our way home from lunch and shopping. We had turned off of I985 onto Spout Springs Road (heading east) and I guess we were around 1.5 to 2 miles from the Interstate when my wife said &#34;what is that?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared to be several hundred feet up and my first thought was that it was a child&#39;s balloon--one of those reflective foil-like ones but the sun&#39;s reflection from the object was so bright and the objects surface appeared to be so smooth (like finely polished silver) that I got real curious. Also, though it was hard to tell, my wife and I both got the impression that the object was 4 to 6 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We passed the object by and turned around and came back. We actually turned into a side street to get closer and parked. From this vantage point we could clearly see it (not trying to drive and look). The object was moving slowing away from us (like the wind was blowing it though there was no wind at ground level) and it was moving on its axis. This is hard to explain...it would flip and roll sort of like it was tumbling but not consistently in any given direction. From this movement we could make out that the object was an almost flat disc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it would roll to its thin side it looked black and there was no reflection.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it would roll and reveal its flat side it would appear to be silver and the sun&#39;s reflection was strong. It looked like polished silver in the sun. Also, in the middle of the object was a red color--a circle--my wife said it looked like a big silver button in the sky with a red dot in the middle. This middle dot area did not reflect the sun like the rest of the area around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I might ad that when looking at the flat side of the object, I mentioned before how it was smooth and silver...but it also looked solid. I mean it did not look like something filled with helium. I understand that in this we could have been mistaken but to us it honestly looked &#39;hard&#39;. That along with the way it was moving on its axis (tumbling) made the object &#39;not fit&#39;--what I am trying to say is that it is unexplainable to my wife and I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed it for several minutes as it was moving westward away from us (I am assuming it was West because it was heading back towards the Interstate). I decided to try and drive to another subdivision off of Spout Springs road to see if we could get under it. My wife was looking at it as we were driving away, she turned away and when she turned back, it was gone. &#34;It&#39;s gone&#34; she said. I looked all over the sky and it was just gone. This was the most baffling part to us. Our eyes were off of it only for a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another odd thing...When we first saw the object, it appeared to be moving to the north-east. When we were at the place we stopped to watch, it was clearly moving more westward (which from the pace we had stopped was directly away from us).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, I asked my 5 year old daughter what she thought it was, she said that it was a CD (Compact Disc).  As far as she is concerned that is exactly what it was (a 4 foot wide, floating Compact Disc).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as witnesses, there was light traffic moving along the road. Also, right across the street from the area we parked was two men walking up and down the side of the road looking looking as if they were looking for something on the road side that had fallen out of their vehicle. Neither of these people seemed to be looking at the object as their attention seemed to be on finding something in the ditch. There may have been trees in the way that obstructed the view for these guys.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area that this happened in is filled with thousands of homes from closely packed subdivisions. Someone else had to have seen it. There is just too many people living in this area for us to have been the only ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To conclude...I do not buy the aliens from another world bit. However, I can&#39;t account for the object we saw. It appeared to literally defy the law of gravity. If this was a hoax or some strange toy some kid got for Christmas, the joke is really on us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for their report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Home - Phone/Fax 1 250 845 2189 HBCC UFO Forum Board http://216.147.50.102/HBCC-UFO/index.php<n>

No lights on it just a grey looking object. It moved from a north headed to south east direction. The transformer sound did get loud enough to cover your ears. You could hear what sounded like pleaty of electricty passing threw it. I would guess the speed to be about 5 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The lights were slowly circling around, one outer circle and two inner circles, and were slowly moving towards north (the same direction as we were going). There was a sound similar to a fog signal, given at short intervals (there is no fog signal equipment nearhood).

I glanced into the night sky and noticed an orange object near the Planet Jupiter.  It appeared to be the same size as the planet Mars except the orange color was very sharp.  At first I thought it was Mars, but quickly realized it was much to far East.  As I watched the object, it began moving slowly north.  I asked my wife for our binoculars (7x35).  When she returned, I steadied myself on our van to get as good a look as possible. Through the binoculars the object still seemed planet (Mars) sized and a very bright orange.  The brightness faded once or twice for just a brief moment.  The speed varied, sometimes stopping.  It travelled due north and faded from view at the night sky&#39;s zenith.  My observation lasted about ten minutes (0:10 to 0:20).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I dont remmember if it was during the fire works or after, but like, about 0:05, I pointed to the sky, i pointed to something like an aeroplane, which was what we thought it was, i showed it to my cousins and my uncle. we looked at it... it disapeared in the fumes of the fire works... its was very far away- we could only see lights. after some mins or secs, it appears again, but going in the opposite direction- like going back from where it came from. It stoped in the air... then it went a bit down and continued to the direction and dissapeared in the fumes. some secs after it appeared again and this time, i stared at it, and i could see the triangle form, kind of an arrow, like this = ( &gt; ) there were green lights on the back points and a wite one on the front (i cant remmember the light colours very well). then it dissapeared and apeared again in the &#34;2nd&#34; direction again. and dissapeared for good! it was awsome! i loved to see it closer<n>

A few close friends had gathered. At the stroke of midnight we went back to light a Roman candle and some firecrackers. My yard faces north. On the hillside across from me a firework lit the sky drawing my attention up. I noticed a glowing red light, high in the sky. A first I thought it was a red flare, far away. Similar in intesity, pulsating, flickering. However, to my astonishment, It remained stationary. After several minutes I commented to my friends who looked at it with disbelief. We observed it for a few more minutes, when they exclaimed it must be a plane, or a flare that caught an updraft. Hoever to my eye it appeared far away, almost star like, however it pulsed and flickered much greater that any star I have seen. I watched for a while and grabbed my video camera. It was extremely difficult to view, except in night vision mode on my camera. It appeared to gain elevation slowly and to drift slightly to the east. after another 15min+ it flickered brightly and just dissapeared. 2 guests at my party commented they had seen the same thing a few years back, 3 of them (red lights) together in fact, even closer and to the south. I myself had seen something similar, 10 years ago over mission bay, with a yellow however I will have to make another report, I I just discovered this site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have read up on the reports here, and I am dying for somekind of expaination. It seems to be a common phenomena in the San Diego region, and in fact an almost identical report came from a few years back in Spring Valley, even in the sam direction. Is it possible for a flare to do this?...It is hard for me to believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like everyone else, I guess I just want an answer<n>

It was a clear winter night, and while gazing upward we spotted what at first we thought was a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a little brighter than the surrounding stars, and was moving at about the same speed as a satellite at first. We then noticed another, and another. Total there were at least three and possibly as many as six.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about 15-30 minutes we watched as these lights came together in a group, lined up beside each other, branched from one another and then came together again. (I’ve forgotten the exact sequence in which this happened.) At one point three of the lights aligned in triangle formation, and moved around as a group. They took turns branching off from the triangle and then coming back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They all moved in straight lines, there didn’t seem to be much, if any, curve to their movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the disappeared, it was fast, and almost like they were being sucked back into the black of the sky. It reminded us of “warp speed” from Star Trek.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three of us all saw the same thing, and being the open minded people we are, didn’t take long to come to the conclusion that whatever we saw were some sort of space crafts, possessing technology way beyond human capability.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The sky was clear and crisp and it was a beautiful morning. I was walking my dogs in our local community centre and as they were playing about on the grass I was looking at the sky and thinking it was a beuatiful morning when a passenger plane flew over head. It was quite low as all the aircraft seem to be since 9/11 and it reared off to the right and then to the left and a few very short seconds later this object followed as if it had been behind the plane, but it reared off to the right and stopped for a very brief second and followed that path. The object moved across the sky in an elegant fashion and without sound and for a very brief second I noticed white vapour coming from the back. The object appeared to have no shape, it looked the shape of a star and it was a silvery gold colour. I watched the object till it was out of sight and it seemed to glide actoss the sky as if it had a purpose. It was the most awesome sight I have ever seen and I&#39;ve never forgotten it and I remember the detail because I wrote every detail of the experience in my journal. Whether the craft was alien or military I do not know, but whatever it was it wasn&#39;t any convential craft I&#39;ve seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
