Upon going outside,(wife,oldest son &amp; father in-law, we witnessed an object about 30 feet in diameter directly above the our mobile home. A neighbor also saw the object. the light would go off for about 15 secs. and then come back on for about 30 secs. There was no sound  and not even the slightest breeze. 6 or 7 other people in our neighborhood related that they had observed it above our home. Our 2 dogs were very frightened and hid under the house.   This sequence lasted about 5 min.<n>
11/29/78 03:00|Mt. Rainier National Park|WA|Unknown|6 Hours|FIRST TIME REPORTED Late November, 1978 Mt Rainier National Park & Ashford. Double Sighting, 6 Hours|8/7/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/057/S57715.html|2|ndxe197811| FIRST TIME REPORTED Late November, 1978 Mt Rainier National Park &amp; Ashford.<n> <n><n> Double Sighting, 6 Hours<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the last three decades, I have debated within myself, as to whether or not I should report the following incident: I experienced the following beginning late November 1978, Mt. Rainier National Park,  Longmire Wilderness Center, Snow Camping with two other individuals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at Longmire within Mt. Rainier National Park, in the late afternoon.  Their was substantial snow fall which blocked our access to continueing up the Mountain via Hwy 706..  We set up our tent rather quickly due to the snow becoming a snow and rain mix.  We decided that due to the change in weather we would hit the hay early.  Approximately at 2:00 am I awoke with a Migraine which was unbearable.  I awoke the two other individuals and we decided that we would head back home.  Upon packing our backpacks and gear we saw a extremely bright object which we perceived to be a falling star or maybe a meteorite entering the atmosphere and speeding across the horizon.  The object dissappeared and we all thought how lucky we were to see such a lovely event, not realizing what was to come.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We proceeded out of the park via Hwy 706, it was raining lightly and their was snow and ice on the roadway which subsided upon reaching the Nisqually Entrance.  We proceeded at moderate speed toward Ashford, Washington.  As we arrived within the small town we immediately saw a bluish white light of great brilliance directly above a telephone pole which lite up the entire roadway. I yelled at the driver to stop which we did immediately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was in the shape of two diamonds stuck together at one point about the size of a two seater sports car. Within the vehicle we all were talking fast and loudly, what is it, what should we do, where is the camera, why should we take a picture, UFO pictures are never good enough to confirm an actual sighting, should we get out of the car etc.  We were nervous to the point of laughing and screaming.  I remember getting the old fashion,  immediately developing camera out of the glove compartment and then turning to the driver and saying I am getting out of the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon exiting the vehicle I was transfixed on the objects brilliant blue light and the noticable lack of sound and or wind which I was expecting.  My last memory was hearing the other two individuals yell and scream for me to come back as I walked  toward the brilliant object above the telephone pole..I also remember  another vehicle, a station wagon coming from behind the telephone pole on what I think was a side road and stopping also.  The next thing I remember is being back in the car with the two other individuals screaming drive, drive and being extremely frightened and visably shaking. The station wagon I remember seeing was no long there, and the driver proceeded to drive as fast as the roads would allow, with our top speed being over 80 MPH, the object was directly overhead being brilliantly illuminated.  It never waivered from keeping up with our vehicle, turn for turn, stop for stop.  Upon reaching the Eatonville Valley the sky became huge and open, we continued down into the valley and watched the object fly directly out into the middle of the sky, stop and then proceed directly upward at a high velocity and dissappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and the other two individuals proceeded home to Tacoma, Washington and spent the next decade argueing about the amount of time that went by versus what it normally takes to reach Tacoma. To make a long story short there were three hours not accounted for and a picture in the glove compartment not of the mysterious object but of our vehicle empty with all the doors, hood and rear opened, with our  gear stacked around the vehicle.  None of us took the picture.  The irony, it was me who said why take a picture of a UFO they never come out to prove an actual sighting let alone an actual meeting.  The other two individuals involved always agree that something happened but currently one refuses to discuss it and the other prefers not to discuss it. They both become nervous and upset whenever I bring it up.   Myself, I want to dicuss it,  The reason, because of what has happened since the incident.<n>

Let me state that I know this man personally and I can vouch for him that what he saw that night was an experience he will always remember. I really do think this story should be noted online because there where witnesses and just maybe they might see the story and come forward. I really hope you all reconsider your evaluation of this report and post it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here is the story again:  I have a step father who is almost 70 years old. He has a UFO story that I think needs to be told just incase someone else out there might have been a witness can come forward with more info. He tells this story over and over without any discrepancies in his story. At times he gets excided when he tells it because he relives the experience. He has forgotten the exact time the encounter happened and to the best of his knowledge he thinks it was about Nov. 1978 but is possible could be a few years off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He happened to be working in a cotton gin in a town called Arvana, Texas just NE of Lamesa, Texas.  He remembers being out one evening in the field driving a truck when off to the horizon coming to him drifting over the trees was a spinning disk object with lights around. He got really spooked and took off fast across the field bouncing around until he got to the cotton gin. He jump out of the truck with the truck still rolling and went in and told his boss and others and they all came out and saw the spinning craft drift to the side of the gin across Hwy 87. People where really spooked at this site and some went back inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also people in their cars on the hwy stopped and people got out of their cars and where looking at this low spinning disk. It was about 500 Ft high with spinning lights all around...yellow, red, and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it slowly began to pull up and then a bright beam of light shot down from the center as it moved up. My step father then said the cotton gin&#39;s power and the machinery inside then just died off and shut down. Then the craft pulled up higher and the white beam of light turned off and then it shot upward like a bullet till it was out of sight. The power at the cotton gin then came back on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He tells me of another story that happened around Odessa and Andrews, Texas. He had heard of a farmer who would see this craft on a regular bases follow the power lines toward the mountains from west Texas toward the New Mexico but his memory of the story and the details are almost gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He had heard one farmer saw this craft and reported it and the police came out. They did not believe this farmer. He said even some military folks where there but they really doubted the farmers story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then a rancher driving to his ranch stopped by to see what all the commotion was about. After they told him he said oh yea...he would see the the craft ride above the power lines toward the mountains ( in New Mexico??) all the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I talked to some other people I personally know and they also claim to have seen a spinning craft follow low and close behind them one evening as they where between Sweetwater and Abilene, Texas on Interstate 20 back in the 80&#39;s so maybe there is or was a craft  that hung around west Texas in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

11/27/78 20:00|Ukiah|CA|Sphere|10 minutes|UFO over Ukiah, sphere with beams coming out from it...then I forgot the entire sighting until I saw a report in the paper|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33997.html|5|ndxe197811| UFO over Ukiah, sphere with beams coming out from it...then I forgot the entire sighting until I saw a report in the paper<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home after dark listening to the radio. It was either the night of Nov. 18, 1978 or Nov. 27, 1978...the 18th was the day of the Jim Jones People&#39;s Temple killings and the 27th the day of the Mayor Moscone/Harvey Milk killings in SF. I had been listing to news of Jim Jones on the radio all week, then of the Moscone/Milk murders, so I am a little mixed up as to which night it was, but am pretty sure it was the 27th, because it was the 2nd huge event in a week. (The sighting was reported in the Ukiah Daily Journal on the front page the next day, after being reported by others). I was driving south on Hwy. 101 just south of town...1/2 mile, after dark listening to the radio. Then I noticed that the top of my windshield was lit up a little. I looked up and there was a cloud which seemed to glow. I pulled over to get a better look at it and noticed a hitchhiker up the road from me about 300&#39;. He was looking up too. I got out of the car and this huge cloud looked as if the moon was behind it, but the moon was behind the mountains to the south east and hadn&#39;t risen over them yet. As I watched, a sphere began to show inside the cloud. There was no sound at all. Then beams of light came out from it like a Star of David over Bethlehem. At first it seemed more like a religious experience. I felt this overwhelming feeling of awe. Then I looked into my car at my camera on the seat thinking that I should take pictures. But, amazingly i didn&#39;t. I have no idea why i didn&#39;t and after I thought to get the camera, I have no recollection of thinking about the camera again. The cloud seemed to clear and I could see this ball of light. Then the beams went back inside the sphere and the clouds went around it again and it moved west and back around the mountains. I was so amazed and jumped in the car to go home. I was thinking, &#34;Wait till I tell ((name deleted)) (my sister) about this. I also thought I would pick up the hitch hiker and ask him about what he saw. I don&#39;t remember driving past him or seeing him, or don&#39;t remember anything about the 5 minute drive home until I pulled up to my mailbox. I went into the house with NO memory of the saucer!!! I never called my sister about it. I didn&#39;t think of it or remember anything about it. I just turned on TV and that was that!  But, the next day when I got the paper, here was the story. Other people had seen the same thing. Then, when I saw that story I though, &#34;What? I saw something too, why didn&#39;t I remember that?&#34; I was dumbfounded! It took about an hour for me to get the details to come back to me. At first I just knew I saw the cloud with some shape and it took the hour for it all to come back. Then I couldn&#39;t believe I had forgot it and didn&#39;t pick up the hitchhikier, didn&#39;t take a photo and didn&#39;t call my sister and didn&#39;t even remember this...one of th emost amazing experiences of my life! So, they must have done something to block my memory. I have no idea if I lost any time either. I also saw a UFO when I was a little boy north of Buffalo in Niagara County, at night. Then my sister and neighbor saw it again over the woods the next day. But, the article may still be on file on microfilm at the Ukiah library or at the daily journal. I have seen photos of the same thing from Mexico City and Montreal.<n>

I had my camera on my car seat and thought to take a photo but for some reason didn&#39;t.  Then it slowly drifted to the west and went behind some hills but the sky was glowing about the hills.  I drove home and by the time I got there I had forgotten all about it!  The next day the Ukiah Daily Journal had a front page report of dozens of people reporting it.  Then I remembered but couldn&#39;t get the details.  It took days for it all to come back. I have also seen the same UFO in photos over Montreal and Mexico City.<n>

We stopped at a pull off a mile from my fathers house, we usually stopped there.  It was 7:30pm when we got there and we were there a half hour. We noticed these different color lights blinking and it covered a large area.  After 15 minutes we got freaked and thecar wouldn&#39;t start.  My ex ((name deleted)) mentioned walking to my fathers house a mile up road, but I told him I wasn&#39;t staying there alone, and flag a car down.  after 15 mins more we flaged someone down, and they saw it too.  They gave us a ride home and when we went a mile up road it should have been about 8:00pm. It was 10:30pm and we wondered where the time went.  It seemed like a half hour and three hours went by.  We looked out the window where we saw the ufo, and a big found form appeared up in the sky right where we were and a big flash and it was gone.  I always wondered about the missing time, and I do believe we were abducted.  I had another encounter as a kid and other strange occurances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We drove a camper and parked it in front of the old ranch house where I bunked with my father. My mother and two younger brothers slept in the RV. The rustic and less comfortable house, built by German settlers near the end of the 19th c., was situated near a windmill, a sheep shed, water tanks and cattle troughs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night my father and I turn out the lights to go to bed.  We were settled in the house, miles from any highway or road, and approachable only by way of a narrow limestone trail cut through sharp grass, oak brush, and scrub.  It was a clear, cool night with no storm activity. We unrolled sleeping bags over the beds.  My father’s rifle rested in a corner.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had turned out the lights around 10 pm.  My father noticed something after I had closed my eyes and asked me what I saw through the front windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A dim blue light entered through a north window, and increased its brightness until the room was cast in a luminous blue.  The light continued through the window a few moments before abruptly shifting positions to a west window.  The room remained saturated in bright blue. Neither of us moved. The light then vanished suddenly after less than a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We couldn’t sleep after the light left us, and we talked about what we had seen for half an hour or so before finally falling asleep.  Next morning we resumed the conversation about the lights.

I could have hit it with a sling shot  Two spotlights on front slightly outboard of center, two &#34;clearance lights&#34; on outside, flat bottom.

11/17/78 15:00|Interstate 80/25|WY|Other|10 hrs|I saw "heavenly apparitions" (for lack of a better expression) that lasted for approximately 10 hrs.|2/14/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48770.html|10|ndxe197811| I saw &#34;heavenly apparitions&#34; (for lack of a better expression) that lasted for approximately 10 hrs. At the time, I was nineteen years old. It was a clear cool day on 17 or 18 November, 1978 and I was hitchhiking east from Jackson WY to Denver CO on Interstate 80. Outside of Rock Springs WY, I got a ride with a twenty-something year old professional driver who was ferrying a U-Haul truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He asked me, &#34;Where ya&#39; goin&#39;?&#34; I answered, &#34;To Denver&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He replied, &#34;Sit back, we&#39;re headed all the way...that is if you don&#39;t mind going about 50 mph. That&#39;s all this truck&#39;ll do.&#34; That of course was fine with me. The ride was mostly uneventful. It was a cool sunny day and there seemed to be almost no wind. Sometime mid-afternoon I noticed a point of light blinking due east at about 30 degrees, but I didn&#39;t really give it much thought and put it out of my mind. I figured it was sunlight reflecting off of an aircraft or something. As we headed towards Cheyenne WY it was becoming dark. The light I had noticed hours before had become strangely luminescent compared to the clear moonlit night sky. Things started to get strange when we turned south to go to Denver. The light turned as we turned and remained in front of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The U-Haul driver became alarmed and pulled over to the side of the road and stopped. &#34;What the heck is that? I said, &#34;I don&#39;t know. I think I saw it blinking in front of us hours ago.&#34; He replied, &#34;Yeah, I saw it too.&#34; Then he continued, &#34;Here let me see.&#34; At this he blinked his headlights on and off as if he was trying to signal whatever it was we were looking at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it appeared to get much closer (about the size of a quarter at arms reach). It seemed to have a cylindrical body with a cone on top, but I couldn&#39;t be sure as this was darkened by five luminous points on its perimeter. Each shot out what seemed to be rods of white light. I remember rolling down my window and I could faintly hear a high-pitched whirring sound. This all happened very fast and frightened the driver. He stepped on the gas. As we sped away, it seemed that we went under the apparition.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Excitedly he yelled, &#34;Is that thing followin&#39; us?&#34; At first I said, &#34;No.&#34; Then I rolled the window down all the way, leaned out of it and looked back as far as I could. I came back in, &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s following us.&#34; At this time, I could see out of the corner of my eye it shoot back into the eastern sky and hover from where it had begun before we turned south. We watched it several minutes and just couldn&#39;t believe what we were witnessing. As we talked about it, I glanced to my right at the moonlit mountain landscape. I noticed three or four hazy translucent purple spheres in the distance. I couldn&#39;t tell how far, but they were about the size of a nickel at arms reach. They seemed to be floating slowly, effortlessly, almost bouncing. It seemed as though I could almost see the landscape through them. They each had a smaller amber light that seemed to rotate, somewhat quickly and irregularly, around them. We watched these for sometime also. Again, I glanced to the east and noticed two star-sized points of light moving from north to south. I also noticed another point of light of similar size, further south, that was stationary. For some reason I remember telling myself that when the two moving points of light were in line with the third stationary point of light they would all move together. Surely, just a moment later when they all came on line, they all proceeded &#39;together&#39; and disappeared slowly into the southern horizon. As we entered the Denver city limits we left the purple spheres with their amber companions behind. Only, the original luminous point of light in the eastern sky remained.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver took me to a part of downtown with which I was familiar. So I wouldn&#39;t inconvenience him I asked to be dropped off. I walked about a mile to my brother&#39;s apartment and knocked on the door. When the door opened I looked up over my right shoulder and could still see the luminous entity/object flickering its shafts of light. It was about 1:00 A.M. so I went in and prepared to retire. I didn&#39;t mention anything to my brother or his roommates until the next morning. I can&#39;t say whether or not I experienced &#34;missing time&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I have been reluctant to refer to what I saw as UFO&#39;s or extra-terrestrial. I have maintained a cynical view of contemporary scientific academia which too often relegates itself to dogma. I have complete conviction that our science at its highest is completely incapable of defining the infinite and infinitesimal dimensions of time and space much less defining whether or not margarine causes heart disease. I continue to keep my faith in Christ and I have come to believe that our best understanding of what I saw can be found only in metaphor. Simply, &#34;what was outside is inside&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have had no such experiences since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of alleged event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

There wasn&#39;t many cars to thumb and I was admiring the crystal clear night sky . A few commercial jets went by at what was maybe 30,000 ft. At an altitude where the light&#39;s from the planes were clear but not able to make out an airplane shape. A light approached from the NE Which was to the left and in front of me. There was no foliage on the trees and I&#39;m estimating it was Nov. This particular light looked very normal in the night sky until it changed course towards me. It was very large and at the same altitude as the passing commercial jets. It had colored lights surging in a circular pattern on what I assume was the perimeter of the craft. It was at least twice the size of the jetliners.It came to a complete stop at about 80 degrees off vertical and at that point I decided to get off the roadway and to the base of a tree as I was a little bit chicken.It stayed in one spot for a good 5 min. I placed my head against the trunk of the tree and kept an eye on the craft to see if it was sitting still or my mind was playing tricks with me. With my head steadied I compared it to an overhead branch and it was still. It eventually moved off towards the southwest and the lights were  shut off . I remained under the tree untill the next car came along which also picked me up . I got in somewhat panicked and asked if they had seen anything . They said no and I left it at that.I told people about now and then and was struck by how many people went on to tell me of there UFO sightings. I&#39;m certain of what I saw. I grew up on Air bases and am very familiar with most aircraft and even blimps . It was a UFO by definition and chilled me to the bone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

11/11/78 18:00|St. Albert (Canada)|AB|Unknown|10-20 minutes|In response to sighting of 08/15/78 in St. Albert|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45619.html|13|ndxe197811| In response to sighting of 08/15/78 in St. Albert<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe I saw the same object in the about the same time, give or take a year.  But, being an estimate of time, and the grade and age I think I was, I think it&#39;s the same PLACE.  My experience took place in an area of St.Albert where the field is huge and borders with schools. Coming home in the evening from outside skating at one of the schools, my sister and I crossed the street and entered the field through &#34;the hole in the fence&#34;.  As we walked about 15 ft, just by the ball diamonds, we noticed an extremly huge &#34;spot&#34; light crossing back and forth through the field, as if searching for something.  There was no sound, and nothing to see but the light.  We froze in one spot, and watched this light as it virtually &#34;searched&#34; the field from one side to the other.  As it approached us, being frightened, I believe now we were in shock, my sister pushed me down, and told me to lay still and quite as she covered me in snow.  She then covered herself next to me.  She was so quick to act. I think she had covered both of us in less than 30 seconds.  Just as she finised herself, the light passed our heads by inches.  As the brightness of the light passed, we peeked to see that it was once again on the other side of the field.  We jumped up and watched as the light disappeared straight up.  For a second the sky was dark, then a bright streak of white and red shot south through the sky.  I have NEVER seen anything move and dissapear so fast in my life!We ran back to the &#34;hole in the fence&#34;, crossed the street, to where the street lights were, and took the &#34;long way home&#34; along the houses and street lights.  We were frost bit, and I don&#39;t have any memory of entering our home.  I have tried to speak to my sister about this incident many times through the years, but only lately, has she spoken about what happened in the field.  I don&#39;t even remember entering our crescent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

11/10/78 22:00|Strasbourg (France)||Light|10-15 minutes|Jumping Light-Point in the Sky|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73440.html|15|ndxe197811| Jumping Light-Point in the Sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I like to report an incident, which occurred 30 years ago, somewhere in October/November 1978.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Together with a friend, we were traveling by car in the east part of France heading to Strasbourg. It was already night , might be 10PM or 11PM, 50-60 miles south of Strasbourg on a motorway and still we had to drive 1hour to our destination.  We have been tiered already , so we decided to stop on a park place for to take a little rest and to eat a snack.  It was a starlit night and while resting , we looked to the starry-sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a while, we recognized that out of the star-scene in the west of the starry-sky a bright lighting star dissolved out from the star-alliance and started to move.  That light point ( approx. 30º above the horizon ), moved, even jumped very rapidly up and down, left and right, zigzag and perpendicular. e tried somehow to estimate/scale the magnitude of those movements by stretching or arm forward for to see how many fingers the movement ranged.  So far I remember, the movement from the light-point covered approx. the width of 2-3 fingers on a stretched arm, crossed in less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the beginning from that &#34;light-show&#34; in the sky, we thought that an airplane or helicopter might be responsible for this , but we rejected this idea because:  1st  the movement started from a fixed-position and 2nd the profile of movements was so incredible, rapidly in speed and rapidly in changing of move-directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From our location we could not estimate how far away from us that light-point was , as according our first impression , that light-point appeared just as a bright star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not hear any noise, either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light-point movements went on for some time and after a while we decided not to look further to that light-show in the sky and not to bother ourselves with things we cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Somehow deep impressed and confused we left the scene and continued to drive towards to Strasbourg. We promised ourselves not tell anyone about that event , because we thought that nobody will believe us and we feared of ridicule.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, 30 years past, but the memory on that night is for me still present  as it was yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting that case now, because internet does provide now the opportunity to share  those experiences with an open-minded community.  Maybe someone has a simple explanation for that .<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

In the distant sky, in front of me, I saw a series of blinking white lights.  They looked to be slightly bigger than the size of a star.  There was one light that moved in varying patterns in the sky.  It moved in a way that no other aircraft of ours has the capability to do.  I was mesmerized.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned onto Interstate 89 and headed south about a mile or so.  I was watching behind me as I saw the light staying in the sky.  Then in a split second the light was right next to me in the northbound lane.  It did this two more times – staying behind a mile or two and then there it was, next to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned off the interstate and turned left up a road and then into the family driveway.  When I got out of the car the triangle shape UFO was there.  It was totally silent moving slowly down toward the ground.  There was a red light in the center of the bottom of the ship that glowed outward.  My family came to the door and screamed to come in.  The ship went up and away without making any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three weeks later, the ship returned to the other side of our driveway and descended lower than the first time.  Because it was lower the triangle shape was clearer and it still had the red light in the center of the bottom of the triangle.  A relative was with me and pushed me toward the door of the house to get away from it.  The ship took off, again without a sound.  That was the last time I saw this type of ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

It made a soft hissing sound  which is what made me look up.  I could see some purple lights on the underside (only 2 or 3 but my view was obstructed by trees on the sides of the road).  It was a very dark night so I had a hard time discerning size and height but I estimated it was about 50-60 feet up and 80 feet across or more.  It was moving at only 5-10 mph.  The purple lights were a dark color and not terribly bright.  I saw no other color lights on the object (ie, no normal white/red/green aircraft lighting).  (It was not a hot-air balloon, I know what they sound like, plus I would have seen it glowing in the darkness).  I didn&#39;t feel anything (breeze, warmth, static, etc) from the object. I ran up to the intersection and crossed the street to try to see it after it passed over the trees, but I was unable to see it. I was in college at the time and had not been drinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were on a straight country road and the object kept pace with  us.When we turned north the ufo turned north also.As we pulled into my sisters driveway we were facing east again and the ufo was over her backyard. We walked to the back clutching each other in an arm lock and standing in awe we observed it hanging motionless in the sky.It seemed to be putting on a show just for us because it split in two parts and then three forming a large triangle in the sky overhead.Each time it split it became as brilliant as the first object.There was no noise detected . All the objects started to rotate in the sky keeping the triange shape. We kept asking each other &#34;Did you see that?&#34; Finally the objects moved slowly off to the south and disappeared. We had a house full of peo! ple inside and we were so much in shock that we didnt go to the window and tell them to come out and see. My sister had a better encounter but that is her story.<n>

As we were returning home, we were passing through this small town when I looked at the driver and he was staring straight ahead.  When I asked him if he was okay, he just looked at me with a terrifying gaze and said...do you see those lights?  I was in the front passenger seat and hadn&#39;t noticed them because of the color of the lights in his vehicle reflecting off the inside of the glass anyway.  To our left (south) through the trees we could see a grouping of lights (about 20) moving along with us at the same speed we were traveling, about 30 feet off the ground.  There is a mountain ridge also to our south, and the lights were below the ridgeline, between us and the ridge, and appeared to be about 300-500 yards away.  The lights were all blue and randomly scattered about the object.  The color could best be described as a cold electric blue.  They didn&#39;t flash or rotate.  We stopped the vehicle about a mile down the road and the object also stopped.  It span of the lights were about 100 feet and were about 20-30 feet high.  We could see the lights very well through the trees.  It just stayed there as we got out (and got a soda).  There was no sound.  When we left a couple of minutes later...it continued to &#34;follow&#34; us until we went through a cut in the hill.  When we came out the other side (the valley opens wider), the object burst out from behind the hill into the open and immediately flew over the south ridge.  We never saw it again.  We knew &#34;what&#34; we had seen and it still gives me chillbumps to think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
