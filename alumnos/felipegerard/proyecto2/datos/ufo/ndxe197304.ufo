At the entrance to the trail was and still is today a security light, as I got close something told me to look up as I did I saw a triangle shape object about 12 feet or so moving very slowly North above the tree tops and making no sound what so ever. This object had two white lights on either side and appeared to be black in color as far as the size I would have to say it was huge, as I was amazed to see something that big and moving as slow as it was. I watch it for about a second or so and ran back to get my cousin. When we both got back outside we were looking at the back in, it have several very bright white light in the back maybe five or six and was still moving very slowly toward the north. We watch it for about 5 min or so until it was out of sight. We contact the local Air Force Base to enquire about what we had seen, but did not get any answers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Af|5/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12846.html|2|ndxe197304| Have always felt certain it was a meteorite, It was a burning ball of fire about 3 to 4 foot in diameter. This object hit the earth. After hearing Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast 5-9-00 I am not so sure it was meteorite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself, my brother and two other teens at the time were hanging out in my parents front yard. I was looking accross the flat land east of my parents home when low on the horizon i saw what at first glace was children shooting a Roman Candle. Within less than a second a realized the ball of fire was too large to be a Roman Candle firework. (plus i thought it was strange that the children at my neighbors would be shooting fireworks at this time of the year. The ball of fire was low on the horizon and moving from east to west. It was not moving at a large rate of speed. It looked sort of how a jumbo jet seems to float when it passes close over head. The object continued to move from east to west and flew almost directly overhead. It looked to be aproximately 300 feet over us. It was a ball of fire approximately 3 to 4 feet in diameter. It passed so close we could easily hear the sizzling of the fire. The object was yellowish orange in color. Just prior to passing overhead the object broke into two pieces. The larger continuing along the same trajectory, but the smaller one still traveling horizontally began a sharp decent. The smaller object appeared to have fallen appx. an eighth of a mile west of my parents house. My friends and i scouted the area on bicycles knowing the object would have to be smoking or burning. We found no sign of the object. We were certain it hit the Earth. The next day on the school bus to school we were telling the story, when we noticed a group of kids began to crowd around the back of the bus. I went to see what could be more interesting than my story. Two friends of mine were out in a boat ( the Mermentau River runs just behind my parents house) running fish or crab lines, when the ball of fire fell from the sky hitting so close to thier boat that it actually splashed water on them. The object is still on the bottom of the Mermentau River, All witnesses are still alive. And with the right metal detectors could most likely still be recovered.<n>

Family and friends shared experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 12 yrs. old. We lived in some apartments in Oakcliff Texas. My brother, myself along with some other friends were out playing. I looked up at the sky, just above the tree line hovering above our apartments was a cirle like object with windows all around it. It made no noise as it spun slowly. It never lit up. I went and got my parents. My dad didnt believe me but my mom came out and saw it along with many other people. I ran and knocked on doors to ask for a camera only to have the doors shut in my face. By the time I got back it had left. Nobody remembers it taking off.But my brother and my mother still remember this event. I had the feeling they wanted water. We had a huge creek that rad behind my apartments, they were spinning just feet from the creek.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
4/15/73 21:30|Cold Lake (Canada)|AB|Light|3hrs|Strange lights|5/15/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49989.html|4|ndxe197304| Strange Lights Indeed  Upon returning home on a beautiful spring evening, in the approximate year of 1973, rounding the corner to my country abode I saw 3 lights above the forest. It was evident that these lights were round in shape. The time was approximately 9:30pm - it was dark by now. The colour emanating from them was like bright headlights, white with a slight yellow hue, yet they were above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a mother of 6 children and of sound mind and character. I don’t make stuff up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live near a very large, deep and pristine lake in NE Alberta, Canada.  My home is nestled in a forested area adjacent to one of the many bays of this lake, named Cold Lake. To the west of my home, approximately 4 miles, is the largest jet fighter Air Force Base in Canada. I am very used to and familiar with seeing and hearing these jet aircraft on a regular basis. What I witnessed this night was very different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of gazing upon this anomaly, one of the lights sped away in a westward direction. Its take-off or acceleration was like nothing I had ever seen in a conventional aircraft, jet, helicopter, prop-plane, whatever.  One could compare its take-off to the release of an arrow from a bow.  Also, there was absolutely no sound. I would estimate their distance away from me at ½ mile or less. This left 2 lights still in place above the trees. Given the estimate of ½ mile distance away, the actual size of the lights would likely be somewhat larger than virtual headlights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No structure, definition or appendage to the lights was visibly evident; it was a dark night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon my arrival home, one block from my initial visual, my son, very excited, asked if I had noticed the lights above the trees over there? I responded with, &#34;“yes&#34;, of course! We discussed the matter briefly, including the one that got away and decided to investigate further.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were hovering over a marshy area. The water was lit up due to the proximity of these lights emitting upon it. The light would pulsate seemingly on a timed or regular basis. It is important to note that there are no roads where these lights appeared; the only road is the one to my house. I state this so that no one will have notions that they were motor vehicles; how could they be?  At the time of this sighting we had 5 dogs. Don’t ask why, we just did. As the light decreased from full intensity to zero light or pulsated from normal to no light, the dog’s hair would stand straight up on their backs and they would bark, acting erratic in nature. When the light returned to normal the dog’s behaviour did too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said that my son and I were going to investigate further and so we did.  At approximately 10:00pm we decided to drive around to the top of a nearby knoll hoping to get a better view.  The lights were still visible but somehow appeared to have moved to a more distant location.  We watched them (the 2 remaining lights) for about 10 minutes and then decided to go home.  Upon attempting to start the car it was discovered that it was unable to turn over; it was &#34;dead,&#34; so-to-speak - very uncharacteristic of this vehicle because the battery was new and maintained regularly.  We supposed that somehow these lights had an effect on the operation of our car.  So, we had to walk home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the evening progressed we would periodically look outside to see if the lights were still present.  It was midnight when we finally went to bed and the lights continued in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must say that the whole experience gave me what I would define as a spooky or unnerving sense of emotion. We returned to our car the next morning; it started without incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely enough, I spoke to a neighbour about this event.  Earlier in the evening, at about 7pm, he was travelling to his home and witnessed a light or lights travel immediately over his car at a high rate of speed.  Perhaps these lights were related or of the same group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was traveling in the family station wagon with my mother and 12 year old sister. We were headed home from shopping traveling south on south ave in the small town of Glenolden pa. as we approached the area of the Macdade Mall we could see the traffic was stopped up a head. Then we noticed that people were out of their cars looking up at the sky.As we looked up there was a giant craft of some kind, I mean this thing was huge as big as the mall and the parking lot all put together. There were a few white lights on the center of the under side and the craft made no sound at all. It just seemed to hoover there in the sky.The craft was an oval shape brownist gray in color. there many witnesses to this event. We watched it for about five minutes then continued home. After arriving we called our local radio station to report what we had saw, they were receiving many reports of the same object in the sky.That night it was all over the local news. And by the next day it seemed, it was completley forgotten about and never mentioned again, there was no explanation ever given for what we saw in the sky that night. to this day my sister and wonder what it was that we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

To my right a silvery ,cigar shaped object floated a few feet above the ground matching my speed and following the curve of the road.  Suddenly, the object began to move away and up into the sky at about a 40 degree angle at an incredibly fast speed.  It disappeared in a second, maybe two.

4/5/73 21:30|Houston|TX|Disk|30 seconds|Perfect disk with lights on edge; one side red, one side green: no sound No clouds, disk blocked out stars, moving S.to N.|6/18/98|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03611.html|8|ndxe197304| Perfect disk with lights on edge; one side red, one side green: no sound No clouds, disk blocked out stars, moving S.to N.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened in, or around, April of 1973.  I remember that it was close to my birthday.  The weather was mild and cloudless.  I think it was a Saturday night because my parents were out.  I was almost 12, a well read and responsible kid, with no more than a passing interest in the unknown. For some reason, I went out to my front yard (the house was in the 2500 block of Southgate Blvd, Houston,TX,77025)and looked straight up.  At that moment a large disk (red lights on one side, green lights on the other, not shiny, totally silent)passed directly overhead, blotting out the stars as it passed.  It moved in a straight line over my house towards the north and I watched it until it was out of sight:  total only about 30 seconds.  As it moved away it appeared to be completely flat, and not very thick: a true disk, like a discus or a coin.  Oddly, I wasn&#39;t alarmed.  I didn&#39;t tell my parents or anyone at school.  And I pretty much forgot about it until around 1981. I know this was not the Goodyear blimp; I had seen the blimp at night in our part of the city before.  The shape was wrong, and the blimp was far from silent at that altitude. The disk was well above tree height, in that neighborhood of tall pine trees.  My closest guess on the size and altitude would be 100&#39; across and 1000&#39; off the ground. I am hoping that others may have seen this.<n>

We do not understand why the National Security Agency would be interested in a UFO sighting, since it would have been an agency interested in domestic events that would have pursued the event, we believe.  PD)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Family encounters with glowing objects, spanning 50 yrs., for three members.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I preface by saying events filled the lives of my family, in the early 1970&#39;s, leading to my being contacted by NSA. One evening, I heard a flying device in my living room, which decended, after the wall became physically transparent to it. It &#34;appeared&#34; to me, a basketball-sized sphere. It flew off at a 45* angle, retreating up and away. I could hear it whooshing, all the while. My bus. partner was in the next room. I began having dreams of floating up, from my yard, into a craft. I will never tell what transpired, in the dream, as I entered the craft, in order to prevent copy-cat stories. I heard from my sister, she knew of what I spoke. So, I am not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My business partner and I began having esp, and I dreamt future events. I told him of my dreams. One night, we were driving in the piney woods area of east TX. After midnight, and all alone, a hugh, very large object, glowing red, appeared as we crested a hill. It was up ahead, on the right, over a field. It flew down, as if landing, across our road, but instead, circled us. It repeated the manuever. Something was &#34;talking&#34; in my head. I said, &#34;They want me to turn left, just up there!&#34; No road was visible, and my partner questioned how I knew. I said, they are telling me, it is right up there. Sure enough. And my partner said, &#34;You have never been here, before. How did you know!&#34; So, I turned onto the small road, and came to a stop, and said, &#34;They are telling me that if I am not prepared for this, I am free to leave. They offer me that choice.&#34; He said, &#34;Go! Let&#39;s see them!&#34; I began to shake, being only 18 yr. old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said &#34;No. I&#39;m not ready for this!!!&#34; I turned around, away from the craft, which was on the ground, up ahead, in a field. I drove off. My partner was very upset with me. I was young, and too naive. If only, I had more maturity. I have since regretted that choice, beyond words. Two others in my family had similar experiences. One had an object &#34;beam&#34; him, with a light that &#34;grew, forward&#34;. They had lost time, and a car that had all the wires charred, leaving them stranded. My sister got cancer of her chest. Their watches never worked again. The word got out, and when I was in the Navy, two years later, I was taken to D.C., and questioned by NSA, while I was in the back of a car. I told them our experiences. There were two men. Even after I left the military, one of them came to my home, and asked me to move, to a city near my sister, 400 miles away. I declined. I believe now, they wanted to conduct research, of some sort. Years passed, life was not easy, because of health. Then, on May 14, 1998, five objects literally materialized. I was &#34;prompted&#34; to go outside, I carried my cat, with me. I looked up, and they were stoboscopic, decending at a soft angle, and then the strobe stopped. They glowed blue-white. They were maybe 150 ft.,up. They assumed a chevron, with one extra object(ship?), on the right. They then turned, in formation, pointing to where we first encountered, years before. Then they flew there, at a fast speed, and disappeared, over the horizon. I  &#34;felt&#34; they said, &#34;Not to forget you.&#34; I should have returned to our first meeting place, but did not, because that was not overtly sensed. Perhaps I was not receptive, and maybe they had, indeed, returned. I&#39;ll never know. I have lived a difficult life, and just wanted someone to know. BTW, my wife used to be awakened by my crying out in my sleep, about &#34;them touching me&#34;. My marriage was short lived. She did not accept the existance of life elsewhere. What she, or others reject, is irrelevant to what I know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for allowing me to at least write about this.<n>
