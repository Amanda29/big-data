7/16/61 19:50|Arlington Heights|IL|Disk|25 minutes|Saucer shaped object hovering near flight path of O'Hare Airport at about same level as airplanes going in for a landing|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/033/S33957.html|1|ndxe196107| Saucer shaped object hovering near flight path of O&#39;Hare Airport at about same level as airplanes going in for a landing<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a UFO story that is unbelievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 1963 and my husband and I were walking home from a trip to the neighborhood drug store.  Half way home and at a corner, something made me look up into the sky.  Right overhead and no higher than the planes coming into O&#39;Hare airport was a flying saucer, hovering in place.  It was aluminum colored, had a huge white light in the bottom of the vehicle and around the middle a band of portholes.  There was a light behind the portholes and they seemed to be rotating very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched in awe and even waved at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon a one engine plane appeared and approached it.  It had no problem avoiding it.  Up, down, sideways, it never let the plane get too close to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The plane finally left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we thought it was leaving only to realize it was going out towards one of the passenger planes coming in for a landing.  The pilot saw it and for one moment veered off its path to look at it and then right back to its landing pattern.  The UFO then returned to where we were and hovered over us until it starting getting dark.  It then headed for downtown Chicago.  We could see its light for a long time before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO made no noise at any time. There were lots of people watching but no one had a camera and we were too far from home to get ours.  Besides I wasn&#39;t about to leave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We reported it and I am sure many others did too, because the morning paper printed a small article about it saying it was an advertisement pulled by a small plane.  Sure it was, right in the midst of the flight pattern being used at the time by O&#39;Hare for all its flights.  My husband, a skeptic and a mechanical engineer would only comment that it was not like anything he had seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will never forget it and have been a complete believer in UFO&#39;s ever since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

7/15/61 23:30|Newberg|OR|Egg|2.5 hours|Bright orbs flying in sky west of Portland, Oregon|6/2/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98259.html|2|ndxe196107| Bright orbs flying in sky west of Portland, Oregon<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw orbs in the sky north of Newberg, Oregon, above Chehalem Mt. in the summer in the early 60’s.  I am unsure of the exact year that it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was lying in bed looking north out of my bedroom window watching the stars when suddenly, one changed position quickly.  Over the next several minutes, several of the objects changed position moving next to others quickly.  I kept thinking they were some kind of aircraft and the angle I was at was probably giving me an illusion, and what I was seeing wasn’t really what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued watching for several minutes, (20 to 30 minutes,) seeing the orbs continually changing position in relation to each other at irregular time intervals.  Then one flew into the group of about 12+/- from the west at a speed I had never seen before or since, (I have watched the shuttle and space station go over since this.)  Seeing this I watched closely knowing what I was seeing was not an illusion.  Then, some flew away at incredible speed or just disappeared like lights that turned off.   Within a short time they were all gone.  Then after another 20 or 30 minutes they began to reappear and some began flying back to the group, again flying fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another 20 or 30 minutes went by and again they disappeared or rapidly flew off.  Again after a few minutes they reappeared or flew into the group.  I watched them and fell asleep after another hour or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning a report came on the radio saying several people reported the sighting.  The report also stated the Air National Guard had tried to intercept them twice and had them on radar.  When they approached they disappeared, they went back to base and turned around to go back and again they lost them, so they went back to base and landed because they couldn’t intercept.<n>
7/15/61 23:00|Mount Hope|WV|Unknown|20 to 30 minutes|Object only visible as a streak of light at very high altitude traveled from horizon to horizon in a few seconds for a total of 6 times|7/16/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29405.html|3|ndxe196107| Object only visible as a streak of light at very high altitude traveled from horizon to horizon in a few seconds for a total of 6 times<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 1961, when I was 15 years old myself along with two of my friends had just laid down to go to sleep on the lawn of Mount Hope Junior High School very late in the evening, possibly around midnight.  We had told our parents we were camping out in the woods, but had just spent the evening running around town and having fun, planning to return to our houses around dawn.  We were laying on the north side of the lawn that faced City Hall.  Myself and one of the other boys had almost gone to sleep, but the other one was just laying there watching the stars.  After a few minutes he excitedly yelled, &#34;did you see that&#34; along with some other phrases that I don&#39;t remember, but he was very excited. We were a little agitated because we were almost asleep and this guy was known for his pranks, but to humor him we watched for a few minutes and didn&#39;t see anything so we tried to go back to sleep.  What he had seen was a streak of light that had gone across the sky at a very high altitude and lasted only for several seconds but had traveled from horizon to horizon in that brief time.  After about 15 or 20 minutes he yelled that he had seen the same thing again, so this time myself and the other friend decided to wait it out to see if he was pulling our leg.  Sure enough, after 20 minutes or so we all three saw a little steak of light go across the sky at a tremendous speed.  I think if we had blinked we would have missed it.  We watched this happen at least 6 times, including the 2 times observed by the first friend.  Each time it happened the streak of light was a few degrees farther north until on the last sighting it was barely visible toward the city of Oak Hill, West Virginia. We even theorized that maybe the object was going all the way around the Earth and we were seeing the same object instead of 6 individual ones.  The boy who had first seen the light stayed awake practically all night, but myself and the other friend eventually went to sleep.  This incident has always been on m! y mind and stirred my intrest in UFOs, especially when sightings are reported in this area of southern West Virginia.  As usually is the case, this is a story that we just kept to ourselves because we didn&#39;t want to be ridiculed.  But what we saw was real and I&#39;ve always wanted to tell this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in July 1961 is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/15/61 11:00|Gettysburg|PA|Cigar|5 hours|Rte 30 West, near Belmont Rd. intersection  7/15/61 4 hours Gray metallic cigar craft on Herr property in field below hill|4/9/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35989.html|4|ndxe196107| Rte 30 West, near Belmont Rd. intersection  7/15/61 4 hours Gray metallic cigar craft on Herr property in field below hill<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a light blonde Dutch-cut little girl of 4 yrs old, the daughter of a college prof. My mother was watching my younger brothers 3 and 2 in the house. We lived Route 30 West about 6 miles outside of Gettysburg, near Belmont Rd. Often I was let out of the house to play in this foot-high weedy grass field and I played alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see the house but I was 25&#39; away from the house. I remember sitting in the grass then something picked me up by my arm and dragged me thru the grass. This being was in a solid shiny material and I believe it was charcoal grey. This being had no feelings for my being dragged over the ground. It flew across the ground. I saw a cigar shaped metallic grey craft positioned on the ground below the hill. The field has a slope and this meant the craft would not be seen from Belmont or Rte 30 West. I was terrified. A being in a buff colored tight outfit came up from the center of the craft, as up a ladder, to meet us. I was hauled inside where they put me on a table. I remember struggling to get away and being so afraid. Painful probes were put inside my nose and mouth. Weeks later I had pain in my lower abdomen and would experience pain every time I breathed. I remember thinking that they were communicating without talking which I now know is telepathically.  They had no feelings, ice-cold machinelike qualities which terrified me. I didn&#39;t remember ears or hair like we have and I think with hypnosis I might be able to recall more about them. I couldn&#39;t sleep well for weeks. In Sunday school I remembered that angels flew and I thought I was being hurt by angels. I couldn&#39;t tell my parents because I had not the language to describe this and I was terrified to relive this experience.  Also, I played an angel in my grandmother&#39;s church for a Christmas play and decided that I could never burst my parents&#39; belief about angels being bad.  I remember thinking that I was going to die as they worked on me with metal and tubes and painful implements. At one point I think I went into shock. When I came to, at one point, I was levitated in the air about 5&#39; off a table. There were these beings sitting around the table looking up at me.  I think they were examining my genitals and reproductive organs. During the time I entered the craft I could not speak. It was if I was paralyzed. Later I remember thinking that time had stopped and I wondered how they could have done that. I believe that the craft was moving at some point and I was placed against a wall in an upright position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t remember much else but when I was able to go home from the field my legs and arms were badly bruised.  I had missed lunch but my mother thought that I was not hungry as I often came home on my own. I&#39;m not sure if she thought I may have gone up to the neighbor&#39;s house (they let us play in their field) and got food there which sometimes I did. I believe that I was gone more than was revealed by earth time.My father came home and saw me.  He was very upset and accused my mother of abusing me.  I was taken to a physician the next day for an exam. The local practitioner believed that I was showing the sudden bruising signs of leukemia.  I kept assuring my dad and mom that nothing was wrong and that mom hadn&#39;t hurt me.  I never told them about the &#34;angels.&#34;  To this day only my husband and children know about my abduction.  Exploratory surgery was performed on me soon after and bone marrow was taken from both my right thigh and my left kneecap.  The findings were negative.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was in my 20&#39;s an unpaid psychic approached me in FL where I was living at the time. She explained that I had indeed been abducted by aliens and that I am still being monitored by them.  Probably with a device inside me?<n>
7/15/61 06:30|Falconbridge (Canada)|ON|Cylinder|?|Sighting of silver object on crash course, lost time,8 yrs. old, no concept of UFO's, no trauma, I am puzzled.|5/13/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28744.html|5|ndxe196107| Sighting of silver object on crash course, lost time,8 yrs. old, no concept of UFO&#39;s, no trauma, I am puzzled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 8 years old at the time and used to go out at around 6:00 am to play by myself, then return to my house in time for breakfast.  This was sometime in July or August 1961. It was during the summer vacation.  It was about 6:30 when I chanced to look up. I saw a large bright silver, cylinder or oval shaped craft I immediately took for a jet or passenger plane.  I thought it might be from the Skead (Falconbridge Airforce base). I was used to seeing planes from there, but only during the Air Show. The base is just south of Falconbridge, the  nickel mining town I lived in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft made no noise but it was on west to east and certainly a crash trajectory. I dropped everything and went to see where it crashed. It was headed into a horseshoe shaped hole in the ground about three hundred meters long and 200 meters wide. The east side of the pothole (this is what we called it) rose to about 25-30 meters high and the walls declined to about ground level with the rest of the town, the west end being level.  There was nothing there so I went to the east side up on top of the hill and looked to the east into the mines and saw nothing also.  I then went home totally perplexed and very hungry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I arrived home, my mother asked me where I had been all day and I tried to tell her that I wanted to have breakfast but she said that I had missed breakfast and lunch but made me a sandwich.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suffered no trauma what so ever but I am completely baffled about the situation.  For one, I had heard nothing or knew anything about UFO’s.  I also have a bullet shaped mark on my left shin. When I was about 14 or 15 years old, I showed it to my doctor and he said that it had to be made by a deep puncture. I remember nothing about any puncture, nor do my siblings and parents know about something like that. The doctor said it was large enough to have had to have stitches. I remember no such event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are many other mysteries to this event that have occurred at later dates.  But just the sighting and the lost time are enough.  Please e-mail me or call as this has been inside of me for a long time and I have told no one other than my brother about this. Should I pursue this?  What do I do next?  Who do I talk to? As I said before, this hasn’t traumatized me but I am very curious and confused about this.  Please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The pastor stopped his car and we all piled out to look a the lights.  They were so bright you had a very hard time looking at them.  The craft made no noise and was hovering over us at about 500 feet.  The pastor piled us back in the car and told us to not talk about it.<n>

I could have hit it with a rock. I was circular, with a panel of 4 large lights on the bottom flashing different colors, and a panel of lights around the side flashing red/black. What I remember most was the craft,.... and the utter fear of what I was seeing. We ran through the house to find our parents, but then the craft was gone. The craft was silent, appeared about 50 feet in diamater, and was about 14 feet thick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  One of two sightings by same witness.  PD))<n>
