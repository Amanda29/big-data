I noticed that there was a mysteriously looking circle of clouds around the moon.  If you would look at the moon, the radius of the circle would be about the size of a pinky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its colors were also unusual to see in a dark sky, you could make out colors of red and green, sort of like a fading rainbow.  We also noticed that it changed its diameter a couple of times on a small scale.  Immediately I called my mother who lives in Northeast Philadelphia, and she confirmed seeing the same thing.  To my surprise when I called 3 of my friends in Brooklyn, NY, they said that they saw the mysterious circle as well even though they were about 80 miles away from where we were.  Inside of the circle there was no sign of other clouds at all, but outside of it there were some scattered, but the circle itself was separated from them.  It finally started to fade away around 0200 on Sunday morning, December 1,2001.  My girlfriend&#39;s sister had also noticed this phenomena who was in Northeast Philadelphia at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was also wondering where I can find out if more reports were made regarding this event.  I am aware that reports were made in the past years of mysterious clouds appearing, and some thought it was UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am looking forward to hearing back from you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses were observing a &#34;Moon dog,&#34; caused by ice crystals in the atmosphere.

Rainier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a former USAF pilot and know this was NOT a fixed wing, helicopter, air balloon, or satellite. There was a very high, almost occlusive, layer of clouds this night. From Yelm, I saw a distinct orange dot of light(about the size you would see the planet Mercury on a clear night) hovering due east of my location at about 35 degrees above the horizon. It was generally stationary, but would move 2 to 4 degrees left, right, up or down at least one time in each minute. It&#39;s changes in direction were instant. Twice in the ten minutes I watched it, it made large movements, once dipping slowly down to the horizon, and once moving about twenty degrees north. Then it would return to it&#39;s original location and &#34;hover&#34;. If this was not a UFO, it may have been a cloud layer reflection of a laser someone was aiming at the sky? It ended at almost exaclty 21:00 -- maybe a good indication it was the end of some laser targeting exercise at Fort Lewis. My neighbor and my son saw it too. I&#39;m curious to know who else saw it.<n>

There was a ton of light pollution around.  Target, Safeway, lots of big shopping centers and stores was in the immediate area with huge parking lots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up in the Northern sky.  I was on Colfax Avenue at Quail.  As I looked up, I spotted this ball light which was white around and an undetermined color in between the white.  This blinked and flashed as it must have entered the atmosphere.  However, it did not leave a tail behind!  This looked very very similar to a space craft entering the atmosphere but didn&#39;t see any recordings of occurance of this date and time especially anything heading northward! I was curious if there was another meteor shower going on, but there was no record that I could find of that either.  The reason I ask this, is that there were a couple other objects of same style of craft that must have entered the atmosphere.  Has anyone looked into this?<n>

I was sitting on the couch with my eyes closed and I was not asleep. I heard a humming sound that grew louder and all of the sudden the room was filled with white light. I couldn&#39;t pinpoint the source of the light and the humming seemed to be everywhere, not just coming from one direction. This lasted for about a minute before I was able to get up and look outside. When I did look outside the light was gone. I told my boyfriend about this and he told me a about a time about 20 years ago when his sister lived up in a hollar just above his house. She called him late one night, she was crying and her children were crying also. She told him to come up there because there was a spaceship (her exact word) hovering above her house. This is a very mountainous region of Virginia and I don&#39;t know if anybody else saw anything or not. I&#39;m looking forward to the next update on your page to see if anybody else reported anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personal note to the NUFORC staff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This story was relayed by my mother-in-law and, as you can see, I told the story in the first person to make it more understandable.<n>

We immediately noticed to our North at about 25-30 degrees above the horizon, a stationary red light hovering below the cloud cover. After about 5 minutes of no movement by the object, I called 911 and attempted to report what we saw. The 911 operator told me they had multiple calls about the object and they did not know what it was. I then called my son from inside the house and he also observed the object. During the course of events, the object began to randomly pulse, sometime disappearing completely, then returning. At times, it appeared to be emitting and/or absorbing what looked like white static electric discharges, but that may have been an optical illusion on my part. There were commercial aircraft in the LAX landing pattern farther north of the object, that may have seen it at around 2250. During the 20-minute observation from my POV, the object&#39;s only movement was to &#34;drift&#34; from west to ease by about 4-6 degrees and gain some altitude. The object continued to pulse until it seemed to drift out of sight up into the clouds or departed at about 2254. We called a friend in Garden Grove, located about 6 miles SSW of our location, but they could not see the object. We had no camera to record the event, but there should be multiple reports logged with the L.A. County Sheriff&#39;s 911 dispatch between 2230 and 2254. This is the 4th &#34;red light&#34; event I have seen in my 43 years and I have no idea if this is terrestrial (DOD?) technology or E.T.<n>

But, I think it was about an hour or so after lunch because the remainder of the day on my calendar is leave (I remained at the office, I just could not perform anymore duties because I was a bit shaken).  The weather was overcast and it had been raining a bit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was looking out of my office window (building located downtown ), I saw a flat dark, grayish object appear just above the buildings about 4 blocks N. of my office bldg.  The object was flat, with an odd sort of rectangular shape.  It definitely was not a helicopter.  It flew very close to one particular highrise, a building I usually watch because it frequently has window-washers cleaning the windows, and it is one of just a few buildings in the center of the view from my office building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thougt the object was a plane.  Then I thought I was seeing things, because it did not fly by, but rather just circled the building in question.  It then hovered near the top of the building as if it were trying to survey it.  It did this long enough for me to stare for several seconds, then to get my glasses and stare for several more seconds.  The object the quickly speed off approximately due north.<n>

When we got closer we saw that it was not attached to anything and was hovering, about a hundred yards up.  It was dark so we couldn&#39;t see the shape, but from behind I could see three large orangish colored lights in the shape of a triangle in the back.  By the time we turned around to go back, not more than 20 seconds, it was gone.  It was fairly open in the area so if it was anywhere near where we saw it it would have been visible.<n>

At first, we thought they were airplanes over the AFB, but they were stationary and didn&#39;t have the usual lights one sees on planes at night.  When we looked at them through my daughter&#39;s binoculars, we could see them better.  They were triangular-shaped, but without the bottom of a triangle - they were like upside-down V&#39;s.  There were two larger ones and three smaller ones.  They were just hovering over Robins AFB all night long.  I kept getting up to check to see if they were still there and they were. Around 1:30 am one of the big ones just left - it was there and then it wasn&#39;t &amp; when I got up to look again around 3:30 am, there were only two small ones left. Finally at 6:22 am 11/29/01, there was only one left.  This is not the first time that I have seen strange things over the base, but it was the first time that I ever had a chance to see them with more than my naked eyes.  These things are sometimes long and oval-ish with orange lights on the underside, and I have seen some weird looking round ones, too.  They never show up in the late spring-early summer either.  They always start coming in late November and you can see them 2-3 times a week until as late as the last week of February/first days of March.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from the Air Force base for this date.

I then noticed it was actually moving towards me . It was a dark triangluar shaped object with three lights That I could see . The very bright light in the center of the craft which was approx three fourths of the way up the craft from the rear , and two reddish orange lights which were smaller with one at each corner in the rear .I could not tell if there may have been a similar small light on the front of the craft as the bright central light made it diffucult to tell and its placement being closer to the front than it was to the rear . It was traveling slowly toward the southwest and as it flew overhead at the altitude it was at I would guess that it would have appeared to be about four inches across at the rear and about five inches in length .Roughly the same size or perhaps a little larger than an A10 would appear at a similar altitude . I live roughly 50 miles northwest of Fort Leonard Wood missouri and A10&#39;s frequently fly over our area . As the craft proceeded overhead  I had to walk out from my porch and continue around to keep the craft in sight .I didn&#39;t hear any noise coming from the craft nor could I distinguish any exhaust vents on it either . The lights were not strobing and I asked some of my friends and co workers as well as family if all aircraft had strobing lights or not and they could not tell me either .I myself don&#39;t ever recall seeing aircraft without strobing lights .The sides of the craft were straight and the tips were rounded . I didn&#39;t note any after effects and my eyesight was not affected . The only discomfort noted was only while looking at it because of the intensity of the bright light .As far as backround , I am a 44 year old divorced single parent with three children still living at home .<n>

Assumed at first to be aircraft.  Were temporarily blocked by view by trees.  (We were driving on the interstate.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a bit, two came into view on the horizon.  They looked to be the approximate height of one of those poles that have red warning lights for planes.  The light was a blinding white and was pulsating.  We began to wonder if it was some unusual type of aircraft.  We saw them to our right as we were heading South, but they then became blocked by view when a hill on our right came between us and the two lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving and my good friend was the passenger in the car.  She then fell asleep and i continued to watch the sky for any more signs of the light.  I could begin to see the pulsing glow from at least one of them from behind the hill we were driving along.  I started to get the feeling that it was going to reach the top of the hill and become visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sooner had I thought that than one of the pulsing white lights was right beside our car on the right.  It seemed to not have traveled the distance over the hill to get to beside our car.  It seemed to have just been in one moment still behind the hill and in the next instantaneously beside our car.  I woke my friend up who was on that side of the car.  She immediately saw it as it was essentially right over her window.  She was able to look up at the underside of it.  I was able to lean over and see it through her window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a blinding white light that was incredibly powerful.  It was pulsating regularly.  My friend describes it as an oval shaped object with a flat bottom and curved sides.  Neither of us could see the top.  I could not see any material in the middle of the oval, the matter it was composed of seemed to form an oval shape with the center cut out, similar to a donut.  Both of us sensed, however, that a middle to this craft may have existed, but was not visible to us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The pulsing light was definitely coming from the ! perimete r of the craft.  When it would flash, the whole craft lit up with a glow while it sent out a pulsing flash that could be seen from a great distance.  This particular craft beside our car then was behind us as we traveled down the interstate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the next hour or so we could still see at least two of the lighted objects in the distance if we looked back or looked to our right, depending on which direction we were heading.  The closest way my friend and I can describe the light the craft emitted is to state that it each time it flashed it looked very similar to the photos seen on the news of air bombing.<n>

Object made no sound!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in crestwood KY.  I was driving home last night from diner and driving through pewee valley at around 11:20 pm, I looked up and saw an object ahead and above me with 2 large lights on each side and some blinking lights in the middle.  As I drove on the object seemed to stand still and not move at all or very slowly.  As I continued driving I was apparently heading toward the object because it got larger.  I got to my turn at the crestwood baptist church and turned right and the object was on my left.  As I drove I continued to stare at the object trying to figure out what it was.  It was kinda high in the air but not airplane high.  More like the height of the hot air ballons which is what I thought it was at one point until I got close enough to see there was no ballon.  Then as I drove on a bit more the object began to move from my left to the right toward louisville.  I slowed down and eventually stopped in the road rolled down my window and heard absolutely nothing as I watched it fly ahead of me.  It flew slowly at first and then gradually sped up and maintained a steady speed.  It had 3 white lights that seemed to be on three corners of the object like it was triangle shaped and had some blinking lights in the middle.<n>

11/26/01 22:20|Lenexa|KS|Formation|17 minutes|Light Formation over Kansas City|12/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20586.html|28|ndxe200111| Light Formation over Kansas City<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m hesitant to report this, as I&#39;m not completely convinced the objects we saw weren&#39;t conventional aircraft (helicopters), but am reporting it for confirmation in case someone else does as well. Last night at 10:20 PM I was carrying groceries in from the car when I noticed several bright points of light in the sky overhead that appeared to be moving in a westward direction towards me. As there is a lot of conventional air traffic overhead at night I didn&#39;t pay much attention at first until I noticed that they seemed to be flying in formation; not a V pattern or anything like that (they were all over the sky in no pattern), but in tandem with each other (they maintained roughly the same distance from each other as they crossed the sky). That night was very cold and the wind was blowing from the west. There was also heavy cloud cover that frequently obscured the lights for 15-20 seconds (at times I could not see all of them at the same time, and by the end of the incident cloud cover had thickened to obscure all of the lights). At first I thought they were just stars, as the moving clouds gave the appearance of the movement of stationary objects behind them, and indeed some of them were (as I watched closely I noticed that they didn&#39;t really move). However, even as the clouds moved I could see some lights that seemed to move while others didn&#39;t, and at least three of the seven lights I saw moved across the entire sky from the far horizon to directly above the eaves of my townhouse where they were finally obscured.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw them it looked strange enough that I called into the house for my girlfriend to come out and see them also (approximately 10:23). As we watched I tried to verify that the lights were actually moving by looking at them and a stationary object overhead and visually measuring the distance between them. At first I used the moon, as it was the only stationary object close enough in sight, but later I was able to use the eaves of the house as well. The objects looked like large, very bright stars (single blue-white lights just like stars but they didn&#39;t twinkle or blink; no red or green lights were visable at any time). They slowly moved across the sky, from east to west against the very strong (at least at ground and cloud level) wind, and at times seemed to change speed. As they got closer to directly overhead, the lights stopped and hovered in place for 2-3 minutes before starting to move again in the same direction, then quickly disappeared behind a very thick cloudbank and were obscured completely. As it was very cold with the wind chill and I was in short sleeves and still holding 25 pounds of frozen chickens and bottled water I decided not to wait and see if they were still there when the clouds cleared; the cloud cover was very thick by then and it didn&#39;t look like it was going to break anytime in the next several minutes. My girlfriend and I went through the townhouse and she went out the back door to see if they were visable, but said they weren&#39;t (the clouds were too thick). I went into the kitchen, where the clock said 10:37; earlier I had just come out of the kitchen and was going back to the car when I saw the lights which is how I knew it was 10:20.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned, I am hesitant to report this as nothing happened which would preclude an optical illusion (stars and moving clouds) and some conventional aircraft (helicopters) being responsible for the incident. However, it seemed strange that so many craft (helicopters or otherwise) would be moving so slowly in apparent formation over Kansas City against a very strong wind at that time of night, and that none of them looked like anything more than very bright stars. I have reported one other incident, a non-incident actually in Lawrence where a strange appearing (but conventional) aircraft flew overhead similar to an earlier report from the same area in Lawrence.<n>

(this latter difference in sky color may have not too been noticable to anyone not looking for it) The lit part of the sky was a lighter color than the surrounding sky, with a tinge of blue.  This happened during a heavy snow storm so it could have been lightening, but I&#39;ve never seen bright blue lightening before, and that doesn&#39;t explain why that part of the sky stayed a little bit lit for at least 45 minutes later...the lit sky has returned to normal at last peek (11:15pm)<n>

I&#39;m usually alone on the walk and  frequently notice a satellite, about 20 degrees above the horizon, crossing east to west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both of us saw a spot of light near the path of the satellite I normally see, but insead of moving east to west it was moving in what seemed a straight line from the southeast toward the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed this flight for about 10 seconds and then saw the light make a near u-turn to head back toward the southeast. At this time it&#39;s movement became herky-jerky, seeming almost to stop and then speed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light then altered direction moving almost due east and behind a loud bank. Just before disappearing, I thought the single point of light split becoming two lights heading in the same path. My wife did not see this.  My eyes are better than my wife&#39;s but the two lights were visible only briefly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No sound was associated with the event.<n>

It hovered for a few seconds in the sky and then proceeded rapidly downward and disappeared behind some trees.  It looked like it landed within a mile or two beyond Junipero Serra, but we did not investigate it further.  Also, it seemed like it left a faint trail as it descended downward, but this disappeared.  We were astonished; this bright blue &#34;thing&#34; did not resemble a plane, meteor, or any other object that we have ever seen in the sky before.  I have seen random lights and other things that I couldn&#39;t readily identify before, but nothing that I have ever felt the urge to report on a UFO site.  What made this different was that the entire object was blue and glowing (i.e., it was not like a plane with lights on its wings or tail), and the straight downward path was unlike any other flight path that I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observers:  my companion, female, late 20s, microbiology PhD student at Stanford; myself, female, early 30s, attorney.  No prior UFO reporting or researching in our backgrounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports of the same event from the Bay Area.

This is what we thought it was until we realized that these lights were moving very rapidly behind the clouds in the west and north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights, sometimes alone sometimes multiple, seemed to be chasing each other &#34;playing or dancing&#34;, changing colors from white to red, then yellow, then green and blue.  The colors were not bright, but muted or pastel.  My husband had the impression of children playing tag.  They moved fairly fast from south to north, skimming the edges of the clouds at the edge of the storm front, &#34;peeking&#34; through the clouds in the north, but most of the activity was in the western quadrant.  We live in an isolatd forest area 12 miles from town. These lights continued intermittenly for aprox  6 hours.  Myself, my husband and two house guests also observed the lights.  Three of us are of American Indian decent.  My husband and I also observed a similar light object, orange and yellow and red, in Aug 1996, in the west sky at aprox 8 pm EST.  I am having a hard time describing what  we saw,  because the words don&#39;t fit the vision. If you could imagine a flash light being shown through a prism,  so that as the light moved it also changed color, only on a much larger scale.   There was no definate shape, just and eliptical light source.  Since the sun had already set, I ruled out the possibility of sun rays through the clouds producing a sort of rainbow, but rainbows don&#39;t flitter across the sky from south to north.  My husband&#39;s impression was that the movement was not random, but controled.<n>

About 30 comet-looking balls were dropped from the craft.  i told my sister it looked as if it were deploying something.  each of the &#34;comets&#34; fell at the same velocity but were deployed at irregular intervals.  during the whole event the &#34;ufo&#34; wobbled there as it hung in the sky.  after we stood there in awe of this thing for about ten minutes we freaked out and went home.  we were convinced this was the end of the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> of course it wasn&#39;t the end of the world.  i called 911 and they laughed at me, but both me and my sister saw something neither one of us had ever seen or could comprehend.  we are still convinced we saw a ufo.  as i listened to peter speak on coast to coast am i had to email this in to the website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The sphere didn&#39;t seem too large, we thought maybe it was some sort of weather balloon or small blimp.  It was stationary for maybe 10 seconds then it took off very quickly in a straight line heading south eventually dissappearing  into the horizon over downtown LA.  It moved in the direction the wind was blowing so we didn&#39;t think too much of it at first, though it did seem to move much faster &amp; in a much more of a  straight line than would be possible by mere power of the wind.  Then about 30 seconds later, an identical one appeared &amp; repeated the same pattern.  This continued for several minutes.  All in all, we saw 5-6 of these spheres do the exact same thing &amp; in what seemed like a precise pattern &amp; timing.  It was very curious indeed.  I didn&#39;t think to report it until now.  I just saw an online news blurb about UFO&#39;s in which there was a photo of an incident in Arizona about 5 years ago that looked somewhat similar to what my friend and I saw last year.  I was curious to see if anyone else in the Hollywood area saw the same thing.  We are very &#34;normal&#34;, responsible people and run our own small record label.  We have absolutely no reason (nor spare time) to lie about something liike this.<n>

The lights where blinking and the lines where rotating, so they must have been circles. The distance between the lines was about 1 meter. It was dark allready and trees where behind the object and very soon it disappeared behind the houses. I run two blocks to stand in the same street (victoriastr.)as the object but couldn&#39;t see it anymore. The UFO was at least 4 meters in diameter and moved in searching speed (not too fast)towards the east following the traintrack for what I could see.<n>

They were southwest in location and low in the horizon.  They were very bright and left smokey dark black trails behind them.  They moved very slowly downward over a 20 minute time-period.  We have no idea exactly what they were but they were very bright and so slow that we knew they were not planes so figure they must be meteors or fireballs.  We were so excited and didn&#39;t know who to inform of these strange sightings.  Glad to have found this website!  My husband and I are 40 years old and my daughter is 9 years old.  We looked at the fireballs with binoculars.<n>

I observed the following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bright object the size of a star, moving rather slowly across the sky.  At first I assumed this object to be a satellite as I have seen them before moving at about the same speed.  It was brighter than those I have seen before.  I was thinking perhaps the space station or some other more reflective larger object in outerspace.  This object appeared to be at least 10-20 miles up and probably a lot more and outside of our atmosphere...  Traveling in a straight line from low North to a higher South projectory.  This was in the Western Sky.  Nothing seemed strange about it though, until about a minute later, and keeping my eye on it and driving, it changed Directions.  All of the sudden (and a few holy ****&#39;s) later this object is going directly backwards from its original course.  I know this is not normal.  I am a well informed astronomer and also pretty well versed in physics.  This is Not normal at all and I know nothing of any technology here on earth that could duplicate this fact.  it traveled about the length of 4-6 moons in the opposite direction and while looking for a place to pull over and observe this object was no longer visible. it disappeared but I did not see the disappearance.<n>

I thought at first that they were airplanes, but over the course of about 30 minutes, about 50 or more of these objects appeared in the sky.  They were going in all directions...up, down, side to side.  Some were stationary for a while, and then just shot up into the sky...or to the side...or straight down!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen.

It was so obvious and so clearly seen - I know there must be others who saw it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The best way I can describe the appearance is that each one looked like a fireball.  They were very small, so I assume they were very far away but I don&#39;t know how far.  They were covering the whole horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since this happened right after September 11th, I was terrified that we were under a terrorist attack, but when we called someone to have them flip on the news, they saw nothing of the event on TV.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I got home after that weekend, I looked on the internet, posted to message boards - and found nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am certain that what I saw was NOT some natural light phenomenon, nor was it airplanes - unless there were 50+ experimental aircraft in the sky.

It appeared to have a red ring around it. I compared it to the building lights around me and it was nothing like it, nor do we have buildings that tall here. I compared it to the other stars, and it was huge at least twice the size of them.  I stood very still and noticed that it was moving.

I noticed a bright silver looking object about 3 or 4 km above where i was hovering in the sky moving slowly from side to side, shining and then not shining as it moved side to side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then whilst the first object moved along the same way as described above, two more objects arrived, but at immense speed, stopped near the hovering object, and shot off again in the opposite direction it came from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If a normal boeing is flying at 800km/h, I would guess that these objects must have been moving at a fifty times that speed.  I called for my brother which was inside the house to come and check this out with me just to make sure that I was seeing correctly.  He confirmed, he also saw the same objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole sighting lasted about 5 to 10 minutes, there were 4 objects in total.  The four objects was hovering together for about 10 seconds and of they went together at one hell of a speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw this same sighting on tv about a year or two ago, and that&#39;s when I remembered what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did report it back then on a ufo report centre, but my brother never got to confirm this per e-mail.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s aliens tho, maybe just government experiments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the time of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I discussed it in detail will my father who urged me to report it.  He gave me this web site to do so.  Why did I wait to report it? I had a friend&#39;s husband who is a retired airforce pilot say that many sightings are reported in this particular area where an airforce base is and fly secret aircrafts that may look unusual to a civilian and I took his word for it.  But after looking this web site up, I saw another individual report a sighting on the same night in the same area and knew I had to submit my story....... I live in Jacksonville Beach and was on a trip to Pensacola to a company to give flu vaccines.  I left the beach at approximatley  2am.  I was traveling west on Interstate 10 in my car.  At 0405 I noticed a low flying aircraft flying toward me, traveling east. It was visible through the left of my windshield and left side window. I thought it might be a radar plane at first but soon realized it was shaped like a stealth/chevron. I wouldn&#39;t say it was larger than an average aircraft.   It had 10 large white circular lights on the bottom of the craft slowly going on simutaneously and then going off to where I could not see it.The lights were triangulary placed.  One at the point, then two, then three, then four.   When the lights came on it was very clear. It was shaped like a boomerang with a jagged edge, like the stealth.   There were NO other colored lights (Green/red)as would be expected in normal aircrafts.  To compare it to a full moon size, I would say it was at least one and a half times the size of the moon.  It made no noise, which scared me because I just went to a sea and air show with the Blue Angels here at the Beach a few weeks ago and witnessed many different looking jets and aircraft that were pretty deafening.  It seemed to travel very quickly for a craft flying that low. (Difficult to say how low, a guess...2-3 miles)  I slowed down to watch it go by, but it was gone in about 30! seconds , the lights went out and never saw them turn back on. I knew it wasn&#39;t anything I had ever seen and thought it may be a UFO.  I quickly noted the time, the exit I was closest to, a tractor trailer a quarter mile in front of me was the only other vehicle around, and I noticed him driving erraticaly as if he was trying to see it go by as well.  Im sure he saw it too.  I even wrote down his licence tag number to see if I could contact him later if I needed to, but I misplaced my notepad.  Im still looking for it.  If you&#39;re out there reading this, please write in!!...As requested I will make a sketch of it and mail it in for you to see.....Thanks for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual at length over the telephone, and she was most convincing.

11/20/01 02:55|Panama City Beach|FL|Chevron|5-7 secs|At 02:55 I saw a glowing orange object (approximately chevron shaped) which moved rapidly across the sky from west to east.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20513.html|76|ndxe200111| At 02:55 I saw a glowing orange object (approximately chevron shaped) which moved rapidly across the sky from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a sane, sober 51-year old professional who has always been skeptical of UFO sightings.  However, last night I saw something which I cannot explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was walking my dog at 2:55 a.m. (this is not my custom, but I had fallen asleep on the sofa earlier), I looked up to the sky to see if I might get lucky and see a straggling meteor from the Leonid showers of November 18th.  The night was clear and calm, without a cloud in the sky.  A beautiful, starry autumn night in Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, I noticed a glowing pale orange &#34;shape&#34; rapidly moving across the sky from west to east, very faint so as to be barely discernable.  I couldn&#39;t see an actual body per se (such as an aircraft), just the unbroken shape of orange light which seemed almost translucent, as if I could still see the stars through the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape was somewhat like a boomerang or chevron, except the leading edge was straight across (as opposed to &#34;V&#34; shaped on this front edge).  It was perfectly symmetrical across its width.  I have difficulty determining the true size or speed, because I couldn&#39;t judge the altitude.  However, I observed it across a radius of approximately 100-120 degrees and it covered this distance in approximately 5-7 seconds.  This seemed to be an unbelievable rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no sound at all, moving with absolute silence which defied my mind&#39;s ability to comprehend.  The moon was not visible but if it were, I would judge the width of the object to be about 5 or 6 times a full moon&#39;s diameter.  The length of the object from front to rear was perhaps 1X a full moon&#39;s diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It bothers me that I will probably never know any answers to this event.  I only know what I saw and am 100% convinced that the object was not a natural phenomenon such as a meteor or a cloud.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.  We suspect this was a very interesting sighting, very similar to others that have been reported to NUFORC recently of objects very similar in description.  PD))<n>

They were bronze in color, and elliptical in shape.  Their sides came to a point, rather than just rounded.  All looked to be the same size.  The formation they were flying was similar to a Less Than sign (&lt;).  They were traveling from N.W. to S.E., and being a pilot myself, I would guestemate around 40,000 feet.  The sky was clear.  I watched them from about a 60 degree sky position from my right side, to about a 30 degree sky position on my left side.  They flew virtually overhead.  I saw no other lights, nothing flashing, just the steady bronze color.  I heard no sounds from them, but at that altitude you probably wouldn&#39;t.  There were no trailing streams of light coming from them.  I know the Leonid Meteor shower has been going on, but with meteor showers, the light goes extremely fast, has a trail of light, and is generally really bright.  These lights could not be meteors.  There is not a great amount of military aircraft around here.  The objects I saw were traveling quite fast.  Probably 3 times as fast as an airliner in cruise.  I&#39;m not sure how fast our military aircraft can go, but it was impressive whatever it was.<n>

Triangle shaped craft We have received mail from a young man in Portland, who, while laying outside watching the meteor shower had a very unusual event occur involving a triangular shaped craft which dropped out of the sky to a position directly above him at an estimated distance of 15 to 20 feet. The craft was described as having a &#34;red light like thing all the way around it and a black dome in the middle that turned white.&#34; He says there was no sound coming from the craft at all and, after what appeared to be about 5 minutes, it left as he heard the sound of a car coming in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OUFOR contacted this witness and gathered a few more details from him. These are his words... &#34;During the 5 minutes that I lay there in surprise, I had a strange calmness come over me as well as a tingling feeling. When the black dome became white is when the tingling occurred. It couldn&#39;t have been more than 5 minutes though that&#39;s what it seemed like. I ran into the house afterwards, but I didn&#39;t tell anyone because they would just laugh at me and say I&#39;m full of it. Nobody, including myself, believed in UFO&#39;s until that night. I have had dreams both nights since it has occurred, of the craft, and also I have seen aliens in these dreams, but that is probably my mind seeing pictures of things I&#39;ve seen before and adding them in. The main reason I reported this is because I wanted to know if others saw the same.&#34; This now appears to be the third report of UFO activity in this area, the second of a triangular shaped craft seen during the meteor shower and the third from a sighting that was reported on August 1st which included two videos taken of the same craft on the same day. Analysis of that video have shown that this craft was found to be cruising the same area as this young mans physical address 3 months before his reported encounter which seems to be an abduction situation on the surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eric Byler - Oregon UFO Research.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Eric Byler, of Oregon UFO Review, for submitting this report.

The night was very clear, and I looked up at the night sky to see if there would be any remnants of the previous evening&#39;s Leonid meteor shower. After about 5 minutes (@2:30 am) my eye caught a motion in the northern sky (about 70 degrees), and I saw an object or group of objects traveling directly south. At first I thought it was a group of birds flying very close in a wedge or v-shaped formation, but as I stared, I&#39;m certain that I could see a single solid wedge shape, with what appeared to be large grey bumps (possibly the same color as the object, but as if they were reflecting ambient city light). I estimate there were 5 to 6 bumps on the object. I watched quite closely to see if the object passed between my sight and any stars in the sky, and it appeared to &#34;blank&#34; out a few stars as it passed. In very quick order, I first thought they were birds; when I suspected a single wedge object, what came to mind was a stealth-type bomber (B2 or F-117A). The object appeared to be cruising at approx 500 - 1000 ft, and I suspect the &#34;wingspan&#34; was 100 - 150 feet. I can&#39;t estimate how fast it was traveling. It took a straight course from north to south, and I believe it passed in and out of my vision within less than 10 seconds. As I watched, I crossed further into the yard to clear the trees, and watched as the object simply faded from sight into the night sky, never changing course. I was struck by how completely silent the object was, and the night was very quiet (not unusually quiet; traffic could be heard in the distance, bird was heard afterward). If it weren&#39;t for the extreme quiet and lack of any engine glow or lighting, I would simply suspect it to be a craft from Miramar AFB (and I still think it may be). But I listened very carefully for at least a minute afterward for any type of sound, and heard nothing. I watched for another 10 minutes and scanned the sky for any other activity, saw nothing, and returned into the house. During and af! ter, I w as very calm, but a bit excited by the sight of something I had not seen before, and could not explain.<n>

No sound was heard during or after sighting that could be attributed to sighting. Object moved in a straight direction and was out of sight in about 15 seconds. No &#34;skidding&#34; was noted of the object during length of sighting. There were no lights visible on the object.<n>

Then, after about ten minutes, they split again. One advanced northward, and the other remained in a hover mode, perhaps advancing slightly northward.  I then saw a very small light leave the remaining craft, and it fluttered downward erratically, kind of like a spark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I arrived home, this second craft advanced forward again, and I noticed it was shaped somewhat like a plane, but all the lighting was white and steady.  There were no blinking red and greens that are normally seen on the wing and tail sections of a plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it slowly move northward, it appeared not to have a body or shape.

About the time indicated we were looking due west when appeared a triangular shaped craft perhaps the size of a large commercial jet. It was a triangle with lights all around the edge between 7 and 10 alltogether. It moved form east to west at a high rate of speed, I have good experience with military craft and this thing moved too quick for any conventional jet. In addition, it was perfectly quiet, no sound no blinking lights and it appeared to be somewhat opaque in the center but yet retained some translucent effect as well, if it passed under a star it seemed as if the star would fade but not dissappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a it dissappeared to the west and we regained our ability to actually talk, my 2 friends went inside to warm up but I stayed, EXACTLY 11 minutes after this sighting 2 military jets possibly F-15 or F-16 fighters came from the southwest and rocketed passed my home heading northwest at a high rate of speed, the classic sonic boom trailing behind, blinking lights etc... I have seen them many times, they were defenitely fighter jets scrambled probably from Newburgh Stewart Air Base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this is lengthy but keep in mind, the only commercial airport in the area is Westchester County airport and they are RESTRICTED from flying between 11pm and 5:00am that is the law. And that is why the jets were scrambled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date of the Leonid Meteor shower was 18NO01.  We have amended the date here.  PD))<n>

But as I was watching this object which I had centered in the binocular lense, which I thought might be venus I saw a branch slowly come into view in the binocular lense. It came into view much faster than any earth rotation would have on a planet. So it was not venus as I first thought. It was not any type of aircraft known to me. Possibly it could have been one of many earth satellites. But are satellites observable in broad daylight moving so slowly? An email responce to my question would be appreciated.<n>

He yelled at me to come out back to see what I thought it was that he was looking at.  It was rather high up so at the height it was it looked like the shape of a plane, but every 2 or 3 seconds a ball of light (or fire) would drop out of the bottom of it and there was like a circle of smoke or haze around the whole object.  My husband at first thought it might have been a hot air balloon but he thought it was rather high to be that and especially at that time of night.  It moved at a rate of speed similar to an airplane, continuing dropping this light or fire ball.  Gradually it moved to the South West and we lost sight of it.  The whole incident that we witnessed lasted approximately 10 minutes.<n>

A round ,metalic object appeared, flying west, toward the ocean. The &#34;thing&#34; did not make any noise and it did not have any lights, it flew faster than anything i ever saw ( and NO, it was not a meteor, i&#39;ve been star gazing a long time ) and just as it flew out over the ocean it made a very sharp right. It only lasted a few seconds, and then it was gone.I dont know who to tell, but i&#39;m hoping that someone out there was watching the meteor shower and saw the same thing.<n>

Some crossing each other. The sky is dark. There are no clouds. We have few streelights in my neighborhood, and watching these showers has been a hobby of mine since I was in the Naval weather service. I know what satellites look like. I know what weather balloons look like. I know what jets look like. I spend a lot of time star gazing. I know altitudes from my weather days estimating cloud height. With all that in mind, I see from north to south at a REALLY high altitude (These are at the level of cirrus clouds, maybe higher) these two faintly glowing orbs side by side cross the sky at incredible speed (no port or starboard lights, just a faint orangy glow, totally different looking from meterorites). I can see them cross from when they enter my view at the peak of my roof to near the horizon in a matter of about five seconds. My eyes are totally accustomed to the dark. I have never seen anything like these before. I would love to know if anyone else saw them. Everyone keeps trying to tell me they were meteorites, and I know they weren&#39;t. They kept a steady speed, remained in a side by side formation and were a different color than the meteorites.<n>

Enjoy the show, we also observed a few satilites.  We then saw a point of light that we at first believed to be a satelite.  However, it was traveling roughly SE to NW, a direction I haven&#39;t seen before.  The point of light was typical of a satelite:  about the size &amp; brightness of an average star, and moving in a straight line at a typical speed for a satelite.  Within 2&#34;, however, the light momentarily came to a complete stop, and reversed direction.  It then stopped again and began a series of rough circles, stoping for a few minutes after each completed circle.  My friends reported smaller points of light leaving and returning to the object at one point in time (I was watching an appoaching plane, which I thought might have been a reconisance flight from the near-by air force base).  After about a half dozen of these circular trajectories, the object remained motionless, and faded-out with the light of dawn.  We watched this object for about 30&#34;.  The sky was clear.  Its cirlcles were limited to probably no more than 5 degrees of distance.  We feel that a plane, helicopter, and weather balloon can be ruled out.<n>

It&#39;s direction was also too shallow for a meteor. The thing was bright white, round to slight oval-ish, and went in a 10 degree(?)&#34;landing&#34; slope. that&#39;s the part that threw me. I naturally looked for landing lights on it. It went behind the trees, didnt appear to burn up, and I heard no impact. it left no streak like all the other meteors i had seen that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date should be November 18.

The altitude of the object is difficult to gauge but based on the size, speed and  wingspan, from my perspective, it was larger than a 747, traveling 300-600mph at under 10,000 feet.

It then made an abrubt right angle turn to the east, followed by a full clockwise 360 that was approx. one half of your fist size held at arms length. For the next 50 minutes or so we watched this object make similar manouvers along with completely stopping, accelerating instantaniously to approx. 4-5 times the typical satillite speed, sometimes in stacatto bursts. All wittnessed &#34;flight&#34; occured apprx. 45 to 70 degress above the horizon, and covered approx. 30 degrees of the compass. Twice another ver small lite sourch dropped out of the object at a 30 degree angle to the rear and once the same size lite re-enentered the main oject from the same course in reverse. Several times during different manouvers the main object appeared to be elongated with an azure light on one end an a red light on the other.As dawn apprached it was only outlasted by saturn, jupitor, and 3 large stars.This was witnessed by three professional adults and two intelligent 17 year olds. All movements almost appeared to be entirely random and very abrupt.<n>

After watching the &#34;show&#34; for awhile, my Brother-in-law went to a Whataburger (or similar establishment which is open at that hour) because he had an appetite.  I&#39;d seen enough and went inside - I was tired.  My Wife stayed outside, and several minutes later she came in the porch door asking me to come outside and see if I think this is part of the Leonids or not.  She didn&#39;t say what her opinion was.  I walked out, and she was pointing at it. At first I was focusing so far out that I seemed to just focus right past it.  Then she said pointed again, more deliberately.  At that time I saw it. At first it looked similar to some of the shots when that comet/meteor or whatever it was, broke up, in a line, then slammed one of our Planets a few years back.  I then saw that this column of lights was not descending nor were any of the parts fading. Then I realized it wasn&#39;t a naturally ocurring event. It is best described as a series of six (what must have been) large lights, orange in color with a brightness I can best describe as &#34;Low-Glow&#34;.  It was moving slowly and silently from the West when she first saw it, then by the time I got out there it had already begun South East. We both agree that there was a series of six lights.  She remembers round, but I remember them being that of an elipse. (Typical track and field) The lights all appeared to be spaced evenly front to back with the exception of the space in between the 3rd and 4th lights.  There was space there, of a size which was appr. that of the lights themselves.  Within that area, we each recalled dim, seemingly intermittent lighter-colored and smaller lights.  Like a dim,....very dim sparkler.  It was moving in such a way as to give the impression of an airliner in that, the lights were 1,2,3,4,5,6 all in a row with one being on the end it was travelling toward and on down the line, until one was at the trailing end.  I must say,...it certainly is! analogo us to a passenger craft, although no body or surrounding craft could be seen.  The way things were laid out however, a quick description of the light layout and the direction of travel was &#34;similar to the tubular design of a fuselage&#34;.  As we both stood silently watching,...it passed overhead at the appr. speed of a blimp,(no noise)with the look of a fuselage and the quietness of a bird.  It was a starry night and no &#34;structure&#34; was observed. We live within 3 - 4 miles of Houston Intercontinental Airport. I grew up around Eglin AFB and Pensacola NAS, spent 9 years in the Military, (4 USMC / 5 US ARMY SF) and am VERY familiar with military aircraft to include winning awards for same.  &#34;THIS WAS NO CONVENTIAL AIRCRAFT.&#34;  It flew silently over us, appr 1,500 feet to our North, (right over a certain Chevrolet Dealer very near I-45 and 1960, for you locals).  It is proving difficult to gauge the height since I do not know the size of the lights, although I&#39;d say it was probably several hundred feet long. It did not appear to vary in altitude or speed. The lights &#34;seemed&#34; to be large.  It passed by us, heading toward the Airport, which is only 3 - 4 miles away (if that).  Eventually, we lost sight of it due to light-pollution. and our roof.  I am mailing sketches drawn by each of us without collaboration.   The only addition I have is that my Wife did say that when she initially saw it (before I did) it seemed to &#34;move like a snake&#34;, in that it was travelling level, then seemed to hit a bump which it simply made a quick humping motion with each of the six lights doing the same thing at the same spot.  Like a centipede walking over a twig.<n>

I was to meet some friends to watch the Leonid meteor shower.  After dressing in layers to ward off the chill, I stepped out onto my back balcony to see if I could see any shooting stars.  I saw three almost immediately.  I went in and excitedly phoned my friends - It was going to be great!, I said.  I stepped back out again, not wanting to miss anything.  I saw another shooting star, and then two large, luminous triangles appeared over the houses and trees from the north, headed south.  At first I related the illumination to the meteor shower, but when I looked directly at the objects an instinct kicked in that these were NOT stars, and I was witnessing something incredible. I live a block and a half away from the Naval Academy and I am used to Navy flyovers, Blue Angels, etc.  THIS WAS DIFFERENT.  The triangles did not project light to the ground, they themselves were yellowish, white light. Their edges were not sharp, they were slightly rounded with the glow of the light. The light did not fade or throb, it was constant. They appeared to be flying in formation - points facing down, close together, on a diagonal.  Together, they were about the size of a half moon. Their movenment was fluid and quick and they were SILENT.  My field of view is not very wide out my back porch, so I was only able to watch the objects for 7 seconds or so.  Soon after they disappeared from my view, I heard a boat horn sound twice quickly.  It occurred to me that maybe someone on the water saw the same thing, as the objects were headed in the direction of City Dock.  I met my friends on the back campus of St. Johns.  I told them I was pretty sure I had seen UFOs (a first for me, by the way) and quickly described my experience.  They reacted with friendly skepticism.  We were lying on a blanket, enjoying the wonderful meteor shower when I saw the triangles again in the southeast corner of the sky.  I sat up, pointed, and said &#34;Look!!!  There they are!!!&#34;  Thank goodness one friend was ! able to see them.  They were much farther away - about a third of the size they were before, and not as luminous.  They were now reddish orange in color and continued flying quickly in a southeast direction.  Just before they disappeared from our field of view, one triangle broke out of formation and darted ahead.  It was surreal. It seemed as though the triangles were animated - right out of a movie.<n>

I did not file this report until I reasoned everything I saw that night and I went to the Satellite Prediction Report that I recieved from http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/RealTime/JPass/PassGenerator/....the satellite I may have seen was proabably ALOUETTE 1 or RadarSat......but I know for sure that the red lights I saw were not a plane or satellite.

We had been watching for about twenty minutes when I saw objects. They were directly overhead moving from southeast to northwest. I could not tell how high they were, could not make out any detail; except that they were light grey colored, circular, did not have any lights or emit light, and no sound was heard. They appeared to be the size of a pea at arms length. Being near dawn I initially thought they were aircraft with sunlight reflecting off bottom. But the two craft seemed to change course toward and away from each other several times, which I didnt think any plane would do. We watched the for about three minutes, till they went out of site. Continued watching meteors for approx ten more minutes, than went inside to get ready for work.<n>

I set my alarm for 4:30 am to observe the meteor shower on 11/18/01.  Went outside, sat down, and watched the sky for about 10 -15 minutes.  I noticed a star-like object that appeared to be moving very slowly (like a slow airplane)to the south west of my home.  At first, I thought it was an airplane but then realized that it was WAY too high to be an airplane so then I thought that it could maybe be a meteor but it was too slow for that - plus didn&#39;t have a tail.  I watched the object move across the sky and curve back to the right and disappear (or fade out) beside a star.  I thought that it was weird, as I have never seen anything like that before.  I waited about 10 more minutes to see if I could see it again but it never came back.  I got the creeps and went inside! I wouldn&#39;t mind being contacted regarding this sighting, but not sure if it&#39;s anything exciting enough to prompt investigation.<n>

The porch faces south. I was standing in the doorway looking up, catching 3-4 good meteor trails, when I noticed a faint, brownish-amber object (closely resembling the illustration on your site of the May 13, 2001 sighting of a dimly lit craft over Bangalore India) moving NE-SW at a slow rate of speed. It looked like an arrowhead-shaped clump of approx. two dozen or so peanut-brittle colored balls, not 100% solidly in formation, loose, but definitely organized. No sound. Whatever it was, it wasn&#39;t self-illuminated, rather it seemed to be dimly reflecting light from the town below. My best guess is that I was looking at a flock of migratory birds flying at night -- is this common this time of year in the Northwest? However, two things prompted me to make this report to you: (1) the object *did* strongly remind me of the object seen over India; and (2) I just read on the NUFORC site that someone reported seeing a (what I interpreted as a strikingly) similar object in Seattle (about 90 miles due south of me) the same night, albeit earlier.<n>

We got bored so we turned around again but we didn&#39;t keep our eyes off of it and while we were driving away it started to rise up into the air really quick.

I remember because I thought I was seeing two pelicans flying just to the south of me and looked at the clock to see what time it was.  I had never seen pelicans at 4:00 in the morning and 8 miles inland. I could not take my eyes off them and as they came closer I noticed a faint bluish glow to them.  We live in the path of airplanes coming and going from Ft. Lauderdale Airport.  These were not on any of those paths, but were flying at what seemed to be about the same altitude of a plane coming in for a landing. They were coming from the South and headed northeast after they went passed over me.  They were silent, not moving at a tremendously fast rate of speed, it was more like two friends just out cruising the sky together.  But, the part I will never forget was when they got just north east of my view, just before they went out of my sight, the one on the right sort of scooped underneath the other one and back out as if they were playing, or saying, &#34;We see you too.  Bye, now.&#34;  It was the most awsome thing.  I will never forget it.<n>

While I believe I did hear what sounded like a plane engine very distantly, we are also near an Interstate highway, and the tractor-trailer engines have fooled me before, sounding very much like jet engines or small planes as they accelerate, and there was moderate freeway traffic at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate, this pattern of lights seemed to be flying quite high, and unlike plane lights, these lights did not flicker or blink, but remained constant.  I watched this pattern for about 2-3 minutes while it made frequent direction changes, very tight, smooth turns and I eventually lost track of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date should be November 18.

It was pretty cold outside, so I bundled up in layers and took my 2 dogs out with me. Meteor storm was strong and sighted many right away.  Pretty consistent and most noticeable along the horizon in a 360, so I decided to go to the front of my apartment and face South-Southeast to watch. All meteors had long, distinct tails.  I live under one of the main flight paths for the Syracuse airport and I am used to all the planes. About 20 minutes into my watching I noticed  one plane that was going along at a slightly different speed, a little faster than normal for a plane with a very steady, smooth flight. At first I thought it was a plane, but quickly realized it had no landing lights on, no colored or blinking lights either.  This was a strong white light, about the magnitude of one of the planets, and wasn&#39;t blinking.  The shape was circular and it did not appear to be attached to any larger body, just a light. I have to mention here, that it seemed to blend in very well with the star-filled backdrop. If I hadn&#39;t been looking in that exact location, I would have missed it.  I watched it transverse the skyline for approx. 4-5 seconds traveling west to east, and then simply fade out. It did not burn up like the meteors or have a tail, and it was on a straight horizonital flight path.  Sort of freaked out by it and getting cold, I decided to go into the apartment to warm up.  At about 4:45 am I decided to stay inside and watch the storm from my glass door b/c the meteors were certainly strong enough to watch from inside.  There are two trees in my backyard and I have to look through the branches to see the sky, but it worked fine for viewing. It wasn&#39;t long before I noticed a second light just the same as the first, go from above my apartment and over the trees.  This one was slightly lower in altitude and heading from the South to the North. It didn&#39;t go very far in it&#39;s direction before it did the same thing by fading out.  Very excit! ing...di dn&#39;t want to go to bed after this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 34 yr old female. Consider myself very level-headed, I don&#39;t do drugs and I  don&#39;t drink.  I just finished my bachelor&#39;s in geography last year as a returning adult. I work now in the environmental remediation field. And I am an amateur astronomer, and have been since I was 10.  I try to catch every meteor shower that is visible at this latitude, and am used to spotting satellites and identifying planets, constellations, etc. Also I think I should mention that I have had several &#34;sightings&#34; over the years because I am out alot at night. This incident in my experience is a mild one.  I have had other sightings that were alot more bizarre, and started at a very young age.  I could fill out several pages with information from several different cities and in different states.  My most bizarre is a low-flying stingray that looked as if it was cloaked several years ago. Other people that lived along the same lake as myself, described the same kind of craft at other times. All I could think is that it was straight from the scripts of Star Wars or Star Trek.  That was my best sighting...<n>

Saw a string of 10 - 15 tiny, faint lights.  An aura around the lights blended into one semi-transparent cigar shaped object.  Oriented vertically, it moved sideways across the sky.  (One person did not see the lights, only the shape.)  It did not fade or change shape, but it seemed soft/transparent, not solid.  It did not leave a trail.  Moved slowly and steadily, about the speed of a high-flying jet (as seen from the ground).  We noticed it when it was directly above, and watched it until it was obscured by the treeline.<n>

From where i was sitting the meteors were striking from left to right (I don&#39;t know if it makes a difference). Anyway, from the right of the sky appeared an object (it looked like two diamonds a little off-centered) comming from right to left at about half to 3/4 the speed of the meteors. After it reached about 1/2 the way across the sky it split into 2 objects, they stayed at an equal distance from each other and continued across the sky. Ok...now i know some might say it was probably a meteor. But this had no trail, you could distinctly see that it was 2 diamond like objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If it was Sunday morning on the day of the Leonid meteor shower, the date would have been November 18.

11/18/01 03:05|Lake Forest Park|WA|Triangle|55 minutes|I saw a bright, erratically moving light, the movements of which seemed to be beyond the capabilities of any manmade aircraft.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20463.html|117|ndxe200111| I saw a bright, erratically moving light, the movements of which seemed to be beyond the capabilities of any manmade aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went out onto my front porch at just after 3 a.m. to try to view the meteor shower.  Immediately I noticed a bright light to the south and a little west, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  This light was continuously moving up, down and sideways in both directions. Since I could not tell how far the object was from me it is hard to say how far it was moving.  It was not darting across the sky, but it was moving in a tightly contained area, like a firefly in a very small jar.  If I had to guess I would say it was at least a half a mile away, possibly even several miles away, depending on it size. Over the course of the time I observed it, its position slowly moved west and possibly farther away from me, as it seemed to become dimmer.  Its shape was hard to determine because I had no binoculars, but I got the impression of a triangle, and I seemed to see colored lights at times, such as red and green.  The light also seemed to increase and decrease in intensity at times, although it was always quite bright.  My attention was also drawn to another light to its right (west) and slightly closer to the horizon. This light did not appear to be moving and was much dimmer.  It may have simply been a star, but I thought it was interesting that its distance from the first light seemed to stay about the same, even as the first light moved slowly west.  I also got the impression of seeing other lights moving around in the vicinity of the first light, but they were very fleeting and faint.  If this was a conventional aircraft, I cannot understand its movements.  I wondered if maybe it was a helicopter or a balloon, but the quickness of its movements would seem to make this impossible.  There was no particular wind that night that I am aware of.  My home is in Lake Forest Park, but the object was probably over the city of Shoreline or possibly even Seattle.<n>

My fiance said he would call me at my house if he woke up and saw lots of meteors.  He called around 2:30am to let me know that the shower was indeed living up to its hype.  I woke my mom and we grabbed our jackets and headed outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20-25 minutes or so, my mom went inside to grab some lawn chairs...looking up at the sky hurts your neck!  Meanwhile, I was searching the heavens for more meteors.  The weather was nice, but there was a bit of fog coming in from the coast.  It was then that I saw the triangular shaped object moving silently against the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an amatuer backyard astronomer, I am very familiar with the sky...meteors...comets, satellites and the like...and I know that what I saw was nothing of the sort.  It appeared to have three &#34;lights&#34; with one in each corner. I put &#34;lights&#34; in quotes because they were not like any kind of lights I have ever seen on a familiar aircraft.  Most planes and such have sharp, crisp looking lights.  However, the lights on this craft were diffused...more like a glow.  They were of an amber-red color and were large and round.  They appeared to be directly under the craft and not on the sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea how high up it was, but it did not appear to be flying at a high altitude. I followed it as it traveled in a straight line until I lost it.  Unlike other people&#39;s posts, this craft did not stop and turn abrubtly, but just continued on a straight path.  I lost it in the sky because the object itself was very dark.  Without the reflection of the city lights, I probably would not have been able to see it at all! I do not know what I saw that night, but I am of the mentality that it was some sort of government craft.  In this day and age of terrorism, I do not believe that there is a way for ANY kind of foreign craft to be in our atmosphere without the government descending on it instantly and without everyone hearing about it. It is, however, an experience that I will remember and always wonder about.<n>

When I went between two big trucks to block out some bothersome lights I saw out of the corner of my eye what looked at first like several meteors traveling together. When I looked in that direction I did not see any meteors. As I started to look in another direction I noticed something moving across the sky blocking out the stars. That was how I determined the shape. It was triangular, very large, moving slowly in an easterly direction. There were no lights and no noise. It was hard to judge the size of the object but I estimate that if it was flying low (as in 2 or 3 thousand feet it would have been the size of at least a football field. It disapeared behind the truck trailer and I was unable to find it again when I moved around to the other side of the truck.<n>

There were no apparent lights on it, so at first I figured it must have been a balloon or a plastic bag caught up in a breeze. It flew slowly in a straight line, and slowly disappeared as it flew out over the water.  Plastic bags usually don&#39;t do this and aircraft normally have lights on them (this did not), so I shot at it with a 11.6 milliwatt 632nm (green) DPSS laser while it was moving away from my position, but did not see any light reflected back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I can see the beam from this laser slicing through the sky at night, targeting was not an issue; it simply didn&#39;t reflect any of my green light back to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute later, I saw another, smaller one; going in approximately the same direction at approximately the same speed and in approximately the same flight path as the first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shot this one with the laser as it was moving off as well, and *did* manage to hit it several times as I saw the green dot light up on what I believe to be its underside.  After I&#39;d hit it four or five times, it slowed down to almost a stop, abruptly turned to the north, and started moving again; only more slowly.  I half expected the thing to start shooting back at me; but instead, it slowed down again and came to a complete stop. By this time I&#39;d thrown the laser to the floor and kicked it under the bed. Then the UFO just hung there stationary like a one of several of the other stars visible near its position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing it stationary in the sky for 25-30 seconds, it simply winked out as if somebody kicked the plug out of the wall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no visible light sources on them (they appear to have been illuminated solely by reflected light from below), no sound was detectable, and no moving parts were visible.  Their color was sodium yellow; so they may have actually been white or light grey in color; and reflecting light from the sodium vapor lamps illuminating the streets in this area.  And both objects had a slow and rock steady flight; not fluttering, rocking, wavering, rotating, or changing speed/direction except as noted earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size of the first one was approximately that of a small dress shirt button held at arm&#39;s length; the second one appeared to be about half that size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The laser I used has an effective range of only a few thousand feet with this amount of light pollution in the area, so the altitude of the object I actually hit had to be ~3,000 feet or below for me to be able to easily see the spot on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects traversed about 50° worth of sky (a mile or two if they were at this low an altitude) before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I attempted to take pictures, but neither object was large or bright enough to show up on my cheap digital camera.  The pictures came out as just digital noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched the meteor storm &amp; the sky intently for approximately another 90 minutes after this sighting, and did not see anything else out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a full-time museum curator &amp; product evaluator, I do not use drugs, and I haven&#39;t consumed any alcoholic beverages since mid-September.  And I know I wasn&#39;t just seeing things.<n>

The object was crescent-shaped, colored a medium grey (judging by the color reflected from the city lights below), and seemed to have a texture like it was made from dozens of small balls or spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew very slowly from north-northeast to south-southwest, and was accompanied by a very faint rumbling, engine-like noise which I could make out over the normal nighttime sounds of downtown Seattle.  Once it was nearly overhead, it turned slowly west and faded from view, and the rumbling noise faded away with it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The size was approximately that of a thumbnail held at arm&#39;s length, and it flew with the rounded portion of the crescent shape aimed forward.  There were no light emitters of any type visible on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its height could not be accurately estimated; I have only the amplitude of its &#34;engine&#34; noise to base any guess upon.  And if I tried to guess using only that, it would have been at least 5,000 feet in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m on the approach path for commercial airliners, and I know what they look and sound like from varying distances.  This was *not* a commercial flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> According to my handheld GPS, I&#39;m located at 47°36&#39;23N by 122°19&#39;51W.  This is in downtown Seattle near the monorail terminus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first of three unidentifyable objects I will be reporting on tonight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, from my decidedly poor vantage point, highly restricted viewable area, and severe light pollution conditions, I still observed approximately 150 meteors between 1am &amp; 4am; with only one being very substantial. The projectile itself glowed an eye-piercing whitish violet and was surrounded by a darker violet coma; and the long tail was green &amp; white with violet &amp; blue-violet along its edges.  It&#39;s a fair guess it left some elements in our upper atmosphere that aren&#39;t even on the periodic table yet.  All but three of the meteors I saw were Leonids.<n>

I braced myself against the corner of my house and took a picture of it with my digital camera with a telephoto lens at the maximum.  When I viewed the image it didn&#39;t really present change from the way I viewed it with the naked eye.  So, I decided to download to my computer and then digitally magnify it.  As I magnified it started taking on a shape up 200X before it became distorted.  It definitely was metallic and was saucer shape.  It appears that a light is on top but may be a reflection of the sun.  I thought maybe this could be a satellite but it remained stationary and didn&#39;t move for approx. 2 hours.

As we were looking for meteors, my wife commented that all she saw was an airplane &#34;or something&#34; just above the horizon, due east of us.  When she mentioned it, we started observing it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was too far away from us to make out any details of a craft.  I can only guess, but I&#39;d say it was ~5 miles away from us.  It was a white light, looked about the intensity of landing lights on a commercial airliner.  It was blinking very rapidly with a very consistent strobe-like rhythm.  The strobe frequency seemed almost like an everyday jetliner, however it lacked the tell-tale red nav light on the top. Since we couldn&#39;t see any meteors due to the clouds, we watched it for a bit.  The light moved a bit from the north to the south (approximately 3-4 degrees) and maintained what appeared to be a very low altitude.  I guessed it might be a car driving up a road and the headlights appearing to pulsate due to roadside trees crossing their path.  Just as I said this, the light jumped straight up ~10 degrees above the horizon.  The movement was deliberate and VERY swift. This was certainly not a car and no aircraft that I&#39;ve ever seen could have ascended this quickly.  It moved an apparent 5 degrees in much less than a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were somewhat surprised at this movement, but as we are all fairly skeptical and scientific minds, we again guessed this must have been some sort of aircraft.  As we watched it began to move south, but as it moved, it bounced up and down very, very quickly.  Again, I can&#39;t stress enough that common airplanes or helicopters do not move this fast or in this fashion.  As it headed south it slowed dramatically and then headed north again, it appeared not to even stop when changing direction.  It accellerated just as quickly as it decellerated after reversing direction. This change of direction was simply amazing.  It seemed to have the dexterity of a small insect.  It moved up and down and north to south for several minutes as we watched in awe, all the time trying to understand what the heck we were watching.  I suppose the natural thing to do is to try and explain it away, but there was nothing that we could think of that could maneuver like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes of this, it travelled deliberately south/southwest of us and passed behind a hill that obscured our vision.  The other side of the hill that we could see was the town of Parker, which had many lights of its own and made it difficult to track.  We saw many lights that seemed to match this one, but couldn&#39;t be sure as they didn&#39;t appear to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stayed for three hours at that location and eventually saw the meteors.  The light we were watching was very clearly *not* a meteor.<n>

I filmed for 3hrs and looked at the film and had a reaction from the star, at the same time the dog in the back yard began to howl for long periods of time. This is not the first time I&#39;ve seen objects from the star, but this time I have it on tape (VCR). I don;t know much about space but I do know what I have seen and have for a long time.

However, that is only an educated guess on our part.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had gone out on the balcony to see if there were any meteors, because I didn&#39;t think I would be up early enough to see the climax of the meteor shower the next morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a very bright light in the sky, southeast of my home, and southeast of Black Mountain (I&#39;m pretty much on Black Mountain).  At first I thought it was a star, but since I had been looking at the sky for the past few nights, this &#34;star&#34; seemed out of place.  It was very bright, bluish white, and seemed to twinkle more than than other stars.  It was bigger than the other stars, and didn&#39;t have a star shape.   I went back in the house, and came out about 15 minutes later.  The star was still there... still bright... still flickering.  I dont have a telescope, so I tried looking at this object through binoculars.  While I couldn&#39;t make out any shape, this object was a bright, bluish white light, and I could see red flashes.  I thought I saw what appeared to be other color flashes of blue and green, but those might have been illusions.  I did see clear flashes of red light, however.  Very clear.  I had never seen this in a star, so I sat and watched this object for a good half an hour, both with binoculars and without.  It just sat there.  There were lots of planes out at that hour, and the visibility in that part of the sky was very clear.  I thought maybe it was just a plane flying off into the distance, and figured I would see the light get smaller and smaller and just disappear, but it didn&#39;t.  It maintained the same level of brightness, and the red flashing lights - appearing to come from various areas of the border of the light - were very distinct.  It was definitely an unidentified object to me, so I went into the house again to see if I could locate a telephone number to call and report this.  I didn&#39;t know who to call, so looked on the internet and found your site.  Still not sure of whether to report this, I went back outside.  At that point, what I saw appeared to be gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still not sure I should be sending this in, but I figured that maybe someone else saw what I saw.  If anyone was looking at the sky tonite, surely they must have seen this.  And if others reported it as well, then numerous reports would only lend to the credibility of the appearance of whatever this was that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont need anyone to contact me unless they need other information.  But if there&#39;s someone there who can suggest a better way to look at such objects - e.g., an inexpensive telescope; or, what to do if I should see something like this again, well I would certainly appreciate any information.  Email contact is fine.   I checked the box that says there was an aura or haze around the object.  This might have been caused by the binoculars. I don&#39;t know for certain.<n>

It was really early so I would have been surprised to see anything but a few sporadic meteors. My real excitement happened around 10:30! There were 3 sets in all and showed up approximately 1-2 minutes apart.  The first set, there were 3 in this first set (if i recall correctly), was travelling from south to north, from approximately the Cetus constellation through perhaps as far as the tail of Draco before fading out as if they had entered the atmosphere.  They did not burn out or burst like a meteor might, the just faded.  I was looking straight up from my location and facing east.  If I had to guess at a speed, they were moving at somewhere over 3 times the speed of sound, but nowhere near the speed of what you&#39;d expect a meteor to travel at, and being a poor judge of speeds that high I could be way off.  They were in formation and did not appear to move apart or together.  I saw 2 more sets that were approximately the same in charateristics.  They were in formation, and they were at the same speed.  The 2nd set contained 4, and the 3rd set contained 2.  There may have been more, but thinking this was part of the meteor shower, and very different than any other I&#39;d ever seen, I ran inside to grab the nearest co-worker to let them know that the meteors were really cool looking!  We were back outside within 3 minutes, but no other appearances were made by these odd objects that I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The easiest description I could give of these objects were that they looked like the effects given to photon torpedos...ya, like in star trek! The had a hazy redish-orange effect while they were seemingly entering the earth&#39;s atomsphere.  The shape that I recall was semi-rectangular; maybe a 1x3 or 1x4 ratio.  Other than that, I couldn&#39;t make out any other specific traits about them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I said, these...things....were definitely NOT meteors!  I saw them all within about a 3 or 4 minute period and at around 10:30pm.<n>

While looking off into the southern horizon, I noticed a green light. The light first started as a white light and slowly changed to a light green color. There were no &#34;Flashing&#34; lights or red lights, as associated with aircraft. Also the light stayed on a straight path, and was seen for miles. The light also was moving at a speed which seemed out of the norm for local aircraft i.e. jet fighters. There was no sound with the object which made me think it might have been an &#34;early meteor&#34;, but as the object continued into the distance, I noticed there was no dust trail as seen with meteor&#39;s. Also the object did not appear to be &#34;Burning&#34; or a &#34;Fireball&#34;. The light continued into the distance until it became to small to see.<n>

I stepped outside my apartment (near intersection of E. Del Mar Blvd. and Hill Ave.) this evening to walk to my car and happened to notice two glowing shapes crossing the sky from the North-West. They were irregularly shaped, lumpy, and fuzzy. The best way I can summarize their appearance is to describe them as glowing jellyfish. They seemed to changed shape as they floated silently together across the sky, finally disappearing into the haze above the South-East horizon. They were probably five to ten diameters apart from each other, and about doubled their distance in the time that I watched them. They were side-by-side, although the West-most object lagged slightly. The really strange thing about them was that they each had several blobs inside them that were glowing brighter than the rest of the object. These blobs moved, sort of tumbling around inside. I&#39;m sure there are others out there who got a better view of these objects than me. Many people in the LA area must have seen them, especially since there might have been people out watching the meteor shower that&#39;s supposed to be happening tonight. A plane was also in the sky, traveling East to West.<n>

Nov 17th, while viewing the Leonid Meteor shower from a scenic overlook on the Cherohala Skyway outside of Tellico Plains, TN, I noticed what at first looked like a bright star, about 150% the size of the planet Venus, above the ridge of a distant mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked back at the object a second, and third, time, I could see that something was just &#34;different&#34; with this &#34;star&#34;.  At this point I asked the two people with me to take a look as well.  With their younger eyes they verified that it couldn&#39;t be a star, insomuch as it was showing two separate colors, green, and, yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, we pulled out the binoculars for a closer look, and could just discern an irregular shape, as well as a twinkling, or pulsing of the colors.  Also, we noticed that the object had risen higher above the ridge line, and seemed to be a bit further away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our total viewing time was approximately 30 minutes before we were forced to leave the mountain due to the cold temperature. As we departed, the object was still in it&#39;s position, ruling out the possibility of an aircraft. Also, with the 25 mph (est) winds that were blowing, a weather ballon would have long since been blown away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This one goes down as &#34;unidentified&#34; in my book.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been observing a star, perhaps &#34;Sirius,&#34; which rises in the east.

This was shortly after September 11th 2001 and we all knew there was a restriction on ANY aircraft flying in the NYC vicinity, so we found it even stranger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly afterward we heard the sound of sonic booms in the distance and 2 (which were EASILY distinguishable) military jets perhaps f-15 or f-16 flew over head at extremly high speeds from east to west in the same path of the first object, as if in pursuit, my girlfriend came running out because the boom from there engines RATTLED the house.. and she was not sure what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very strange, very real....<n>

She was babysitting two children, 4 yrs. old and 6 yrs. old, who were with us. My friend went into the store and I sat in my truck with the kids and waited for her. It was about 5:30 pm, and the sun was going down. The sky was very clear and still a light color but the ground was almost as dark as night. The younger child pointed into the sky and said that she saw a light in the sky, which I&#39;m sure was the crescent moon. When I looked up to see what it was, I saw the moon, which is what I think she was looking at. Then I looked to the side of the moon a considerable distance and I saw a dark object in the sky that was shaped like a plump Hershey&#39;s Kiss, or perhaps a teardrop with a slightly flattened-out botton. It was black in a apearance with a pointed top and seemed to have an extremely faint aura around it that my friend also noticed. There were no lights on it, and it made no sound whatsoever. It was due east of us, as I was looking in the direction of the Mississippi River from the store&#39;s parking lot in the Beechwood area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of my truck partway and stared at it. It moved closer very slowly at a slight angle coming from left to right. I stood and watched it for about 3 or 4 minutes. It got about 30-50% larger as it seemed to come closer. Then it stopped moving and hovered in place. At this point it seemed to be at an altitute of between 500 and 600 ft. if my speculations of distance and size of the object were correct. I watched it for about 2 or 3 minutes, and noticed that several other people in the parking lot were also staring at it. A black couple in their late twenties spoke to me briefly about it, and I asked the man if it seemed like it was about 500 yards away, no more than 1000. He agreed that it was about that far away. My friend came out of the store and watched it with me. After another minute or two, it began to slowly move upward. I drove Sharon, the kids, and myself toward the object into the lot of a strip mall about a mile closer. I stopped and got out and we stared at the object until it became too small to see. It took about 10 minutes for the object to ascend out of sight. As it rose, it did not move to one side or another whatsoever. It just moved exactly straight upwards. I estimate the diameter of the object to have been at least 15 ft. and may possible have been 3 times that size. It was difficult to estimate it&#39;s size without knowing it&#39;s true distance from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could not have been a balloon of any kind, because a balloon would have moved to one side or another (or gotten larger or smaller depending on your perspective, as it rose. There would have undoubtably been air currents somewhere between ground level and 1,000 ft. of altitude which would have caused a balloon to move sideways to some degree as it rose that far upwards. It could not have been an aircraft, such as a helicopter, because it made no sound, and helicopters make a lot of noise with their large props, and can be easily heard from a few miles away. If it were any kind of machine with a piston or turbine engine and a propeller, it would have made a lot of sound. Furthermore, law requires that all aircraft have blinking lights so that they are visible by the pilots of other aircraft, yet this object was completely black in appearance.<n>

The sky was clear.  It was early twilight.  Almost directly overhead was a triangular shaped craft.  completely quiet.  The triangle would be roughly a 70 - 70 - 40 degree triangle with the apex of the 40 degree angle apparently the front of the craft.  The apex of the nose was blunt as if the front few feet were removed.  It left a distinct triangle with a square front end.  Along each edge (left and right) was a defined area that was slightly lighter extening front to back and possibly 8 to 10 feet wide.  In essence, it looked like two stripes, one along each edge of the triangle (but not the back edge).  Set in each of the stripes and spaced equidistant from each other and within the area of the stripe were circles that looked like dull dome lamps.  The circles were perhaps 6 to 8 feet in diameter.  I believe there were 5 along each edge.  I don&#39;t recall if there were these circles along the rear edge or not. In the area between the two edge stripes and starting perhaps half-way back from the leading edge of the craft was an area that appeared to be somewhat darker than the rest of the craft.  It was uniform in color but only a part of a shade darker.  The curious thing here is that while I&#39;ve described a craft with stripes and lights, it was very pale against the twilight sky.  I don&#39;t believe that I would have seen it if I hadn&#39;t just by luck looed straight at where it was.  The color was almost the color of th sky with just a little difference.  The overall shape, the stripe area, the large circular lights were definite shapes but the color was so weak as to be almost blended with the ambient image of the sky.  There was no sound.  I waited and listened closely for several seconds to see if I could perceive sound.  There was none. I live next to a little league ball field.  The field lighting was on.  I almost believe that reflected light ! from the field was what enabled me to see this thing.  From a size standpoint, there is no way to know.  If the visual cues from other aircraft I know are valid, and if the altitude was from 1500 to maybe 2000 feet, then the craft was about 120 feet long and 50 or 60 feet wide at the back.  If that was valid, then I would estimate the speed at around 100 to 150 knots.  If the size cues were wrong, then the actual size could be anything.  We live onthe edge of an extended traffic pattern for Scottsdale Airport.  It was curious that the craft had no  beacon or anticollision lights.  That makes me believe that it should have been much higher than I think because of the danger of collision in an airport traffic pattern. I don&#39;t recall the altitude requirements to cross over the airport control space but I think it&#39;s around 7500 feet.  If the craft was at that altitude it would have been enormous andwould have been moving at perhaps 300 or 400 knots.  I&#39;m a former military pilot.  I know aircraft.  My distance vision is excellent.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.  I can say what it wasn&#39;t.  It was no known aircraft in the inventory of any country I&#39;m aware of.  It was not a hang glider, an ultra-light, baloon, F11, B2, Beechcraft Starship, Dick Rutan creaation, or anything else I can think of.  It was not shaped like a blimp and besides, you can hear them easily.  I watched the craft for approximately 10 seconds until it disappeared behind a tree that blocked my vision.  It held a steady course, altitude, and speed - traveling from southeast to northwest.  I have filed a report with MUFON some time ago.  I just found out about your group today on the radio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness occupies a position of considerable responsibility, and has a very strong technical background.  PD))<n>

I saw a cigar shaped object in the western sky about 60 degrees. 3 bright round white lights shaped like this, --0--0--0--.  At first I thought it was an airplane because it&#39;s around the Burbank airport area and I see lots of airplanes around this way. Object would be about 2 inches across at arms length. What struck me funny was the 3 white big round lights. I&#39;ve never seen them look that way on an airplane and thought I had an unusual perspective. I expected to see the plane turn and have a different view, however, I had to avert my eyes and when I looked up again a few seconds later the object was gone. It was a mostly clear day, a few clouds further off in the distance and at a much greater altitude.  I observed a plane coming east bound several minutes later with no lights on. (This is the second of two unsimilar objects seen while driving LA area freeways this week, and I also reported the other. This is the first time I have ever seen anything unusual, let alone two in one week).<n>

She was driving in my car along HWY 101 near Coos Bay Oregon at around 1130pm, this is her normal work commute.  She noticed a Bright pulsate white light above the car.  She looked a head of her and saw the object.  She then was under the object and directly beneath it. It was high in the sky but she had to close the moon roof due to the distracting light.  The object followed her for about 9 miles.  She could see the reflection of the pulsating light in the black paint of the car.  Then before she entered the outskirts of Coos Bay it disappeared, not flying off, but vanished.  No missing time was found just this odd sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed that night, but our first suspicion is the planet, Jupiter.  It would be been very bright in the sky, and almost due south of the driver, I.e. directly ahead of and above her vehicle.  If there were not TWO bright objects in the sky, our guess would be she was being &#34;followed&#34; by Jupiter.  Many people have reported Jupiter and Venus to the National UFO Reporting Center.

Up near the Manastash Canyon. On our way out of the canyon we stopped one last time to listen for coyotes when we noticed a bright light come up over the ridge. It was fairly small and moved slowly. We thought nothing of it until it started bouncing from left to right quickly. It would move right fast then pause then move left. As it moved side to side it was slowly rising up. After about 5 minutes (a guess) it just stopped, slowly sunk below the ridge again. We then proceeded to get out of the canyon as fast as possible! We will be going back on 11/16/01 to try and photograph the UFO if possible.<n>

It stopped for only 4 more mintues but that was long enough for me to get what was happening.  It was emitting long beams of light in a pattern 1,2. then stop 3,4. then stop.  I hurried inside to get my binoculars but by the time I came out it had started moving again.  The other two Fireball&#39;s went in opposite directions.

It was moving incredibly fast but there was no sound and before I knew it it was out of view..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried looking for it again and managed to see it and the strangest part of all was that it had to have been flying upside-down because it was as if I was looking at a plane, a very unusual plane for that matter, from above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another strange thing happened..one of the other astronomers was using an astronomy program on his lap top to move his telescope to certain astronomical bodies and when I saw this thing the program went crazy, sifting through dozens of star charts at a rapid pace then shutting down.

It didn&#39;t seem to make any noise as My dog who howls at sirens, aircrafts and hot air balloons was not even aware it was there.  It moved very slowly.  I watched it for about 3 minutes then lost it behind some trees.  I ran into the house to look out of an upstairs window but I couldn&#39;t see it anymore.

I was smoking a cigarette and looking at the stars(The ground visibility was a little hazy, sky visibility was completely clear.) when I saw an object flying east almost directly overhead.  It was shaped like a triangle, more so like a boomerang(my friend said like a giant glider.)  It seemed to be about the same size across as a jetliner(without knowing exact altitude.)  It was completely matte-black, not reflective at all, with no lights or beacons on it at all.  It was darker than the night sky which was lit by streetlamps.  It also made no sound at all, completely quiet.  Its&#39; rate of speed was comparable to a plane on landing approach, I believe.  It flew over our heads at a 120 degree angle. The downtown St. Paul airport is approximately 3 miles away from our location.  There were no planes in the direct area where I saw the object.  When I first saw the craft I immediately stopped the inane conversation I was having with my friend and pointed out the object.  He saw it immediately and we both watched it fly out of sight over the building.  We were both completely flabbergasted.  The whole event lasted between 8 and 10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend is a ((deleted))l engineer and I am a ((deleted)) officer.  We both went to college at the University of Wisconsin.

In the sky was a orange sphere seemingly hovering in the sky.  It then split into two objects spaced a little apart. Then one of those two split again and it formed another object making the total three. I don&#39;t know if it was an actual split or if others came from directly behind the ones already there, but the three separate spheres were there.  They were first in a horizontal line, then overlapped each other. Then the one sphere spit back into three except in a vertical line and both of the others split off at once, not one then the other. The top one in the vertical line then stayed as the other two moved off and formed a triangle shape. It stayed like this for a minute or so and then went back to one sphere. That is when we went inside again. I have no idea how long it was out there after we went inside. I had also seen a single sphere in the sky earlier in the week, but nothing like the show on this night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I looked out the window and did not see anything, but did not go outside.

Thinking it was a jet plane I went back inside. The noise continued getting louder, I again went out into the back yard but did not see anything but stars. I went into our living room where my husband, son, and son&#39;s friend were watching TV and asked &#34;can&#39;t you hear that&#34;, they said yes but thought it was just a jet going over. I told them that was what I thought too, but it must be more than one and going very slow. They went outside to the front of the house and came rushing back in and said you have to come out and see this. We all went out to the front yard and could see this huge diamond shape with elongated bottom, with a light at each tip and an orange light in the middle. It gradually moved off to the northwest. I went back inside and within 5 minutes they yelled it was coming back. We all watched as it traveled over our home traveling southeast, when it got over Boyne City all of a sudden all of the outside lights started to spin around. Shortly the light on the right side veered off over Lake Charlevoix, which was to the west, while rest of the craft continued on its course, but soon the lone light came back and was heading the same direction as the large craft. It traveled until it was out of sight. The next day at work, two of my co-workers said they had also heard the noise, but had not gone outside to investigate. I then started calling law enforcement agencies, FAA, and local airports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to find out anything.<n>

I got into my van and followed the object south until it disappeared, but upon returning to my home, 10 minutes later, it was back traveling south to north.  Again I followed the object north of town.  I could not see the object any longer, but did see four (I am guessing) military jets flying in formation over our small village apparently in search of this object.  Calls to the local police only verified that others had reported a strange object and that the FAA was notified.  No other information was ever forthcoming.  Our village is located at 45 degrees latitude, 80 degrees longitude.<n>
11/15/01 19:15|Bangalore (India)||Unknown|2-3 minutes|At the outset, I would like to make it clear that at the time of the sighting, I had scant knowledge of the internet (way back in 2001)|4/13/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74552.html|164|ndxe200111| At the outset, I would like to make it clear that at the time of the sighting, I had scant knowledge of the internet (way back in 2001) and was not aware of the existence of a UFO report centre, whether online or offline. I was 16 years old and was studying in the second year of college. I do remember that I recorded the EXACT date and time of the sighting along with a verbal description of the nature of the UFO, but cannot find the original record anywhere. I also wish to state that the reason I am submitting this report is because of a second sighting I made barely a week ago, in the same country but a different city hundreds of miles away from the first and a full nine years later. I am 24 years old and havehad two sightings in my life thus far.<n> <n><n> Situation and description:<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was summer and I was on the terrace at our place in Bangalore, India, at around seven in the evening.  My brother had just headed back downstairs and I lingered on for a while longer as the weather was pleasant.  I lay down on the ground and stared at the sky star gazing. I don’t remember which constellation I was looking at exactly, but I spotted a bright shining light from the corner of my eye, a little distance away from the spot I was looking at.   As I first looked at it I thought it was a star because that’s exactly what it appeared to be (almost as bright as Sirius). Then I realized it was moving, albeit very slowly, to the right.   As I watched it suddenly seemed to accelerate for a while before stopping abruptly and changing direction at an angle of ninety degrees.  I sat up as I thought my eyes were tricking me, but the object did not stop and was definitely not an illusion or a trick of light.  It stood out against the pitch black sky, which ! I thought was remarkable considering Bangalore’s light pollution.  The object continued to zig-zag along a roughly linear axis,and it was this zig-zag motion at high speed that amazed me for I have never seen an aircraft capable of such abrupt change of direction at such high speeds before.  As it proceeded along its path it changed seemed to me it was changing colour, from the dull yellow, starlike tinge it originally had(at least when I spotted it) to blue and finally to a dull green flicker.  This ‘phenomenon’ lasted for a good couple of minutes, disappearing behind the silhouette of the taller building next to our own for some twenty-thirty seconds before reappearing on the other side.  It then disappeared in a matter of moments, with the intensity of light decreasing to zero and vanishing. This was all I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen weather balloons before, and I am absolutely certain what I saw was no such thing for without adequate propulsion I think it is impossible to move as rigidly and discretely as this body did.  Same reasoning also rules out any form of burning/incandescent matter floating toward the earth.  As for the object itself I know absolutely nothing of its form, shape or even size because all I saw was a bright spot of light.  Curiously enough, this was a few months after news of the Mir space station’s ‘demise’ and its break-up in the atmosphere.  Clearly this had nothing to do with the ‘sighting’, in my opinion, considering the time-gap between the two events and the obvious impossibility of debris acquiring wings of its own and flying about.  Also, there is an air-force base in Bangalore, but I enquired about and have been told Indian Airforce crafts are NOT allowed to fly over the city airspace. And in any case I know India isn’t capable of such ‘top-secret’ flight testing programmes, yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no choice but to brand this sighting an UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

This is a personal report...about 20 minutes ago coming back from town..we are in the country...there was about 5 planes circling all over the area...WE SAW A HUGE RED BALL...people pulled off the road and watched! I kept driving to try and follow it.  It was not moving for a long time until the planes came in ...I kept flashing my hi-beams at it and it came very close to us!  Then it left somewhere to the east...It looked like it was landing somewhere...as it was decending and I lost sight of it in the trees! My daughter was with me and my husband was in another vehicle. He saw it too...we went looking for it but couldn&#39;t find it! Too awesome!  Damn I wanted to see them! This was as we were driving out of Enumclaw, WA into the country towards an area here that is a state park called Nolte State Park and where I live. I could see this red glow in the distance.  I told my daughter to look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She,(((name deleted)) is 6 Years old), did and then she started pointing the planes out to me that were coming into the area, about 5 or 6 of them. I was driving in the direction the red glow was...the closer I got the bigger it got of course...I was so excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was traveling north and when I first saw it it was straight ahead a little to my left or a tad NW.  It traveled from West to East into the Cascade foothills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The planes were government planes...I have been watching them for three years now circling this area.  And this is not the first time that I have seen these red balls...I also saw a very, very huge green florescent one here too.  Anyway these planes are also silent and can do some real fancy manuvers like a helicopter can! (My son and I saw a plane like this chase another mulitcolored UFO at another time.) Well this time the planes came in from all directions but kept their distance somewhat, not chasing really, kinda of like just looking...but they had to see us watching and my beams blinking like crazy! When they got closer and I was flashing my hi-beams the ball came in closer to my spot on the road but I lost it behind the trees...the planes were gone too...a few minutes later I saw another three planes looking around...so I don&#39;t know what happened to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball was also silent and it just looked like the red glow of a stop light only fuzzier...and It was big! If you hold your arm out fully extended and have your thumb up, it was the size of your thumbnail.  That was how it appeared at the time just before it started its descent(?)... but my husband was a minute behind me and he saw it more in the east and it was about double the size of the usual plane lights he said.<n>

Three cars were pulled off to the side of road to observe the orb.  The witness flashed her hi-beam lights at the orb.  The orb came very close to the witness&#39;s car.  The witness drove and followed the orb for several minutes and eventually lost sight of it behind the trees.  The witness&#39;s husband was following behind and also saw the orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was reported to the National UFO Reporting Center on the same evening that it occurred.  Subsequently MUFON investigators Dr. Joseph Ryan and William Puckett investigated the sighting.  The results of the investigation are described below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> INVESTIGATIVE NOTES We made two trips to the Enumclaw area to investigate the alleged sighting.  The first trip was made in December of 2001.  In this trip we did not interview the witness, but we surveyed the area, took pictures, and made some environmental readings to ascertain anything unusual in the area.  We also talked to the police dispatcher to find out the police received any ufo reports recently.  The dispatcher told us that the last report that he received was about six years ago.  The dispatcher did not recall the details the six-year old sighting.  When taking measurements of  the environment  we did find extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic readings to be above normal for an area removed from electrical interference.  Readings of around 5 milliGauss were obtained close to Nolte State Park where the orb was observed.  (Although no clear guidelines exist for exposure to ELF it is recommended that exposure not exceed 2 milliGauss.) We observed nothing else unusual about the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On February 9, 2002 we made an appointment to visit with the witness and her daughter.  We conducted an extensive interview including a tour of the area where the red orb was sighted.  The results of our interview are briefly described below: The witness drove us through the area where the orb was sighted.  The area was along Cumberland road to the northeast of Enumclaw.  (See road highlighted in red on the map.)  The orb was first sighted when the witness saw two towers each of which had a red light.  The red light appeared to be close to the towers.  The light then moved closer and grew larger.  The witness then saw three cars parked along the road and the passengers were outside observing the orb.  (The witness did not know any of the other witnesses.) The witness continued driving towards the orb and flashed her lights.  At that time the orb moved very close to the witness&#39;s car to the point where her entire view was obscured by the red orb.  At this point the witness was driving under 10 mph, but doesn&#39;t know how she could steer.  She felt as if the orb was guiding her.  (This was interesting because at the point where the orb obscured her view a steep curve was immediately ahead.)  The witness had the impression that the orb was intelligent or under intelligent control because of the way it responded when she twice flashed her lights.  The witness said that orb emitted no heat, sound, or odor.  The witness also said that she had no fear of the orb at the time and neither she nor her daughter suffered ill effects during or after the sighting.  The witness did say that her van began malfunctioning the day after the sighting.  It is possible that the van problems were due to effects other than the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness did not strike the orb with her car, but either went through it or believes that it evaded her somehow when she otherwise should have struck it when it was directly in front of her, and so close that it blinded the entire road from her vision.  She traveled quite some distance with the orb in this &#34;blinding position,&#34; but did not recall how far.  She estimated that she drove for approximately 8 seconds while so &#34;blinded.&#34;  She negotiated turns perfectly during this time, however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Subsequent to the &#34;close encounter,&#34;  the witness lost sight of the orb when it moved behind some tall trees.  The orb was moving eastward towards the Cascade Mountains.  The witness noted that some aircraft were pursuing the orb before it moved out of her view.  The witness then returned home, but went out on her rear deck to see if she could sight the orb.  The orb was not sighted, but the witness noticed several strange aircraft in the area which had been pursuing the orb throughout much of time that it was in view.  These aircraft are triangular shaped and sometimes move quite slowly and hover.  The witness said that on this particular night one particular one was hovering close to her home. She estimated that the size of the triangular aircraft were about &#34;fighter aircraft&#34; size.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes after the witness returned home her husband arrived.  He was following behind the witness and also saw the orb.  The witness also said that her husband saw the aircraft &#34;hovering&#34; from their home.  The husband has not been interviewed.  The only other witness was the six year-old daughter of the witness.  The daughter was interviewed in the presence of the witness and also saw the red orb.  The daughter drew us a picture of a spherical orb which suggested that it was quite close to the ground.  The daughter told us that the orb was about the size of a car tire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the witness&#39;s neighbors heard a strange sound on the night of the sighting of the red orb.  The neighbor did not see anything unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other mystery associated with this sighting is the strange aircraft that witness said were pursuing the orb.  The witness says that she has seen these aircraft on a regular basis during the past three years.   She says that the aircraft are triangular shaped, can rapidly change speed or direction, fly low, and sometimes hover.  The lights on the triangular aircraft were almost consistent with modern USAF aircraft - two bright white lights center and front and both a &#34;blue&#34; and red light at points along the sweep of the triangle on either side.  If the &#34;blue&#34; lights that she observed/observes were/are actually green, the lights would match current conventions for placement of night lights.  She was absolutely sure of the color &#34;blue,&#34; however.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witness said on one occasion that she could see two pilots and could make out of the pilot&#39;s features (blond hair).  The pilot was clearly human.  The witness has a job in which she works in the early hours of the morning.  She sights these aircraft in the early morning hours.  Sightings are more frequent on clear nights (95% of the time).  She says that the aircraft come from the Auburn area and sees them coming and going in the general direction of Auburn.  The witness said that the aircraft fly quite low (75 to 1000 feet) and generally fly from west to east (when coming from Auburn).  Sometimes the lower flying aircraft appear to simply &#34;disappear&#34; behind trees that are relatively close or even house tops right across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition to witness testimony, we decided to obtain radar data for the time period when the witness had the sighting.  The radar data did not reveal any aircraft in the vicinity of Cumberland Road where the witness sighted the orb.  However, radar data did show several slow moving aircraft to the north and west of Enumclaw.  This is the general direction where the witness frequently sights these aircraft.  (See map.  On the map The aircraft are coded with red arrows which show the direction of movement.  Estimated speeds are also shown.)  The radar data shows several aircraft moving quite slowly (under 70 mph).  Two aircraft were observed flying at speeds of conventional aircraft (200 and 360 mph respectively).  The radar data showed the normal heavy traffic in and out of SeaTac Airport.  As expected these aircraft were moving at more conventional speeds expected for commercial aircraft.  A check of weather data on this night shows light southerly to calm winds at weather stations throughout the Puget Sound area.  Skies were partly cloudy with weather radar showing some widely scattered rain showers.  The witness said that it was clear in the area where the orb and other aircraft were observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We also contacted both Whidbey Island Naval Air Station and McChord Air Force Base to establish if any military aircraft were in the area at the time of the sighting of the orb.  The Air Force said that no aircraft were in the area on the evening of the sighting.  The Navy said that two F18&#39;s were flying from Miramar into Payne Field at Everett, but were above 15,000 feet.  These aircraft flew over the Enumclaw area about 6 pm which is about 45 minutes before the witness sighted the orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another note of interest is that the same witness has sighted other orbs in the area.  She sighted a green orb two years back which she describes as about the size of a full moon.  She also sighted another red orb over Enumclaw which was more &#34;fish&#34; or &#34;cigar&#34; shaped. We did not record when this sighting had occurred.  We have a record that red orbs have been sighted over the Enumclaw area before.  In February, 1996 a red orb was sighted.  A picture was snapped of this orb.  We showed the picture to the witness, after the interview, and she said that the picture looked exactly like what she and her family saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CONCLUSION/SUMMARY This case has been extensively investigated.  Detailed interviews have been conducted, meteorological and radar data have been collected, inquiries to FAA, Whidbey Naval Air Station, and McChord Air Force Base have been made.  We have collected electromagnetic readings in the vicinity of the sighting, taken pictures, and have performed a general survey of the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The red orb in this case is unexplained.  The case is weakened somewhat by the lack of  &#34;unrelated witnesses.&#34;  The case is strengthened by virtue of the fact that other red orbs have been sighted in the area.  It is pure conjecture to guess at what the orb was.  Some scientists believe that orb-like sightings are more common in seismically active areas and that the earth releases gases which show up as nocturnal lights.  The Enumclaw area is close to Mt. Rainier which is an active volcano (currently not erupting).  Nocturnal lights have been sighted extensively on the Yakima Indian Reservation and in Hessdalen, Norway.  However, the Sweden and Yakima lights are generally not red in color.  More yellowish or white colors are common. (See references 1 and 2.) A check of astronomical data for the date and time of sighting shows that Jupiter was low on the northern horizon at the time of sighting.  However, it is unlikely that Jupiter would account for the brightness, movements, and apparent intelligence of the orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above normal low frequency electromagnetic readings in the area are interesting.  These readings were obtained well removed from power lines and other known electrical equipment.  A few scientists attribute higher readings in the areas of volcanoes.  Perhaps Mt. Rainier could be responsible for the above normal readings.  However, this is not widely accepted amongst the scientific community.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mysterious aircraft that the witness saw pursuing the orb on the night of the sighting are also unexplained.  However, the witness believes (and we agree) that the aircraft are piloted by humans and could be secret military aircraft.  The witness regularly sees these aircraft at night.  The radar data suggests that some slow moving aircraft were in the area on the night of the sighting.  However, no aircraft were seen on radar where the witness saw the orb and the aircraft.  This does not mean that the aircraft were not there.  (They could have been too low to be picked by radar or stealth aircraft.)  Radar data is difficult to interpret and sometimes will pick up cars, birds etc.  We did overlay data with streets and did not see echoes moving along well traveled roads.  This suggests that the echoes were aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We conclude that the witness has been truthful and very likely encountered the orb.  We also believe that the aircraft are unidentified, but of human origin.  The orb is unexplained.  The orb could be an unknown natural phenomenon or a vehicle of a higher intelligence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We plan to conduct further studies of the aircraft in the area.  We are planning to collect more radar data and have received several detailed follow-up reports from the witness.  We are going to make some early morning trips to Enumclaw and see if we can sight any aircraft.  We are hopeful to collect useful data in the form of videos and pictures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Reference 1:  Craig Glenday, The UFO Investigator&#39;s Handbook, Running Press, 1999 Reference 2: William R.

A coworker and myself saw the same burnt orange objects in the northeastern sky at 18:29pm est. I have saw this befor and it was the same as I first discribed it then. We first saw a single burnt orange light in the northern sky. It was there only about 20 seconds or so then went out. Then in about a minute it was visable slightly left of it first location. After about 3 min&#39;s, we saw one,then two, and then three objects in the northwest. Same shape,color,and brightness. We were shocked. I was more than he because I thought that I would never see this again. The sky was crystal clear and no moon was visable. Objects were about at 45 degree&#39;s from horizon. There were jets in the area  but at a much higher altitude. Or so they seemed. No sounds were heard.Just a regular night. I have been watching the sky since I was a small boy and I have never saw anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for same date.  PD))<n>

This was at the intersection of State Route 188 and State Route 674, going up a hill towards the small berg of Ringold. Puzzled by what the objects were, I continued driving down Rt. 188 for about four or five minutes before the objects reappeared in the middle of a cirrus cloud. This time, the objects were in the formation of a triangle, except that there was a fourth light off to the right side. Again, they only lasted for a few seconds in the sky before they dissappeared, only to return, in the same formation, minus the extra light to one side about two minutes later. This was the last time I saw them, though I continued to keep an eye towards the sky for a few minutes until I reached the city limits of Circleville. I reported the event to the local MUFON of Ohio affiliated that night (the monthly meeting of the group had been my intented destination for the evening)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see associated report from Ribolt, KY.

Before I could say anything, a second, identical, light appeared to the left and slightly up from the first. It appeared as if two planes were in extreme proximity to each other. We stopped the truck (expecting to see a plane crash) and I opened the truck door and looked right at the two lights and then saw four to six more identical lights appear in succession to the left and below the second light, almost evenly spaced and forming a semi circle as the last one or two lights appeared heading back to the right. The light positions remained static, with no change or movement, and the lights remained steady with no flickering. As I grabbed my camera, all of the lights disappeared. It all happened very quickly. The lights were much bigger and brighter than any star and we saw several airplanes as we continued our trip and none of the plane lights remotely resembled what we saw. We mentioned to many people and no one else saw it, however, a friend said she saw similar lights at her farm in the far southeastern part of this county about a month ago and she was relieved that we saw what we did. There was no sound. I&#39;ve seen a lot of strange things in the sky over the decades but this is the first one that I can&#39;t come up with a rational explanation for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from Ringold, OH, for same date, and same approximate time.

11/15/01 14:00|Monterey|CA|Oval||Cloaked UFO appears in chemtrail pictures|12/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20559.html|172|ndxe200111| Cloaked UFO appears in chemtrail pictures<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I were traveling north on Hwy. 101 somewhere between the city of Bradley and Monterey on Nov. 15, 2001.  It was somewhere between 12:00 noon and 2:00pm and the time I noticed some very interesting chemtrails.  They were in almost a sun-like pattern with a main chemtrail and others radiating out from it.  I thought I would take some pictures for my son as he is into the chemtrail phenomena.  As I was driving I asked my boyfriend if I could use his digital camera.  I started taking pictures but found it difficult to drive and do that at the same time so I handed the digital camera back to my boyfriend so he could also take some pictures.  Now, around the same time....either before or after I was also followed by a local police car.  I was never pulled over or given a ticket as I was going approximately 5-10 miles over the posted speed limit.  Other cars were going as fast or faster but the police seemed focused on me for some reason.  My boyfriend and I did NOT see any objects in the chemtrails as we were taking the pictures but later as I was sending them to my son it was my son that noticed an object in the chemtrails.  He enhanced it and sent it to me.  Sure enough, there is an oval shaped object that cannot be explained.  It looks to be lighter in color on top and darker on the bottom.  As the picture is enhanced further professionally to rule out certain normal explanations I can only compare it to other pictures of the same calibar.  Along that strip of Hwy. 101 there are some military bases that may have something to do with this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be quite serious-minded and credible.  She sent a digital photo, which shows an anomalous object in the distance, with a &#34;swarm&#34; of smaller objects surrounding it, in a rectangular-shaped cluster.  PD))<n>

I wanted to walk up into the trees to see what it was but my friend said i have no time to chase ufo undies thats my nick name. he didn&#39;t want to go up there because he wanted to go home as soon as pos! sible since it was a long walk home i didn&#39;t go and see. to cut a long story short we tried the car again and it started and got us home with no lights that was a bit freaky. but hes car trully was a heap of shit not because of ufo activities i reckon. but the car did break down before we saw any ufo enter the trees. it was a long time ago so the story is a bit hazy i have my friend on facebook but we never really talked about since then i might have to see if he remembers to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you J.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

It was very big as it was just above the tree tops, I have 6 large pine trees in my front yard, this thing was passing over very slowly. I know it was not a plane as it was far too low, and not a helecopter as it was not that type of noise. It was loud, and it passed completely over the house, going south, I then went to a southern window watched it proceed about 1/4 mile over a field to a tree line that goes into a wooded area. I then saw another light white, at the edge of the tree line also. This light was not strobing like the other was. The one that was strobing then hovered there at the tree line for about 30 minutes then it faded away. The other light however, stayed there hovering at the tree line for about another 30 minutes then it dissappeared. There are not houses around that area, as I ride my horses in the woods surrounding that area all of the time. I don&#39;t know what these crafts were as it was dark, very dark that night and I could not make out any shapes. I have never witnessed anything like this before in the six years that we have lived in this house. We have lived in this area for 10 years. I am going to go out to that area with my husband tomorrow November 25, we have a four wheeler, I am curious to see if there is any type of proof left behind.<n>

I felt &#39;memerised&#39; by this and watched it move only slightly to it&#39;s right, after about 15-20 seconds. I then found my binoculars, (which I keep in a box under the bed) at first I found it difficult to focus in on the &#39;light&#39; again! But once having &#39;focused in&#39; on the object, I noticed it was pyramid-shaped. It was flying in a circular movement &#39;like a rolling rock&#39; on it&#39;s sides. Whilst &#39;rolling&#39; through the sky, it changed colour in a sequence of four - from a pinky red, to a green, to a yellow, to a bluey turquoise colour and then back again! The object also made no sound as such and left no sign of a vapor trail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this object move quite slowly and gracefully through the sky until I lost it behind some trees! I did wonder if I were watching some form of top-secret military aircraft being tested (especially under current international circumstances!), but why would the British military risk doing this over the populated conurbation of North London? Or maybe it was a satelite. But do satelites fly in such a way? I have no other explanation.<n>

They appeared to be moving west toward the direction I was going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I at first thought it was a big commercial jet or military plane headed to the mpls. airport or the U.S.  Airforce reserve base located next to the Mpls. airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then while observing these lights I could no longer tell if they were moving or hovering. There also appeared to be a smaller craft to the north of this big craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled down my drivers side window and guessed it may have been a helicopter but no sound could be heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my attention refocused on the other craft it appeared to be hovering over a grove of trees on manning. I could easily distinguish three bright ligets on either side of a chevron or perhaps a triangular shape. I could not tell which as I believe I was looking at it dead on. I than rolled down the passenger side window and slowed downto about 20 miles per hr expecting to hear some sound. I heard nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The six bright lights completely lit up the tops of the trees. They became baseball field bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped at the corner of manning and 10th street (its a four way stop) and noticed that two guys were working on a telephone line. (a Quest truck was parked there) Looking to my right I still could see the tree line lit up. I turned left to head home to Stillwater and looked at my rear view mirrior and coule still see the tree line lit up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I checked with the Washington County police Dept to see if anyone else had reported anything, but was told no. I also called Lake Elmo Airport and no reports were taken either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m pretty neutral about the ufo thing as I&#39;m Catholic and pretty  conservative on my view of such matters.  I&#39;m not scared about this but would like hear if others have seen something like this.<n>

My wife is a nurse and I have a BA from Centre College so I believe that we are both credible.  It was a clear night sky with little or no moon which made the object stand-out even more.  The best way to describe it was triangular in shape with lights at each corner.  The reason we noticed it is that it was offset from the night sky.  It appeared to be hovering and rotating in a counter-clockwise direction.  The lights were not flashing but were steady.  I was driving and slowed down to get a better look but our view was soon obstructed.  We continued home (about 3 miles) and when we got out of the car we could still see the object.  I went inside to get a camera while my wife took our daughter inside, but by the time I found our camera and got back outside it was gone.  We can both honestly say that it was not a plane, helicopter, weather balloon, swamp gas (there are no swamps here), or anything else that belonged in the night sky.  By the process of elimination it was an unidentified flying object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

As I got off Rt 95 at Rt 97 in Boxford, I noticed a very bright orangish colored light ahead of me to the west and at a distance of a couple miles.  It appeared large and very bright.  As I drove towards it, it was also moving towards me. After driving approximately 3 mins I noticed other lights and thought maybe it was an airplane afterall.  As we continued to draw closer, it became evident it was too large to be a plane.  I then noticed a shape through the trees and it was V shaped with lights down both sides.  I pulled over with another vehicle and got out as it passed over the road.  It made no sound and was proceeding slowly and took approximately 6 or 7 seconds to pass directly over us.  I would say it was approximately 350 feet long.  It continued south past us and towards the Boston area.  I have never seen anything like it before and wasn&#39;t going to say anything until I saw a special earlier tonight and was shocked because on tv they showed a depiction exactly of what I had seen.<n>

I looked up and saw a round object at roughly 40 degrees in western sky. I kept looking up at it several times. Mostly cloudless sky. Object would have been slightly smaller than the finger nail on my smallest finger. Object appeared metalic, not like a balloon and appeared stationary. At first I thought it may have been a helicopter, but did not see any rotors or tail. I thought it would turn and I would see the rest of the shape. I had to avert my eyes to change lanes and when I looked for the object again only a few seconds later, it was gone. No clouds close enough to get behind, no other objects in the sky, to high to have dropped to the ground or float away if a balloon.<n>

I had absolutely no expectation of seeing another unusual object in the sky, and yet that is precisely what occurred this morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My account has two parts, so please bear with me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Part I: Leaving for work at 5:28 a.m., I stepped into my garage and hit the button to lift the door. (I looked at the digital clock just before I stepped out.) Moving alongside my car after the door was up, I saw the newspaper in our driveway and decided to pick it up before I left. Before I made it to the driveway, however, a very definite and very well-defined and lengthy shadow flitted across the driveway and our front lawn. There was absolutely no sound associated with the passing of this shadow. I&#39;m not the nervous type, but the shadow startled me so that I jumped into my car instead of going out to pick up the paper. I&#39;d never seen anything like this before. It was still quite dark, but a street light illuminates our entire yard to a certain extent. My first impression was that something huge had flown beneath the street light and cast the shadow. This explanation was quickly discarded due to the physical impossibility of such an event, but I was puzzled by what I saw. It appeared that our cat had been startled as well by the passing shadow because she ducked for cover under a hedge.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Part II: Seven minutes later. It is now 5:35 a.m., an hour before sunrise, and I am traveling east on Winchester Road. There is almost no traffic. The sky is mostly clear. It&#39;s 48 degrees, and the winds are calm. A few stars are visible, even though there are city lights nearby. I am going to work early to complete a project. I&#39;ve put all thoughts of the &#34;shadow&#34; behind me as I mentally prepare for the day ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The usual Fed Ex jets are flying past on their west-to-east flight paths, leaving Memphis International Airport, and I pay them little attention. However, as I passed the Nike plant on my left, I noticed a &#34;plane&#34; that seemed much lower in the sky than normal for this part of the landing and take-off pattern. It definitely caught my attention. It appeared to be hovering in place at a spot just east of the Nike plant on the north side of Winchester Road. This area is about five miles away from my home. I slowed down and came almost to a stop to get a better look at the &#34;plane.&#34; It was my perception that it was not moving at all. As I studied it, I realized that there was no strobe light on it. It also did not cast its lights ahead of it, as you would normally expect to see the lights of a jet beamed straight ahead. Instead there were three white lights aimed downward. It was then that I perceived that I was looking at a triangular-shaped craft with three bright white lights, one at each corner, and a single red light in the middle of the underside of the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was approximately the size of a fifty-cent piece held at arm&#39;s length. If I had to guess, I would estimate that it was about a quarter to a half-mile away from me, hovering in place. It exhibited no motion whatsoever, and from my perspective, seemed to be hovering over an empty field. I got quite a good look at it for a period of time I would estimate as long as two minutes.(I regret not having the presence of mind to roll down my window and listen for any sounds. I was too surprised by what I was seeing.) I continued heading slowly eastward until I lost sight of the object as I passed some trees. It was then that I resolved to make a quick U-turn and go back and get another look. I found a place about two blocks farther on to turn around, and I raced back to look at the object again. There was no trace of it whatsoever! I searched the sky for several minutes in vain. The object had quite simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw was very definitly NOT a star. It was not Venus or Jupiter. I know what the planets look like when they rise in the east. This object was in the northern sky as I faced east. The object was NOT a light on top of a cell phone tower or a utility tower. (I checked on the way home, and there are no towers of any kind in the vicinity of my sighting.) It was also very definitely NOT one of the Fed Ex jets. I had an opportunity to compare the object to the jets flying past in the background, and they were very different. This craft was lower than the jets, and the lights appeared to be of a different intensity. I have no explanation for what I saw, but I decided to give as detailed an account as possible so that others in the Memphis area can keep an eye out for such an object in the sky. It might possibly be one of our own aircraft, keeping watch over the skys in this area during this troubled time. If so, it seems to be a remarkable craft indeed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, I have no way of knowing if the shadow flitting across my lawn was related in any way to the object I spotted a few minutes later in the sky. When I got home this evening, I saw that a bright light traveling behind one of the tall trees near our driveway could have produced such a moving shadow. The light would have had to have had much greater candle power than the street light, however. I&#39;ve lived in this home for over a decade and have never witnessed such a phenomenon before.<n>

It would change colors from, a red with flashing orange, and then it would go to green with flashes around it. It made unbeliveable movemets, it would go in circles like the shape of a donut, then it would go from right to left and drop real low and then go back up. It dose not get any closer and it is not moving away. A few min later another one appeared to the far right of it, doing the same type off movements and color changes. We live way out in the country quite away from the town, and you  can not see any lights from the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting seems not inconsistent with an observation of the star, &#34;Sirius.&#34;  PD))<n>
11/13/01 18:45|Studio City|CA|Triangle|2-3 minutes|Night time triangular UFO sighted at close range flying very low and very slow over a major, busy, metropolitan area.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20167.html|185|ndxe200111| Night time triangular UFO sighted at close range flying very low and very slow over a major, busy, metropolitan area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after 18:45, my wife and I pulled onto Ventura Blvd. from Radford Ave. heading west.  There is a traffic light that you have to stop at immediately on Ventura Blvd. and I noticed what I thought at first was an airplane in the night sky to the front of me and to the right.  But then I thought it was too low and too slow to be an airplane so I pointed it out to my wife and asked her what it was.  Then I noticed that it was very low and very slow and very close, so close that there was no way that it could have been an airplane but it did not look even remotely like a helicopter.  As it got closer it slowed down to a crawl and could make out more of the lights and the shape and it and all of the lights were brilliant white, steady and not pulsating and the object was definitely triangular in shape.  The traffic light turned green and not wanting to lose sight of it, I pulled into the gas station on the corner of Ventura Blvd. and Ventura Pl. and was now looking at it through the windshield of my car as it passed over the rear of the buildings right across the street .  I had rolled down my window to see if I could hear anything and my wife rolled down her window to lean out and look at the object.  Neither of us noticed any sound coming from the object!  It had now come to a complete stop and hovered for just a few seconds and then it accelerated smoothly and turned to its left and departed in a generally north-easterly direction.  I turned right onto Ventura Pl. to keep sight of it and had to stop at a traffic light again as we watched it fly over the TV studio and out of sight.  When first noticed, it would have been near to being over the intersection of Laurel Canyon Blvd. and Ventura Pl..  When it hovered, it looked like it would have been over the buildings between Ventura Pl. and Hoffman St..  When it departed it looked like it flew over the guard shack of the nearby TV studio at Hoffman St. and Radford Ave..  Its direction of travel was almost due east until this point when it started turning! north b efore we lost sight of it over the buildings and trees of the studio.  We went to the guard shack and asked the three security guards in it if they saw the object and none of them did.  It was a cool night and they were all inside.  We noticed that while they had a terrific view of the area where the object flew, their window&#39;s reflections of the brightly lit interior made it very difficult to see outside.  When the object accelerated and turned as it departed, it never wobbled or tilted and did not bank as it turned.  It was like it &#34;skated&#34; away on a perfectly flat surface.  I would guess its speed when last observed to be about 50 mph.  There is a 12 story tall bank building at the corner of Radford Ave. and Ventura Pl. and this object was less than twice its height in altitude.  I would estimate it to have been 200 ft above ground level.  Also using the building as a reference, it think the sides of the object were about 60 ft from tip to tip.  I think the trailing edge was not perfectly straight but may have bowed out or a very shallow point.  There was a bright light near each tip of the triangle but the front tip was not quite as bright or as large as the lights the rear two lights.  There was also two panels of lights near the center that ran parallel to the center-line of the object and were side-by-side to each other.  Later we watched some airplanes taking off from the nearby Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena airport flying overhead and there was no way of confusing them with what we observed.  Our location was around Lat: 34.143, Long: -118.393 according to mapblast.com.  When we got home I checked the weather at the airport and it was was clear, 73% humidity, 49° dewpoint, 58° windchill, 30.08s barometer, N4 wind average, NW20 wind gust and 58° temperature at 20:14 hours.  I think it was in the mid 60s temperature-wise during our sighting but everything else would be close to the conditions we experienced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the Assistant State Director for one of MUFON&#39;s state organizations for many years before moving to California and my wife has investigated UFOs and had her first sighting in 1987.  We both sketched what we remember and will scan the images and email them to accompany this report.<n>

Nov 14, 2001, by a buzzing sensation throughout my whole body.  I sat up in bed and looked out the window to find a triangular shaped craft silently floating roughly 1/4 mile above my apartment complex.  The craft appeared to have a hole in the center of it, and the bottom of the craft had a series of dull red lights on the underside, with the entire group of red lights forming the triangle shape.  The craft quickly shot forward, then reversed direction to shoot backward, reversed direction again and moved forward, and finally reversed one more time and shot out of view to the south.  The craft was able to stop on a dime and change directions with absolutely no sound.  The entire sighting lasted roughly 5 seconds.<n>

After closing the back door to the car I looked up to reach to open the front driver door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was when I noticed a dull grey colored small &#34;birthday party&#34; balloon with string below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was rising at a normal helium balloon speed and appartently coming from the neighbors, 3 houses down, backyard.  After noticing the lights all off at their home and no car in the driveway I was suspicious of how it had come from that backyard that was dark and silent.  Then, without my perceptive ability to actually see the transition, it was now instantly a dull grey cigar shaped craft about 50 feet up above the houses.  It was not a balloon anymore yet retained the same color and underneath the hull of this silent and now motionless craft was a rectangular shaped protrusion of sorts that was obviously a part of the craft&#39;s geometry.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the right corner of this short protruding box-like bottom was a brilliant, almost like DIGITAL/LED square light.  The light blinked on and off with no apparent pattern and the object was the size of 3 or 4 mini-vans worth of mass in the sky from the distance I saw it.  It slowly moved horizontally over to be closer to me standing there and remained still nearly over head for a near full minute.  Then it began accelerating in a northwesterly direction at a calm speed remaining at its altitude consistently eversince ceasing to rise upward during its time as a &#34;balloon of helium&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In shock I documented the event within minutes and then before leaving after only a few minutes past the event an appartent police helicopter, &#34;ghetto bird&#34; swept low over that spot of the neighborhood doing a typical orbit around the house I was at with its spotlight on, but not pointing down at me or anything and after one full circle it flew around me there, in a diameter of about 300 yards and height near the same as the craft, the helicopter then sped off in the exact direction that what I had seen left from there traveling in.<n>

I am an advanced student of philosophy at an international educational institution. I am uncertain if my senses were decieving me or what, but waking up I saw out of my window what I thought to be a plane traveling at high altitude in a south-westerly direction. The sky was clear. Suddenly the blinking plane stopped. &#34;how could that be?&#34; I thought to myself. I then stared intently at the star-like object for several minutes. It seemed to me to continue blinking and began to shoot off what seemed to be a multitude of smaller &#34;energy bursts&#34;. I went to get my telescope, and when I returned the blinking had died down and it looked like a bright star. I find it hard to accept that my retina or some kind of tiny eye convulsions would have caused me to see such a strange spectacle. Thus I am left without a solid conclusion, other than this has never happened to me while looking at stars or planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (My impression was that it was a gov. observation/probe or some kind of demonic vessel.

Whilst watching these saddening images I noticed to the right of the scene an object darting up &amp; down and left to right, it then slowed and faded away. There was no way that it could have been an insect because it looked as if it was in the distance when you compare it with the hovering helicopters. It certainly wasn&#39;t a bird for the same reasons as above and the fact that the manouvers carried out by this object would not be possible by any bird that I know, that would also be the same for helicopters or any other craft that I know of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hopefully i&#39;m not the only person to have noticed this, unfortunately due to the nature of the images people may not have noticed this, but it certainly needs investigating.<n>

When I looked to my left a very bright blinking light caught my attention.  As I continued to stare at it I noticed it was blinking white with red lights.  I went into the house and told my brother about the star/planet, he looked out the bathroom window with me and at first thought it was a planet also.  After looking at it for a few moments, he said that&#39;s not a planet!  We grabbed my camera and a pair of binoculars and went around to the front of the house.  He looked through the binoculars while I took some pictures.  He asked me to look and see what I saw.  I described to him that I could see and object that had a bright white light in the center with red and blue/green lights on the tips and that the object appeared to be in a plate shape with a peak on the top.  Just at this time my daughter came home and we called her over to see.  Both she and her boyfriend described the same things we had seen.  I just could not believe my eyes.  I asked my daughter to go get my second floor tenant so he could also see what was in the sky.  He had the same observation as the rest of us.  Again looking through the binoculars I saw the object moving around rapidly but staying in the same area, which appears to be hovering in the same location for a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I again observed this sighting again the next night, but the object had moved northeast of my house.  My sister and her friend came over to see, they both described the same as all the others.  I went out again at 9:05pm with the dog, looking up in the dark starry sky I noticed several of these lights in different spots in the sky.  There appears to be at least 3 of these lights now hovering in the sky........I would really like to know what is going on.  I have now seen at least (4) objects within the last month.  One during the day as I travelled to work on the highway.  But I dismissed that as just an active imagination.  But now I and really concerned.  I hope there is and explaination for this....It&#39;s not easy to convince me of anything without proof, but it is hard not to believe my own eyes.<n>

Very dim lights traveling across the sky caught my peripheral vision.  There were 4 or 5 of them that seemed to come from a long object traveling very quickly from North to South at about 60 deg from horiz.  It was silent.  I could see the lights for 4 or 5 seconds then lost it in the glare from the Ford dealership lights.<n>

It was admittedly rather hazy that night, though what kind of conventional aircraft appears as a bright light periodically highlighted by flashes of red and blue and stays in one place for exceptional periods of time? My roommate gathered three of his friends to watch the show; helicopters (we think, they didn&#39;t make any sound) had begun to show up at about ten past eleven and circle around the light. Wanting to be a bit more indulged, I went down to the street (East 3rd) and ventured west to Jordan Avenue to have a closer look. I&#39;d at first thought the light was much farther northwest, but apparently it was less than a mile from our dorm and thus slightly north of the campus, directly up Jordan Ave. As soon as I made the intersection and this observation, it arced up to the west very, very quickly from a dead stop. I lost sight of it for the trees, so I kept going west along 3rd Street and made a stop on top of the Ballantine Hall parking garage. I looked around and didn&#39;t see anything, so I headed back. As I approached Jordan Ave. heading east, I saw it again, motionless over a residential area to the southeast, seemingly about the same distance it was from me before. The helicopters were gone at this time. I didn&#39;t bother going after it; the cops were prone to patrol the area for party-goers at that time of night and it was late. I thus sat out in front of my dorm and watched it do practically nothing for the next half-hour or so and went back up to my room, as there wasn&#39;t much left for intrigue. I did some work until about 3am and went out for a coffee, and was a little surprised to see that the object was still in the same place, still doing practically nothing. It was in the exact same place for the duration of the same time ! period t wo days later as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the object may have been a celestial body, but that is only a guess.

One appeared closer than the other and they were hovering over a near by mountain range.  The craft had lights positioned in a triangle formation around its perimeter.  THere was also one small light in the center of the triangle.  I was driving on the highway so I didn&#39;t get to see them for very long.  I imagine that they stayed there for longer than I was able to see them.<n>

As we got closer to it, it had three large blue lights (one in each corner).  About 30 ft from it, it suddenly raised up and made a fast u-turn.  In less than 5 seconds it was gone, quickly heading the other way.  About 3 miles from the intersection, my husband and I looked back and it seemed to be a hovering bright light at or near the airport.  The strangest thing about the whole ordeal was there was no sound at all.  (Note: There was a car about 2 car-lengths in front of us.  I am pretty sure they saw it too.  Believe me, you couldn&#39;t miss it.)<n>

The night was clear, there were starts and exactly above there was a dot of light, as bright as an average star, moving erraticaly in all directions, covering about the area that would be covered by the full moon. I looked into it for 10-15 seconds, then I went on.<n>

It is a pretty night tonight. I saw something glowing red-orange, approximately the size of a quarter in the sky right above a tree moving in a vertical upright motion. I ran in the house to tell my friends, and when they came out with me the remnants were a glowy orange sky in the direction of the quarter-sized glow that I had seen previously.<n>

At first it was behind trees but then it increased it&#39;s altitude and moved above the trees. I thought it was no more than 100 yds. away.  Another witness thought it was no closer than 1 mile.  At first it&#39;s movement was slow and steady, moving toward the west while traveling up and down.  It looked more like it was floating as apposed to flying (at first).  After a minute or two, it picked up speed moving toward the west or northwest.  At this point, I grabbed my binoculars and lost visual contact for a few seconds.  When I found it in my binoculars, it was traveling at a high rate of speed and had a flashing red light on it&#39;s &#34;tail&#34; like an airplane.  One of the witnesses confirmed that I was indeed still observing the same object.  It now moved and looked like an airplane.  I couldn&#39;t see wings or anything like that but like I said, it now had a flashing red light on it&#39;s &#34;tail.&#34;  When the red light would blink, the front portion of the object appeared to have a slight tint of yellow to it.  I noticed that I could hear a jet in the far distance but have no idea if it was coming from an actual airplane or from this object.<n>

Clouds at this time are cirrus, high and broken, when a tiny spot caught my eye.At first ,I thought it was a weather baloon(if they still use them), it was at about 35-65 thousand feet, above the clouds,aircraft are below them at cruising altitude, so it passes behind clouds, moving s.se in a zig zag type of movement. As the object gets about 70 degrees of my vertical, it seems to develope a &#34;tail&#34; as would something entering the atmosphere, except the tail is formed on the front of the object(in the direction of movement) As the &#34;tail&#34; grew, the object accelerated, s.se, out of sight behind trees blocking my view. Through binoculars the object was a perfect shiny silver- metallic looking sphere although it reflected no sunlight.The &#34;tail&#34; appendage looked simply like an afterburner on a aircraft except in scale to size it was three times as large as the sphere it&#39;sself.

The one on the left seemed to be wavering alot, veering towards the other two and behaving much more eratically. Then a fourth one came from below and shot off at hight speed to the right(North). The two lights remained at a constant distance from each other making it possible to identify the four separate objects.<n>

It did not make a sound either. The thing that freaked me out the most was that there were 3 planes i heard right after i seen the craft.

The other witness is an ER Doctor and I am a teacher.  The conditions of this event were simply perfect.  There was not a cloud in the sky and there were not lights on anywhere in the area.  It was a perfect night for just star gazing.  Both of us have been looking at the stars for years and are avid outdoors people.  We really never expected anything like this.  It&#39;s really hard to know who to tell when something so clear, real, and strange occurs. This was real.  We both saw something in the sky we had never seen before.  He (the other witness) was writing in a journal with a headlamp.  I was sitting in a chair next to him commenting on all the jets going by.  Then a white light moving in its own flight pattern caught my periphreal vision.  It was an object with a white light that was kind of like a fog light. The light seemed to go all around it.  When I first saw it I thought it was a plane.  It seemed to be coming towards me.  I knew there was no airport anywhere nearby.  I then said, &#34;What is that.&#34;  He then stopped writing in his journal, turned off his headlamp, put on his glasses, and looked up.  In that amount of time the oject with the lights had stopped moving.  When he looked up it just hovered.  It seemed to be pretty far away and we could not tell its exact shape.  One thing that was interesting though is that there seemed to be nothing in between us and it.  It was above the trees.  It stopped when we both were looking up at it.  It felt like it was looking at us too--the strangest feeling.  It must have hung in the sky for about 2 or 3 seconds.  Then it took off at an amazing speed away from us.  It kind of went away at an angle,but once it made its move away from us, it was completely out of view in about 2 seconds.  It didn&#39;t just disappear though (as if it had turned out the lights), we could see the trail of it leaving and it was getting smaller, but then it was gone on this perfectly clear night.  Thi! s whole event took about 8-10 seconds.  It was simply fascinating.  Never had either of us even thought about such an event happening.  We did not feel that we were in harm though and look forward to sitting in those same chairs another night looking for its return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Both witnesses hold jobs that require considerable formal, college education.

It was a silvery white color and seemed to reflect light. The strange thing was that it was the only thing in the sky. No other object, cloud, plane etc. were present for as far as the eye could see. It was too high to be a balloon and there wasn&#39;t any comtrail. It hung in its position for a few minutes and I thought I would get a closer look but after losing sight of it a few times due to the treeline as I drove, I realized that it was moving away from me  and obviously moving at a rapid rate because it disappeared from view in about two minutes.<n>

Law enforcement investigated and found nothing.  Local airport contacted and they stated no airplanes capable of creating a sonic boom are stationed at WV airports.  A squadron of F-16 fighters did take off from Daytons AIr Force base at 9:15am so that wasn&#39;t it.  No explanations could be found.  A witness said it felt as though it not only shook the house, but that they could feel it internally as well.  They said it wasn&#39;t like anything they have ever expereinced.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened during the northern lights show.. could they be connected?<n>

I was home, just looking out the window at the northwest section of the night sky, when a large v-shaped formation of 7 round white lights came into view, slowly moving south.  The formation seemed to be at the same altitude commercial jets use when they fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It definitely got my attention, since I didn&#39;t think any pilots (military or civilian) would be flying at night in close formation like the Blue Angels.  The v-formation appeared almost vertical, poised to gain altitude quickly.  Each of the round lights seemed larger than regular aircraft lights, looking more like spotlights instead.  Also, even though the lights were bright, I couldn&#39;t see any outline of a craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To my complete amazement, the whole v-formation appeared to come to a complete stop, and then all 7 lights started blinking and moving irraticly in and out of formation.  This went on for almost 10 seconds. Amazed by what I was seeing, I jumped up to get a better look, but just as I did so, the lights went back into v-formation and flew over my house, continuing south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly ran to look out a window on the south side of the house to see it emerge, but there was nothing there.  It seemed as if the whole v-formation just disappeared, or went straight up into space.  Very strange, very ufo.<n>

Stopped at a traffic light when object moved over us on a North - South trajectory.  The object appeared to be a ball of light, and looked as though it was less than a mile over our heads.  As it moved southward it curved toward the ground, and I instinctively looked for a sign of impact as we were on a hill and should have seen something.  We saw no impact.  The object simply curved toward the ground and disappeared.  Both observers are in professional occupations with advanced degrees.  Visibility was excellent - at least five miles from the hill on which we were stopped to hills in Fairfax County.<n>

For some reason I looked up and there it was. Flying from NE to SW against the wind. No audible noise. The shape and color were hard to tell. I couldn&#39;t tell if I was seeing 3 different triangle object fliying in a V formation,or the points of 1 larger triangle shaped craft. Also the color was strange it was silvery/translucent and seemed to reflect the color of they sky. Everything about it made it hard to tell if I was seeing a far off big object or a close small object. I watched it from about 45 degrees off my right horizon to about 60 degrees off my left horizon. Told the kids to keep an eye on it while I went in and got the camcorder. When I got back they were working on a snowman and didn&#39;t care about the UFO. I wasn&#39;t able to see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Zoomed in on the saucer you could see the small lights and 1 bright orange color light that would get brighter and bigger and then fade away into nothing but then would come back again. The saucer was coming toward my direction and once I was filming it remained in the same spot. After filming I got in my car and was traveling east. As I was moving it was moving east also. I stopped at a friend&#39;s house and she also saw the red/orange color light and the outline of the saucer. It remained in the same spot. I got back in my car approximately 10 minutes later headed back west to my home. The light was still there but in a different location and further away.<n>

At first I thought the one object was Mars and the other was another planet, however, both objects started heading North.  I could see them with the naked eye, however, were too far in the sky to see exactly what they looked like (look like 2 dots.)  They weren&#39;t airline aircraft (too high) and possibly aircraft from the local Air Force?  These 2 object were visible for approx. 4 to 6 min.  I checked them out through binoculars and thought I saw a red dot, could have been the sun&#39;s reflection.  I went out to the front, next to the driveway (at my parents home) and the 2 objects were gone.  If these were any type of aircraft and being that high, I would assume I would have been able to see the &#34;Cloud Formation&#34; from the engines of such an aircraft.  These 2 objects moved slow without have the &#34;Cloud Formation&#34; then disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my 2 sighting of such aircraft/UFO in 2 days, within 12 hrs apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Glendale, AZ 8:30 AM<n>

I saw something move out of the corner of my eye up in the sky to my right (north). I looked and at first thought it was a large bird. But I watched it and realized it was definitely not a bird. My guess (very hard to estimate something you see briefly in the dark) was that it was a metallic (dark metal...like stealth material) triangular object maybe the size of a helicopter or small plane. It glided quickly and silently (no noise AT ALL) about 500 feet (??) above the buildings in a south direction. I could see the bottom of it enough to make out something like landing gear or lights or something on the bottom, but it was dark. There were no lights at all. The only reason I saw it at all was because I happened to be looking at the sky in the middle of a city and well-lit apartment complex by a major street. I could make out the shape and bottom of the object because of the city lights just bright enough to allow me to see something...although just barely. I could easily have missed a dark object floating across a dark cloudy sky! I only saw it for maybe 10-15 seconds, as it was quickly out of my view and across the street.<n>

Its about 9:43pm right now and I just witnessed the best thing ever.  At approximately 9:25pm, this evening, I saw, what appeared to me as a UFO.  I have never seen one before only read about them on different sites.  However, the object I saw was lower than most aircraft in the area and was shooting across the sky at a very rapid rate, much faster than the aircraft here.  The object was round, the bottom looked like a reddish gold color, no lights and no sound.  I ran downstairs, from my apartment, went to the parking lot, not 3 to 4 seconds later and the object was gone.  I&#39;ve had many mixed feelings until now.  Now I have become a believer.  I thought you would like to know my story, I&#39;m very excited about the entire event and wanted to share this extraordinary night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> GLendale, AZ<n>

When I looked up I saw two faint dots of light movind from east to west. When my eyes adjusted you could see the two points of light were attached to the tips of a dark oval shaped object. I watched the object move from about ten o&#39;clock to two o&#39;clock in the sky, then lost it in the light of my light pole. I went inside to call a friend that lives close by and went back outside. While outside I was facing south, with the moon over my left shoulder. I was telling my friend about the first one when a three pairs of lights forming a triangle on angle came over my left shoulder and moved to the south east. With the light pole behind me I watched this one disappear about thirty degrees over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only reason you could see the bodies of the objects is that they were darker than the surrounding sky. After seeing this I spoke exitedly to my friend, we both observed three aircraft in the western sky. The southern most turned out to be a plane, the other two hung in the sky to the west. You could see the colors of normal aircraft lights. My friend said he could hear the blades of the helicopter.<n>

DUE TO THE PITCH-BLACK DARKNESS AT SOME DATE IN THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER, I WALKED ACCIDENTALLY OFF THE PUBLIC FOOTPATH WHICH LEADS TO THE LARGE STONE DOMINION PARK MUSEUM, BUILT INTO THE GROUNDS OF THE PARK&#39;S CENTRE DUE TO COMPLETE NIGHT BLINDNESS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AFTER WALKING FOR AROUND 5 MINUTES, MY EYES ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO THE NIGHT-SKY OVERHEAD AND I BECAME AWARE MARGINALLY I WAS STANDING IN THE GRASS CLEARING, SURROUNDED BY THE TALL TREES THAT SURROUND THE PARK, IN A SIMILAR WAY TO CENTRAL PARK, NEW YORK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AFTER SUDDENLY BEING ALMOST SURPRISED BY THE ALIGNMENTS OF THE STARS IN THE NIGHT-SKY OVER AUCKLAND, I NOTICED ONE PARTICULAR BRIGHT STAR MOVING IN A WESTERNLY DIRECTION SLIGHTLY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AT FIRST, I HAD THOUGHT IT WAS MERELY A SATELLITE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ALTHOUGH, DUE TO THE ALMOST STRAIGHT LINE ORBITING OF SATELITES, THE SLIGHT SHARP ANGLES THAT THE STAR MOVED, ALWAYS IN MOTION EITHER SLOWLY OR SLIGHTLY INCREASING IN ACCELERATION CAUSED ME TO REALISE THAT OVER SECONDS, IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A SATELLITE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> DUE ALSO TO THE ALMOST EXACT SIZE, BRIGHTNESS AND APPEARANCE, I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE THE SIGHTING AS BEING A UFO DUE TO THE LACK OF SOUND, THE ALMOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE RIGHT ANGLES AND SHARP DIRECTIONAL PATH THAT THIS STAR MOVED. VISUALLY, ONLY COMPARABLE TO A POOL-BALL ONCE AFTER BEING STRUCK HARD TO ONE SIDE WITH A POOL CUE SHOT, THEN REBOUNDING OFF EACH CUSHION ON A POOL-TABLE. ALSO A COMPLETE LACK OF FLASHING-LIGHTS, BLINKING-LIGHTS WHICH WOULD HAVE EASILY CAUSED THE SIGHTING TO BE AN AIRCRAFT OF SOME KIND..<n> <n><n> <n><n> YET, REALISTICALLY I AM UNAWARE OF ANY CRAFT THAT CAN PERFORM DIRECTIONAL RIGHT-ANGLE TURNS AT SUCH IMMENSE SPEED. AT THE AGE OF 37 I HAD NEVER KNOWN OF ANY AIRCRAFT, ROCKET, SHUTTLE, ANYTHING THAT CAN PERFORM SUCH DYNAMIC DISPLAYS AS THAT WHICH I WITNESSED WITHIN THAT STILL ETERNAL MOMENT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I HAVE SINCE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO LEARN OF ANYTHING DESIGNED ON EARTH THAT CAN TURN A DIRECT 90 DEGREE TURN OBVIOUSLY WHILE OUTSIDE OF THE EARTH&#39;S ATMOSPHERE, THEN A LESSER DEGREE ANGLE AND CONTINUE TO DO SO OVER SECONDS. IT WAS A DISPLAY OF SUCH INCREDIBLE WONDER, THAT I JUST LAUGHED. WHATEVER THE BRIGHT STAR HAD BEEN, I SIMPLY HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING MOVE AT SUCH A SPEED AND SO DIRECTLY, WITHOUT A SINGLE ERROR.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WITHIN 30 SECONDS, THE STAR MOVED AT SUCH A SPEED. IMMEDIATELY IT THEN DISAPPEARED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> YET IT WAS WITNESSED AS A SIGHTING ACROSS PARTS OF NEW ZEALAND BY AT LEAST 30 PHONE CALLS TO THE POLICE IN THE SOUTH ISLAND.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  This witness telephoned from Europe, and then submitted a follow-up report.  He sounded to us to be quite credible.  He apparently has had several sightings, and will submit other reports from other dates.  PD))<n>

There were 2 ufo&#39;s in formation heading North /West. We counted at least 9 sets of lights. All ufo&#39;s had blue and red flickering lights ( These lights were flashing to quickly to be plane navigation lights). They were moving at extremely fast speeds.  We stopped to watch 2 ufo&#39;s flying in formation while the others went in different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness means a date of November 03, 2001, as indicated in the Event Date box.

As i focused in on the yellow light i could see what looked like two seprate lights, then i was able to see some kind of image, it was dark in color, when we viewed the tape it looked as though it was a large object, could not tell what the shape was, but we counted 3 other lights on this &#34; object &#34; the two lights look like they could be 2 windows with the bright light shining through.. i went outside to get more footage of this object, but the light turned into a ball, or round object, it looked like it had  wire wrapped around it, i could see the image i had seen earlier, i know this was the same object i taped a few minutes before, becuase it was in the same area, it just moved up higher in the sky..<n> <n><n> <n><n> we also viewed 6 triangle formations in differnt parts of the sky,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses were looking at a star, but that is a guess.

The only thing was that it was clearly moving at a constant rate, it had a specific direction (East north east)and had an orange glow that was not from ambient light.  I can only describe its shape as akin to a baby pacifier.  It moved quickly, but with a simaltaneous rocking motion, that seemed very measured and constant.  It moved so quickly, about the distance of three quarters of a mile, at about a minute&#39;s passing.  I might add that even though i&#39;m in Chicago, it was a particularly still day today.  Very strange, for some reason, seems noteworthy<n>

Appeared directly overhead and appeared to travel approx. 15 degrees before disappearing.  Appeared to be approx. same diameter as Jupiter at zenith, but was intensely white and bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was circular in shape, very well defined, moving at an extremely high rate of speed.  What made this observation unusual was the absolute lack of smearing as it progressed (being a longtime viewer/photographer of meteor showers I&#39;m well aware of normal characteristics) and the abrupt disappearence of the object. Both my wife and I viewed this object and we concur in our descriptions of what we observed.  We are avid viewers of the night sky and absolute skeptics.  The lack of smearing and the excellent definition of the object are why we are submitting this report. Hypothesis non fingo.<n>

Only one group of small clouds in the sky (Just went outside to check). Sitting in my room with the curtains open watching TV. Saw it as soon as it passed into view over rooftop within frame of window. Saw 1 single bright orange object very low in the sky. Glowing bright orange, looked as though it was gliding. Orange glow faded to bright blue then faded completely away (vanished) well before reaching the next &#39;out of sight&#39; boundary witch was the neighbors rooftop. Traveled in a perfectly straight line towards the N.E. It flew below the cloud layer at one point during its flight path. Looked lower in the sky than commercial aircraft. Seemed larger than a single prop airplane like a Cessna (difficult to judge its distance by other aircraft that were in the area). Faster than an airplane, slower than a meteorite. It left no tail, streak, or visible wake of any kind. Extremely graceful and smooth. Was wearing glasses at the time of the sighting. The object definitely had a silhouette and shape but was moving to fast to make out its exact shape. Sighting lasted approximately 2 and a half to 3 seconds.  After it faded out there were no visible objects in its flight path. As if it had simply vanished. I opened my window immediately after words to listen for sound, there was no sound at all not even from insects.  10 to 20 seconds later normal aircraft were spotted within view of my window and those appeared much higher in the sky and also had the normal aircraft sounds that would be associated with them. It does defy all my current knowledge and experience of weather, meteorites, and aircraft. I require more information about what I&#39;ve just witnessed before I could tell myself for sure what it was. I wrote as much of this down as possible right after the event happened. I would have called this in over the phone, but at this moment there is no phone number available for me to call it in with.

The light was lower than an airplane would normally fly, and then the light shot horizontally away from us at a very high rate of speed heading East leaving a trail of light and disappeared.  When the light shot across the sky it resembled a cruise missle you would see on TV in Afghanistan, although at a much faster rate of speed.  My daughter and I both gasped at the sight, and then realized we had both seen an extraordinary sight.<n>

My friend asked everyone if we just saw the same thing and we all agreed, we headed back into town and we spoke of it to a few people and nobody had a clue what we where on about but we dont really get fazed with things flying in the sky cause everyone knows there is something out there, its just a great privlage i suppose to see such things and kinda exilerating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And with the Characteristics of the Object.... I cant really put it into easier terms but it was like the light was created then the objects flew threw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

There was a low cloud cover, and the sun was not visible in the sky. I noticed a long, black object traveling at high speed beneath the clouds. It appeared on my left, to the north, and moved in a southerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For a split-second, I thought I might be watching a flock of geese flying over, as we have many geese in the area. However, the object was traveling far faster than any flock of geese could fly. There appeared to be a black &#34;smudge&#34; behind the object. I at first thought this might be a black vapor trail, but the &#34;smudge&#34; didn&#39;t linger in the sky. The &#34;smudge&#34; seemed to move in tandem with the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object first appeared as a black line then changed to an acute triangular shape. It struck me as odd that the edges of the object appeared to be blurred and somewhat indistinct. Nevertheless, the most striking feature of the object was the speed with which it traveled across the sky. I cannot begin to estimate its speed, but it was out of sight within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a professional with two college degrees. I&#39;ve lived near the flight paths of Memphis International Airport for the past sixteen years and enjoy &#34;sky watching&#34; during the day and at night. I&#39;ve never seen anything to compare with what I saw this morning. I&#39;m hoping someone else may have seen the object too and will report it to your web site.<n>

I want to say October but after reading some of the reports on this site it sounds consistent with November reports. I was driving away from my friends house in Tallahassee Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was out by the Kruger Center near the golf course. I was an employee at the Tallahasee airport recently towards this time so I knew what aircraft came and went at that time. It was between 11pm and 1230 or so. The only aircraft that would have came in was a Delta flight which lands at 11:10pm. However it was past that time and way to low for that. My friend was driving in front of me and we saw this triangluar object above us. It was very huge. Probably about the size of a football field and maybe a football field in a half. It was traingluar but wide. It had lights on the side that were yellow and some where white. It looked like it was headed towards the airport but it was way to low. Maybe about a mile to a mile 1/2 off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had seen planes come in from that area before and they were never that low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was also extremly quiet. no noise. it disappers it about 30 secs to a min.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew alot about the airport and it was definatley not a airplane.<n>

I left the car to idle, I walked about 8 steps and I saw the lights get closer still thinking it was an airplane (mind you I lived just out the gates of NAS pensacola for 3 years, I watched many night flights of many planes including a stealth in hover, so I feel that I can not be fooled by this.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came just a block away from where I was standing,  It became huge it looked like the shape of the sun from a distance it was completely round, and was extremely bright like the sun with a white glow, then it made a swift turn, one side to the other like opening up.  You could still see the size, I saw the center up and down was black and it still glowed on the right and left side.  It then began to drop stuff from the bottom (although there  was a black space between the circle and the stuff coming out, glowing like gold particules.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so intent on seeing the stuff falling, and the fact that it was right above the Fairfield school district concerned me.  What was it dropping?  I thought, then in a matter of seconds it stopped dropping the stuff, I looked up a little, and it was GONE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to my car in what seemd like 3 to 5 mins. and the heater in the car was working great it worked for 2 more days and stopped. After this I litterally sat on my roof looking for these things, and from a distance I did see them again twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

The dumpster is in a well-lit parking lot.  We lived in a building complex consisting of several houses in the middle of nowhere nestled alongside a large mountain-chain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I&#39;m returning back to my house, I catch a glimpse of a light to my right out of the corner of my eye.  I turn and I see a large triangular craft hover slowly overhead.  It was clearly visible in the flood-lights in the parking lot, though no detail could be seen through the snow.  It was no more than 20 feet above the tree line, and moved no more than 15MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After it passed overhead and started to head off into the darkness, I was able to gauge its height above the tree line.  I was also able to see a slight profile of the craft.  It seemed to be triangular in shape - more like a stretched out pyramid.  It could have been boomerang shape, I&#39;m not entirely sure because of the snow, but I was able to see blue-white lights on its edges/corners shaped in a triangle fashion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft made no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One thing I noticed is that my ears popped during the encounter.  That could have just been a coincidence as it is common at that elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My opinion is that the snow storm was too bad for any known aircraft to be flying that low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this incident, I seem to be experiencing a phenomenon called &#34;street-light interference&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It kinda looked like maybe a triangle, but I couldn&#39;t really tell. It was huge, I would guess maybe a hundred feet or more, depending on how high up it was. It moved really slowly over the tree tops and slowed down as it came over the Ohio River. It looked like it was just looking at the water then it came towards our house. It speeded up and dissapeared over the hill to the back of our house. I&#39;m not really sure of the exact details, but it seemed to have a sphere on the bottom, but like I said it was just a distortion. The reason I think it had a sphere on the bottom(semi-sphere) is the way the stars moved. They got longer and longer, and then seemed to get really close at the middle of the distortion. This is my second Ufo sighting, but I really don&#39;t know what it was. It could have been some strange gas that can stop and move again or a military aircraft that can go invisible. The reason I don&#39;t know if it is or not is because I never heard of anything like this before, but if it was a Ufo, it&#39;s a strange one. And something else that was weird, all of our watches stopped at the same time, and was a minute behind all of the ones in the house.<n>

A few minutes later the room started vibrating slightly, and I assumed my mom was doing the laundry.  It was late at night, so I discounted that, and became curious as to what it was (and somewhat anxious).<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few seconds later the room illuminated bright turquoise blue.  My area has many upgraded cars/luxury cars with Xenon lights, so I assumed someone was in the driveway with lights pointed towards my room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I opened up my shade to invesitage, and I saw nothing.  I was very confused, but still curious.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw a cigar shaped object (I just got the chills while writing this) that looked like it had windows on it, maybe 6 to 10, and had red lights on the bottom and top.  It was about fifteen feet away from my window, and was going by very slowly (I am getting the chills again?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately I got an extreme relaxation, best described as euphoria.  It felt fine, but weird.  I didn&#39;t believe my eyes, but knew I saw it- it was literally out of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up and told my parents and they said I must have been dreaming, but this was not the case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 16 at the time, I was/am I very bright individual, do not do drugs, and am on no medication that could be responsible for what I saw/felt.

He said he summited another sighting him and his brother had last year, and he said it would be helpful if his brother would email you. He asked me to email you to tell you my verson of it.

I am a am a nightly sky watcher and I suddenly noticed this new star which caught my eye due to the bright magnitude. It&#39;s brighter than any nearby stars in that part of the sky.  It is white and something about it just looks different, it appears to me to be slightly flashing but totally white.  When I look through the binoculars, I am definitely seeing 3 colors flashing: green, red and amber.  It rises like a star throughout the evening as if it&#39;s moving with the earths rotation.  I look through the binoculars at other objects that I know to be stars to see if maybe I am getting the colors through some kind of distortion but the other stars are all white.  One evening, there was 2 of the objects about the same height in the sky and about 30 degrees between them. Also, always in conjunction with this star rising, I see lots of little white flashes flickering here and there in the vicinity of the star.  One night, there were 8 flashes that all went off pretty much simultaneously, like flashbulbs popping but not with that amount of brightness,  and it was almost like they were communicating.  One other interesting point, I looked up in my star maps and there is no star of that magnitude located underneath Casseopia.  I know stars twinkle but they don&#39;t change colors.  I don&#39;t know what to make of this and think that I can&#39;t be the only person seeing this.  Hopefully, someone else will write in and confirm my sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Object may be the star, &#34;Sirius.&#34;  PD))<n>

It was late at night  while we were on our way > to a gig, driving along the New York State|1/29/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21392.html|278|ndxe200111| The first experience was in the mid 1970s. It was late at night  while we were on our way &gt; to a gig, driving along the New York State thruway, near Herkimer, NY. I &gt; was riding in the passenger seat and happened to look out across the &gt; valley. It was a perfectly clear night with an almost full moon and some &gt; high, very thin clouds, and the details of everything are still sharp in &gt; my mind. As I looked up above the distant ridge, I saw a green, &gt; spherical light moving along parallel to our direction of travel. It &gt; moved along steadily, and I assumed it was a beacon light on a plane. I &gt; joked to the person driving, &#34;Hey a UFO!&#34;, and as I watched the green &gt; light moved in front of one of the wispy clouds, at which point I could &gt; see that it was ONLY a spherical green light. I began watching intently, &gt; getting a chill, and shortly it stopped abruptly and shot up straight &gt; through the wispy clouds at an incredible speed. Gone! At this point, &gt; our keyboard player who was a sound sleeper jumped up out of a dead &gt; sleep in the back seat and yelled &#34;What&#39;s wrong!&#34; Very strange, and it &gt; gets stranger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;     Within the next couple of years, I was still in the band, and was &gt; home here in Warner for a visit with my mother. I was in this very room, &gt; at the time a bedroom, now my office. I am a very sound sleeper, and was &gt; sound asleep (it was the middle of the night, another clear moonlit &gt; night). I woke up, wide awake, suddenly, and looked out the window over &gt; our yard, which is clear lawn about 100 yards to a treeline at the end &gt; of the yard. The green spherical object was sitting there out over the &gt; tops of the trees at the end of the yard, and it began to move, &gt; noislessy, toward the house (at least it appeared to, because it was &gt; getting larger). It reached about halfway across the yard, at treetop &gt; level, stopped abruptly, and shot straight up, again at an incredible &gt; speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &gt;     That was it for about the next twenty odd years. Not a thing. I&#39;ve &gt; told ((name deleted)) (my wife) about it, and she wondered about it, but this next one is &gt; great. About three or four months ago, I was lying in bed, next to &gt; Deborah, when I woke up like a shot. Right up next to our front window &gt; at the top of the sash, but outside the window, was the green sphere. It &gt; was blinking on and off at a relatively slow rate. Deb woke up like a &gt; shot, and got a look at it as well. We both decided it was the size of a &gt; basketball, and it quickly shot out of sight, upwards, after about five &gt; or six seconds of flashing.<n>
11/1/01 01:00|Truman Lake area|MO||5 minutes|As this object approached, my dog became much more menacing in his deep-throated growl, and his eyes locked onto this object and starte|10/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46607.html|279|ndxe200111| I was out camping in the country in Benton County, MO in the Truman Resevoir area. I was lying outdoors, snuggled in my sleeping bag in November, 2001, at about 1 am. It was a full-moon that night; ceiling and visibility were unlimited. I was encamped in a sparse cedar grove at the Southern end of a 40-60 acre cattle pasture. Wind was almost still; ambient noise was basically non-existent; air temp was approx. 40F. What breeze there was from the NW&lt;5 mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I awoke to my wolf-dog hybrid(1/4 wolf;1/4 malamute; 1/2 yellow lab; I include this description of him to give a sense of how much I trust this dog&#39;s senses and instincts; he is very intelligent, very observant, and knows the difference between a possible threat or unknown machine or entity and something to be disregarded) growling--not viciously or menacingly--at first, just suspiciously, and observing something off the ground over the pasture. At first, very faintly, I hear a &#34;swooshing&#34; noise with a high pitched whine approaching from the North very slowly. Also, the swooshing noise was deep and rythmically slow. The best thing I could come close to describing it as sounding like is an attic fan with a whining, loose bearing. As it approached, the noise became more pronounced, but the same rythmically. This was a full moon night; this thing was within 200 yards of me over open terrain. I would judge its alltitude at between 100 and 200 feet. Its airspeed was much, much slower than any man-made aircraft I know of could maintain and stay aloft. I was in the military; I have flown in Blawkhawks, Hueys, Sea Nights, and C-135&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this object approached, my dog became much more menacing in his deep-throated growl, and his eyes locked onto this object and started tracking it.  Yet, I could see nothing.  This object flew directly over me; my vision was unobstructed.  The moon was overhead slightly to the South West. The object flew over me at about 100-200 feet.  Airspeed was &lt;60mph. It was a slow &#34;wooshing&#34; sound, and the whine was so high pitched as to become almost auditorily painful and inaudible at the same time. It agitated my brain and nervous system to a point almost unbearable as it passed over. Again, the closest I could come to describing the effect is to compare it to the EMF field surrounding a powerful electric sub-station. My dog tracked this thing with a deep-throated rumbling growl and an intense, unabated stare all the way over us and across the horizion until it was inaudible; ie: He could see it, I could not! Its vector was from 11:00 NW to 5:00 SE. There was no visual obstruction overhead in the starfield; no obstruction of the moonlight; no visual distortion of any kind overhead against the starfield, the moon, nor either horizion from its approach to its departure. The diameter of the &#34;wooshing&#34; sound as it passed directly over me I would estimate to have been 40-60 feet??? There was no air displacement. The wooshing sound was moderately loud, but nothing to the point of roaring or uncomfortable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> INVESTIGATOR FOLLOW UP: In reference to your questions, I will try to answer them in order. The only other bodily sensations I  had consisted of the &#34;tingling and icy cold-blooded feeling&#34; one gets when confronted by something they have never experienced before; and cannot identify--in other words: &#34;fear&#34;! (also, hair standing on end, ect.) As for how I felt after it left? Physically fine; no lasting hearing impairment or pain. Now psychologically, I was very agitated and anxious; it was very fascinating, exciting, and frightening all at the same time!  And no, no missing time. Sorry! lol. Again, no; no dreams--just fascinating and life-long memories. And yes, I have been back there since the incident--and many times before--and only this one time has anything unusual occurred. As for it being worth further investigation, I sincerely doubt it. Again, I have camped there many times since 1986, and have had only this one experience. However, I spent allot of time out West in California, Wyoming, and Colorado. I was in the Marines in California from 1988-1993 in the infantry. I am an avid backpacker, hiker, camper, and general all-around outdoor-nature nut! I have spent allot of time in far more remote regions than this; and this was my first and only experience(and my grandmother&#39;s &#34;sighting&#34; was in the same county back in 1987). So, who knows for sure?  As for an electrical transformer sound? No, not really; it was a whining noise: very high-pitched, rythmical, and...&#34;mechanical?&#34; Not a humming or buzzing type noise. But without a visual/phyisical description, I&#39;m not sure of what value it would be; other than its uniqueness of being only heard and not seen, I guess! lol.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (Report received by Missouri Investigators Group. http://ufomig.bravehost.com.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFOMIG@yahoo.com)<n>
