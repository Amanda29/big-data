7/31/97 02:45|Salem|OR|Unknown|unknown|Missing Time July 31, 1997|8/5/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/070/S70824.html|1|ndxe199707| Missing Time July 31, 1997<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happened on July 31, 1997  I had seen something a few days earlier when I was in the backyard and called mom and told her about it, sometime the next morning several others saw the same UFO I did but they made a official report and were talking about it on Art Bell and it made the papers.. I had seen the UFO heading south toward California and it was seen by the others over Medford near the California border, later that same morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this sighting when I heard others talking about it on the radio and read about it in the paper, I decided to call Peter Davenport,at the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Peter had been up most all night taking reports with all the sightings in Medford and was very tired and did not have time to take the report, or at least this is what I believe that he said.  I took it personally and thought I would never call Peter again (not Peters’ fault, just my own judgment of the situation. I was helping out a friend in a small store here and told her about it and was still smarting at how Peter had treated me, or I thought he had treated me, and told her about that too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway I was home watching TV, my husband was about to go to bed, he is needs lots of sleep.. he reminded me to lock the back door and put the stick in it.. that way if the cats get ancy we can open the patio door, put a stick in it and let them go in and out at will... anyway I said I would, and did, and he went to bed and I lay down on the couch and was out like a light, fully dressed/shoes too The next thing I remember was waking up and seeing it was time to feed the cats, it was about 7AM.. my husband was in his computer room and the back door was open, the stick had been removed, I got up, fed cats and my husband and was relaxing watching TV news with my second cup of coffee, when the phone rang and it was &lt;former boss&gt;, she was calling me to see if I was alright, and to ask me about the lights, I said you mean the ones I saw the other night? She said NO the ones you saw this morning.. I said I did not see any lights this morning and she said Yes you did, she again said are you OK?   I said YES I was fine, why wouldn&#39;t I be.. she said after your call this morning about the lights, I said what call, she said the one you made to me early this morning, she said you left me a message.. I wanted to hear it but she had erased it not thinking about it, but had listened to the message numerous times and had written it down verbatim&#39; and signed the paper.. this is what she said the message said... (my remarks)  &lt;name&gt;, this is CK, I&#39;m really sorry to call you at this time, it is 2:40 AM, in the morning, I am out by North Salem High School ( this is about 3 miles from my home) and I have been watching a bright light in the sky for about 45 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you know Peter Davenports number or one who does that sort of thing down here (In Salem) they need to be called. I am looking south and a little east and the large light is very bright, too big to be a star. There are 3 smaller lights in a line down one side and I can see two in a line down the other side, but there may be a third one, I can&#39;t see from here. It hasn&#39;t moved. If you know who investigates these please call them and tell them the information because there is no way this is stars..<n> <n><n> <n><n> End of recording/message..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told &lt;name&gt; that she was kidding, right? she said &#34;No I swear its true&#34;  I asked her where I called from, she said she did not know, but that when I was done I did not say goodbye or anything, the line just went totally blank/dead, and it had a empty tinny sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my husband into the living room and asked him when he took the stick out of the patio door? He said I thought you did, the door was open when I got up about 6:00 AM.. I ran to the front door, and it was closed but unlocked, it had been locked and a separate latch used, that was also open.. then I went into the driveway, scared of what I would find, and there was my car, parked on the opposite side of the driveway than I usually park.. I was terrified.. Where had I been, what had I done?  I asked my husband did you get up to go to the bathroom last night? He is usually up 2-3 times a night, NO he said for some reason he had not awakened till just before he got up..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my purse and drove over to the high school, I got out of the car near the football field and walked over to the fence surrounding the field, trying to remember what I might have seen, did anything trigger a memory, and all that happened was that I got very dizzy, but walked around looking for some clue as to what had happened.. I remember looking for a tan shingled roof I had been standing near and wanted to check that out on the letter from &lt;name&gt;and was very surprised to see she/I had not mentioned any such roof or color of shingles in the message so it must have been a memory of the event..the only one I have had of that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am fortunate to know a lot of UFO researchers and I immediately called my old friend Dr Leo Sprinkle who works with abductees, some researchers or psychologists make the event scary, but if Dr Sprinkle does the same interview the abduction becomes a positive experience not a negative one, a learning experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was terrified about what could have happened... what if I would have had a car accident? a flat tire? How would I explain being out driving alone at 2:40 AM?   Dr Sprinkle pointed out that I was likely totally alert and in control till I got home and that is when they took remove any  memory of what happened..<n> <n><n> <n><n> This still haunts me and I still check the doors several times during the evening hours to be sure they are locked. For over a year I had slept fully dressed in a sweat suit complete with shoes etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: Peter is always open and willing to listen to urgent reports. I just took his being tired personally and that was my problem, not Peters’ short coming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CK 7/31/97<n>

7/30/97 23:40|Bognor Regis (UK/England)||Circle|30mins|3 Blurred Circles.|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28082.html|3|ndxe199707| 3 Blurred Circles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I were driving from a birthday party (only one of us had been drinking, and that person had only one Lager) in Bognor Regis. As we came up one of the main roads towards the motorway, I looked up into the sky and saw what looked like a blurred circle that seemed to be stationary. To avoid the traffic of the motorway, the driver decided to take the backroads, as we turned on to one of the backroads the blurred circle dissapeared from my view, I thought nothing of it. Around 10 minutes later I looked up at the sky again and saw not one blurred circle but now 2, they seemed to almost be &#39;dancing&#39; in the night sky. A couple of minutes later another blurred circle seemed to appear out of no where. Thinking that I was seeing things I called to the passanger in the front passanger seat (which is on the left side for the UK. I was seated in the left rear passanger seat) and told them to look out of their window. They looked out and they too saw the 3 circles moving in an almost figure 8 pattern in the night sky (all in a line, like follow the leader). We sat and watched them for a couple more minutes, then we told the other passanger and the driver. The other passanger leaned across and saw the circles as well. We drove on for a few more minutes (it was now about 24:00), and the curiosity of the driver caused them to slow the car and stop, they then got out and watched the blurred circles. We sat there watching them (except the driver, who was standing outside the car) for about another 10 minutes, then 1 of the 3 blurred circles (the one that was leading the figure 8 &#39;dance&#39;) dropped a smaller object that seemed to be &#39;sharper&#39; and brighter than the blurred circles (its shape was hard to tell from our distance, but I would say it looked cylinderical). Then suddenly out of no where a much larger blurred circle appeared, the 3 smaller blurred circles then appeared to &#39;enter&#39; the larger one, the larger blurred circle then dissapeared again. The driver got back in the car and we drove on towards our ! destinat ion without any more sightings of the UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driver: Former Royal Lifeguard, medically discharged (one of the original soldiers to test depleted uranium munitions. Lead to asthma, and cancer). Worked as a mechnanic during the time of the sighting. Had not been drinking on the night it happened. Was aged 36 at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Front Passanger: Was working as a part-time cleaner at the time. Was aged 34 at the time of the sighting. Had been drinking on the night it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Left Side Rear Passanger (me): Was aged 11 at the time. Obviously had not been drinking on the night it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right Side Rear Passanger: Was aged 13 at the time.

Very quick.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was up watching a meteor shower. I had only seen one or two and I was about to go to bed, when I saw a very large fireball fly very quickly directly over my house. It seemed to be very close to the ground. It traveled quickly behind a building and I lost track of it. Object was orange with what seemed to be a faint tail. It seemed to be either very large or very close to the ground, maybe both. I observed it for a maximum of four seconds. This was unlike anything I had ever seen before, and I know it wasn&#39;t a meteor. I was a little shook up afterwards. Hope this information is useful. Thank you.<n>

We lived on 16th street near where 16th st. intersected Morgan Street and about half a mile from Cole Park on the bay. One day my friend&#39;s cousin had visited him during the afternoon and was going to stay the night. So we decided to spend the rest of the day hanging out and when nightfall approached. We decided to show him our late night hang out spot which was an abandoned house next to my friend&#39;s house. The abandoned house had a 2nd story patio that could be reached by stairs and from there we could easily jump on the roof. We would hang out on the rooftop there late at night since we did not have school and it was okay with our parents. We would look up at the stars and talk about anything. We&#39;ll that night around 1:00am, we decided to go to our hang out spot on the abandoned house rooftop. The rooftop was in the shape of an L and it was not flat but slanted on each side. I was sitting down on the long side of the L shaped roof facing to the North . While my friend and his cousin sat on the short side of the L shaped roof facing West. We were there for about an hour talking about something when all of a sudden I noticed something stranged. As I was looking at my friends I noticed a bright white light appear around us. I was shocked since it was 1:00am and there was no moon visible in the night sky. As I looked up to see the source of this light. I saw a white bright glowing object hovering about 15ft in the air near the end of the of the L shaped roof near my friends and about the size of a small car. This object did not have propellers, wings, or any insignia that may have confirmed it was a commercial or military craft. All of sudden it ceased its hovering position and began to move toward us. Afraid and shocked at what I was seeing I immediatly got up and made a mad dash to the patio and my friends followed suit. As we made our frantic run from the object I looked back at the ob! ject onc e I reached the ground but it was gone. As we reached my friend&#39;s house. We were all shivering from fear and we could not come to a conclusion to what we saw. Since then we have kept the incident to ourselves for about 9 years.  A while back I visited my friend, since we have all moved from our original neighborhood, to finally bring this incident to light for us. He was relunctant and wants to forget the incident but from his viewpoint he agreed to settle the matter. He remembers seeing a scared reaction on my face and when he looked to see what was the matter. He said the object was approaching and instantly he and his cousin ran as fast as they could. While on the patio he turned to see the object. He said he saw the object zig zagging back and forth into the sky then disappearing leaving a metallic streak. A while back I saw the documentary about UFO phenomena with Peter Jennings on the National Geographic Channel and heard about the UFO Center. I felt I should tell the center of my experience and maybe someone else around that area may have reported the same object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

At first it was a small orange body giving me the impresion that I was looking at another meteor but the object just got larger and brighter, after seeing the object grow in size and brightness it continued to travel across the sky with a slight wobble in it path (like viewing a object through hot air). This wobble lasted for about 30 seconds then it continued to travel in a stright line. Its speed also slowed down as it crossed the sky. As it passed overhead the bright orange glow started to disapate. This allowed me to make out a flashing light on the upper surface of the craft the light flashed about every second. The craft passed overhead at about 10,000 feet. As the craft disapiered into the trees behind the campsite I heared the slight roaring sound of jet engines. Flight path was from the south east to the north west. No sonic booms. are we test aircraft that can fly after entering atmospher?<n>

Daniel said it was just an airplane or helicopter. So we went to play. It was 20 minutes after when I remembered it and looked up, it was still there. It didn’t move like an airplane and then we figured it wasn’t an airplane because an airplane that was right next to it zoomed right past. Then we thought it was a helicopter but then it started to change colors and small lights appeared. It changed to red then orange and yellow blue ECT. beams. Then we told 2 of our friends and they didn’t believe us. They went inside and left us. Everybody didn’t believe us but we did. We went to get a camera but we had no film. We went back out and it was slowly moving behind a cloud. We looked at the other end and it never came out.<n>

Moments later, I looked up and there was a silvery object flying through the sky!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 14 year old male who is employed with the BC Baseball Umpiring Association of Canada. After I finished umpiring my two back-to-back games, I decided when I got home, that I would swim in my pool. So I changed in my bathing suit and headed toward my pool at 12:00 in the morning. The first thing I did was look up at the stars, basically because I am very interested in ufology, astronomy, chemistry and physics. I floated on my back in the water just staring up, looking for constallations that I could spot. All of a sudden, I hear a crackle by the fence, (which ran parallel to our neighbour&#39;s backyard). I found out pretty quickly that it was the rustling of leaves on the tree beside my house, over-hanging our pool. Then I turned around, and there was this object approaching me. It was moving in a south-easterly direction toward me. It couldn&#39;t have been a &#34;shooting star&#34; because shooting stars only travel about 3 to 4 feet when you look at it form Earth. And it couldn&#39;t have been a medeorite or a comet, because this bright glowing object didn&#39;t appear to have a tail. And it was moving too fast to be an aircraft manufactured by the likes of your current technology. It came out of the trees form nowhere, passed over my house and pool, and was gone in 5 sec! onds. I stood there dumbfounded. I can&#39;t explain any other detailed appearance, as I never caught a glimpse of the shape it was moving so fast. I was the only witness to this incredible phenomena.<n>

A booming sound was heard, but it was muffled. The fireball started out as yellow, then turned orange, with a green tail spreading out about the width of a full moon. The green color dissapated slowly and appeared to phosphoresce as it faded. Total time streaking across the sky was about 6 seconds. The phosphorescence lasted an additonal 4-5 seconds. I tried to get the attention of the other boater before it faded, but, insofar as he was turned northward, and the object was at about 60 degrees up in the Southern sky, he did not turn and focus in time to see the whole thing.The boat engine did sputter and almost quit when the object crossed the sky, but ran o.k. thereafter.<n>

A row of trees follow the road in front of her house, obstructing most of the sky in that direction. That&#39;s why I found it so unusual to see lights in the sky coming down the road from that direction. I immediately knew, from years of being on the porch, that you can not see airplanes in the sky from there when the tree&#39;s are full of leaves in the summer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up and walked out to the road so the trees would not obstruct my vision. One of my friends followed me. We saw a cigar shaped aircraft, flying from left to right in our direction. It was upright or vertical. We could not see the actual craft, but a red light on the top and bottom- solid, not blinking- gave us an idea of what shape it was. By the time we reached the road to see it, it was some 600 yards away, no more than 500 feet off the ground. It was silent and around 100 feet in height. We only got a full, unobstructed view for about five to ten seconds before it went behind a large hill directly across from our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The friend that saw it with me was quite excited, and his loud exclamations of &#34;Holy ****!&#34; brought the other three people off of the porch to see what the commotion was all about. We told them what happened. As we were about to get in a car and drive down the road to the other side of the hill and see where the object had gone, a white light, about half the size of the original object, arose from behind the hill about 300 yards from where we were. It quickly shot directly up and disappeared into the night sky. Once again, there was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We remained outside for several hours. With all of us excited about what we had seen, we spent much of that time gazing at the stars. Because of that, we observed two other strange objects that otherwise would have went unnoticed. They were like dim stars, seemingly not within the atmosphere. I originally thought they were satellites, as I had observed them before. The peculiar thing was there were two of them, with the second trailing the lead one closely. We watched them go halfway across the sky above us, at about the speed of a satelitte, when suddenly the lead light made a 90 degree turn to our right. The second followed accordingly. Their speed remained constant, and we watched them disappear over the western horizon. If there would only have been one, and it had not have turned, I would have thought it normal space debris. However, due to its maneuvering, I believe it obviously was not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and have found him to be exceptionally credible.  This is one of two reports submitted by the same witness.  The date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Told my friend and got the binocluars to get a closer look, to make sure it wasn&#39;t the moon. Saw through the binoculars a round white/yellow light, partially blocked by the trees. My friend said she saw a face and body outline in the window. Not human looking. More she looked at it the more clear it looked. I have seen many UFO&#39;s around my  house. Believe to be possibly abducted. I have reported them through this network before. My friend has also seen UFO&#39;s before and believe to have been abducted. The light also had beams coming off it, like it would have to be bright, the area around the light, below, was lite up by it. There is a house right where this object was.<n>

The object followed us all the way back to his house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 2 am on Sunday morning, July 23, 1997 my friend and I were driving home from Atco Multiplex Theatres in Atco, NJ..  We were about 1 and 1/2 miles from his house when we saw a what seemed to be a strobe light directly over his car on Fairview Rd. in Medford, NJ.  Curious, we wanted to get a better view of the lights, if there was anything to see.  We pulled into a stone parking lot at a nearby baseball field that would allow an unobstructed view of the sky.  Upon stopping and getting out of his vehicle we turned around to see if anything remained in the sky.  At that point we observed an object hovering (it make no noise whatsoever) over the treeline across the road.  After about 10-20 seconds, the object threw on all of its lights and carme across the road toward us.  We jumped into his car, got back to the road, and took off. The object proceeded to follow us down the road at high speed.  It remained at a stable altitude just above the treeline on the right side ! of the road.  After following us for about 1/2 of a mile, it changed direction and cruised directly over his car.  We got a great view!  It was a dark, triangle-shaped object with several lights on the bottom of it.  We then had to make a left turn to get back to his house.  Upon arriving there (about 1/4 mile from where it passed over his car), it was hovering directly over his house.  We jumped out of the car and raced inside.  We scurried into the basement where I called my folks to tell them what had happened.  At that time, for reasons unknown, his car alarm went off.  We had put his car in the garage upon arriving there, so naturally we were frightened.  He turned it off by remote from his kitchen, and we did not investigate.  We locked the doors and retreated to the basement where we drew pictures of the object and talked about it.  The next day his Mom called the police and no one else had reported any objects like what we had seen.  I am doing so now because I rece! ntly discovered the UFO Reporting Center. I would be happy to describe the events in detail to anyone who would listen.<n>

I live in the heart of the city, about 2 miles from the lakefront and the city skyline.  The urban light blocks out most of the stars and anything else in the sky.  I have seen some satellites from the city, so I am familiar with how they look.  As I was watching the sky that night, I noticed three moving lights.  They weren&#39;t very bright and where all white, so they weren&#39;t a usual plane using O&#39;Hare or Midway.  The lights were in a single-file line equidistant from each other, and when they moved, they moved in formation.  I had the impression they were connected.    I also heard no sound from them as they crossed.  They moved faster than any satellite I have seen and I had the impression that they were much lower than a satellite.  The lights moved from south to north.  They only took about ten seconds at the most to move out of sight, and I have watched satellites from the city for at least five minutes before I lost sight of them. I have always been interested in UFO&#39;s since I was a kid, but this is the first time I have seen something in the sky that I can not identify based on circumstances.  I am a pretty good sceptic, I don&#39;t believe in the existence of something but I also don&#39;t believe in the non-existence of something unless I have the proof of either in front of me.<n>

On the evening of July 26, 1997 I was washing my car at a self-serve car wash on the north east side of Warrensburg Mo. next to highway 50.  The sky was clear and there were still a couple of hours until sunset.  I noticed 2 dark objects hovering over the south-central side of town, about 2 miles away, at an altitude of about 1500 feet AGL.  The objects were identical, each consisting of an equilateral triangle with a sphere at each corner.  The thickness of the triangular portion was approximately one quarter of the objects&#39; length, with the spherical sections&#39; diameter about twice the thickness of the triangular section.  They appeared to be about 100 to 150 feet long.  The objects were flat black in color with no visible markings, intake/exhaust ports, or windows.  I could not hear any sounds from the objects.  The southern most object did not move at all, watching it was like staring at a photograph.  The northern most object only occasionally yawed from left to right about 60 degrees in each direction.  Its position in relation to the unmoving object never changed.  After about 45 minutes, I turned away to insert more coins in the car wash, and when I turned back, the objects were gone.  Less than a minute after the objects disappeared, three A-10 attack aircraft from Whiteman AFB flew over me less than 200 feet up, they were heading west, paralleling highway 50.  I could see that the only ordinance they were carrying were sidewinder air to air missiles.  The A-10s turned south and flew over the center of Warrensburg, towards the previous location of the objects.  At that location, they broke formation and continued south along slightly different vectors.  For the remainder of my Air Force career, I did not report my sighting, nor even tell anyone about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had my brother look at it and he thought it was the moon. But I told him to watch it and he said it couldn&#39;t be since it was changing shape and color. I watched it and it kept getting smaller, then larger. When it got small it turned yellow and then it turned really dark outside. When it got big it started changing shapes an and colors, and outside got lit up. Then it disappeared. Then a couple minutes later, it came back and turned into a baseball field shape, there was a blue and red light coming off it. The middle was missing, like a ring. The object was white and lit up. Before it disappeard, it turned into a little tiny dot, then moved up out of my sight and disappeared. It hasn&#39;t been back since.<n>

Within seconds, it seemed to not disappear, but explode, appearing as if to come in contact with my ex- boyfriend&#39;s house, whom I had broken up with only days earlier. The light from the explosion lit as far as I could see and it really did seem like it was 12:00. Unvoluntarily, I was &#34;escorted&#34; back to my bed and pulled my covers over myself and rolled back into the fetal position that I normally sleep in. Immediately, I was able to control myself. I lept from bed and called my ex to see if he had a clue what I was talking about and I also confronted my family about the bright light. No one else had noticed a thing. The main things I remember was that the UFO was about the size of my fist, perhaps a quarter of a mile away from me, it was white/yellowish and at impact it emitted a brilliant white/blue light that sent a kind of &#34;hot flash&#34; through me as it shined. I remember not being able to move and being forced to watch this occurance. The night sky also seemed to not have any other stars that were visible either. The moon was also not visible, but when I was able to move, reappeared. The stars never reappeared. Colfax is a forest setting and the UFO grazed the treetops in its descent. I have never seen a light this bright before. To this day, if I close my eyes, I still see the outlin! e of the fireball and can relive every moment of the &#34;encounter&#34;.<n>

My background is that myself and my family saw the extraterrestrial craft of March 13, 1997 fly directly over our house.  Our family was featured in the USA Today article on June 18, 1997 and then on various TV programs. 	I had been sitting in my back yard with my son-in-law Danny Pasqualini and grandson Adrian.  We had been talking about the March 13th sighting and then the return of the craft on June 25th.  We were trying to understand where did the people on the craft come from?  I told them about a outline of a story I wrote in 1966 which could possibly explain where these people were from. I recounted the story of Windsloop, a man living at some time after the destruction of the world. At one point in the story he is &#34;captured&#34; by &#34;extraterrestrials&#34;.  Everyone thought the world had been devastated by the &#34;gods&#34; and the world was only now in its &#34;feudal&#34; stage.  There was no real science or technology nor people that could operate technology. We find out that right before the destruction, an armada of space ships left the earth with scientists and mechanics and technicians and scholars etc.  They knew destruction was coming and they wanted to preserve civilization.  They travelled for ove! r 100 years and arrived at an earth-like planet. They prospered and developed for 300 years and finally developed faster-than-light travel.  They immediately sent &#34;scout&#34; ships back to earth and found it devastated.  They built a huge ship, over 1 mile in diameter filled with everything they would need to &#34;resurrect&#34; the earth and its people. Windsloop ends up joining up with the &#34;returnees&#34; and agrees to be an &#34;agent for rebirth&#34; of the planet earth. Right after I finished the story and we stood up, and looked to the western sky, where the sun had gone down while we had been sitting there. Out of nowhere we saw an object moving through the sky west of us, perhaps 500 feet away and up about 200 feet. It was solid black and had a rounded triangular shape. The first thing we noticed was its absolute silence.  At first we thought it was a balloon, but after watching it for 10 seconds or so we knew it was not a balloon. Its movement was too deliberate and too rapid to be a balloon! .  It was moving diagonally from the southwest to the northeast directly in front of us and then passed us on the north side of my property heading slightly northeast until we lost it in the darker eastern sky. It almost seemed to fly out at 300 feet around the edge of my property first on the west side then on the north.  It made absolutely no sound at all at any time.  We had just seen a small plane come from the west towards us and we could here its engine from a couple of miles away. This thing passed within 300 feet of us as it passed by us on the north side of my yard. It&#39;s altitude over the area was only about 200 feet up but as it headed northeast it went higher. It was completely black against the dimly lit background sky and it seemed to have a slight glow on either side of it towards the rear.  The glow seemed to come from the other side of the object as if there was a light source of some kind on the other side of the object and it was &#34;bleeding&#34; over the edge so ! it could be seen just as an edge glow, slightly reddish and yellow on each side. From that view it seemed this object was facing its &#34;bottom&#34; away from us as it went around us. Its profile seemed almost spherical; but more oval at the leading end, so it almost seemed like a very rounded triangle with the point leading and the glow on both sides of the base end. We all were astonished because there was no earthly explanation for what we had just seen. Danny was saying &#34;what the heck is that?&#34;  I said &#34;What do you think it is? Its a flyover by one of those craft. What else could it be?&#34;  And we were even more astonished because we had just been talking about the visitors and where might they have come from.  For the three of us, it was not a coincidence that this UFO showed up at that moment.  It was a verification for us that there are people on these craft and they are deliberately letting us see them, and that they were here at God&#39;s behest to help mankind.<n>

There were portholes where a &#34;hat band&#34; might be.  No noise, no movement.  I looked for people on the street so I could point it out.  No one was around.  I was waiting for a bus.  It arrived.  I got on and left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked to the corner of Wilshire Blvd. and Westgate Avenue in West Los Angeles to catch a bus.  It was about July 23, 1997, 12:30 pm.  While waiting, I looked up at the tall buildings to my left (east)and saw a craft hovering between two buildings.  It was shaped like a top hat, and had portholes where a hat band might be.  It did not move,it did not make noise.  There was a lot of automobile traffic on the blvd., but I saw no pedestrians on the street so I could point it out to them. I knew for sure that people in the high rises around would and could see it if they looked.  I gazed at it the whole time until the bus came. When the bus came, I got on the bus and left. What amazed me about the encounter was that I was not startled, not afraid, not shaken at all.  I felt a kind of communication as if they were saying, &#34;We see you.&#34;  And I was saying, &#34;Yes, and I see you too.&#34; In a way it was comforting.  Almost like being watched over. Several nights later I had a dream that I was caught up into a &#34;round room&#34; with windows all around.  I could see the skyline of West Los Angeles.  I was there with my sister and my two nieces.  Each of us had an instructor/guide/teacher.  Each of us were totally in thrall and occupied intensely with what each teacher was saying that we hardly acknowledged each other.  My teacher was beautiful.  He had shoulder- length blonde hair, about 32 years old, with a bare chest.  He was loving, gentle and kind.  As I sat mesmerized in his teaching, I found myself wanting to embrace him.  His skin was so beautiful.  It smelled wonderful too.  (I can still remember the fragrance)  He gently and laughingly distracted me from this lustful pursuit and refocused my attention on his teaching. I felt that this visit was a &#34;check-up&#34; to see how we were all doing. It was more a spiritual and mystical and metaphysical exam, not a physical one.  After each of us were through with our private lessons, my guide went to the front of the &#34;room&#34; and at a board or screen was teaching us all.  It was a lesson about time.  In essence what I remember him saying was that there was no such thing as time, but that it was a concept that we earthlings/encarnates agree upon believing in for the &#34;time being.&#34; After all the lessons, the &#34;room&#34; started spinning and we lifted up and away, and I looked down and recognized Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, the Hollywood Hills and the San Bernardino mountains in the distance to the east.  I felt as though it was just a &#34;joy ride&#34; for us &#34;kids,&#34; as a &#34;reward.&#34; I choose not to submit my name or any personal information.  I don&#39;t need any MIB&#39;s harassing me.  I&#39;m sane, drug/alcohol free, 55 yrs old. Occupation medical researcher/writer.  None of the characteristics below apply and you know what a top hat looks like.<n>

It appeared to be at roof level and then went higher in the air, clearing the house roof and continuing across the street . It had come from the northeast and went southwest. I had my neighbor come out and she saw it as it was much higher in the sky and about 6 other people down the street were watching it also, but it was high in the sky to them also. Shapewise, it appeared to be circular, clear orange and just floating above garage roof. We, the observers range in the 30-48 age with two being teenagers. Our local police officer was called after it had gone thru and he informed me that about two months ago he had seen an object that he could not explain.<n>

Back in 1997, my wife and I  were working out on our deck at our old place in Port Orford, Oregon. It was in July, and I can&#39;t find my old Diary to get an exact date but it was like the 12th or thereabouts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d noticed a little twin turbo-prop with funny markrings: Parallel  red stripes on the wings. Also _I couldn&#39;t Identify the type!!_ it was a combination of Cessna/Beechcraft/ Piper Turboprops. (I&#39;ve flown or been around -all- of the  common types.) Also, there was no discernible registration number I&#39;d estimate the altitude to be no more than 2500 ft.agl. What was very curious, was the fact that it would fly over the coastline (ocean was 1/4 mile away and US 101 .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this little Twin Turboprop hung around for hours, it was at low altitude, hardly efficiently using fuel. It was at least 4 hours in the Air over Port Orford, flying back and forth over the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife looked up at the Little plane and said &#34;what&#39;s THAT?&#34; Here was a white &#34;football&#34; with a black stripe around the middle (about 2:00 pm)  and it was moving  north to south at about the same altitude as the Twin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Abruptly the Twin turned and was gone over the Treeline south following the &#39;Football&#39; the  Football appeared to be about 1/4 the size of the Twin. They  were quite close for a while about a wingspan (30-35 ft, ) apart. Then watching this ,high in the sky was a large cigar-shape heading west to east, no way to tell how high it was or how large. just well above this other show.I know it wasn&#39;t a large jet.-no wings or tail. my wife and I used our 8X50 binocs, on all of this, to no avial on detail just closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When I did, I noticed two boomerang shaped craft, that appeared to be shiny metallic objects. they were about 2 miles away and were just over the top of the mountain at about 10,000 feet.  They were making circles.  They would go up very fast to about 20,000 feet, then disappear. Then they would return. I went inside and got my telescope and they almost looked ( unreal). This went on for 2+ hours, and they made no sound. I was a police officer, and have be in the marines, and have never seen anything like this. I have had stealth&#39;s and F1-111&#39;s from Holloman fly over, but nothing like this.  I had other strange things happen out there, but will not discuss over the net.

It might have been new mexico. I was passing by a solar power station and noticed two white clouds on top of what looked like an antenna tower. At first, I thought it was just gas being expelled. As I got closer I noticed that the clouds were&#39;nt moving as they would if it was gases being expelled. Then it seemed that the two little clouds were two dimensional. As the bus was mid-passed the solar plant, the mountains in background were lined up behind the clouds. Then things got stranger as I could see all the way to the mountains through the clouds. It was like they were far away and yet only a short ways away at the same time. This was very strange. Please, get back with me if you&#39;ve ever had a reporting like this.<n>

First thought: shooting star but much too large for placement in sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saw very bright flare-shaped light in sky.  Very like flare from a firework.  Then, realized it was way too large for how far up in the sky it was to be any flare.  Then, thought it was like a shooting star.  Again, too intense, too colorful (yellow/orange) and did not have trajectory I have seen with real shooting stars.  It also stayed in the sky longer than shooting stars.  The flare shape elongated to almost a line, still quite colorful and bright, and it was covered by cloud formation.  When it emerged (15 seconds approx) later, it seemed to be a single light! Small! No sound (although I have no idea if sound could be heard because I don&#39;t know how to really estimate how far away it was).  Then, it rather slowly continued east and went behind another very thin formation of cloud coverage.  I never saw it again!  The sky was clear except for this very thin cloud formation.  I fully expected to be able to see it &#34;on the other side.&#34;<n>

I am still bewildered. I was at a friend&#39;s place discussing a future project. About 10:20 PM I left the building to go back home. I got out of the side door and walked across the parking lot. The sky tonight is fairly clear, except a few clouds here and there. Suddenly on top of the clouds I saw what I first thought a cloud moving faily quick towards the North. As it passed the small group of clouds it was actually a group of five circles in some V formation, with 4 of the cricles on the right side, and one on the left. They were, and I noticed, evenly spaced. The color was some sort of light gray, paler than the clouds. I look down then up and it was still there, moving at a nonchalant speed direction North. Wow! Whatever it was it faded in the sky as it moved away (not because it disappeared, but because of the distance). I ran back to  my friend Mike&#39;s place and tried to reach him but the intercom was dead (usual). I ran under is porch and yell! ed his name. He and his girlfriend ran down to see what was happening. After telling them and looking for a while (it had been gone for a few minutes by then) I ran upstairs and drew what I saw on an envelop ( 4 frames ). Don&#39;t take me wrong, I am not a hardcore disbeliever, but I tend to believe that everything can be explained (especially UFO cases) but this one is a little tougher. It was not a reflection on the clouds, it was on top of them (they were really sparse too). It was not an airplane, it was too high. I called places to find out what the ceiling was but I could not find a place that would report that. I got on the web trying to find something and I got here by curiosity. It was not balloons, it travelled to fast (when I say it, I mean the formation). The formation was going at the same speed throughout the experience. I don&#39;t know what it was! I need to find out what the cloud ceiling was tonight a top Montreal so I can make approximations as to the size of the circles. Also was there a radar somewhere that could have recorded this? I&#39;m sending this then going back outside.<n>

Our parents had purchased each of us new telescopes for Christmas that year.  We use to memorize all the constellations and view the night sky together occasionally.  That summer our families were vacationing at my parents’ cottage on Beaver Island MI.  We had supposed that the latitude of the island, being farther north than our regular homes, would allow us to see the aurora.  The night in question she and I went down to Donegal bay to view the aurora.  The beach faced west toward a smaller uninhabited island called High Island.  We were told that the best way to see the aurora from the island was to look northwest between 10:30 and 2:00.  We set up our telescopes on a small dune – grass mound about 40 yards from the shore, slightly elevated, and close to the car.  We did in fact see the aurora that night; it was a shimmering folded mass of light in the very upper atmosphere.  It was not to be confused ! with what happened after about an hour of our beach sky watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> High Island is roughly 3-4 miles from where we were sitting on the hood of my parents&#39; old station wagon.  While watching the sky and chatting with my cousin, I saw what looked like a fire on High Island.  It was definitely at the level of the water, and it silently erupted into a long line of fire red light.  In fact I was alarmed, I could not tell if it was on the island itself or over the water (the light was coming from High Island bay at the north east end of High Island).  Initially I thought perhaps either the island was burning, or one of the passing ships had an accident and was in flames.  The light started as a small point like a bon fire on the shore and rapidly grew into a long line of connected orbs like a great burning dragon.  I think the ambiguity I saw was because of the distance, the truth of what it was became evident shortly.  I was so alarmed at this point I tried to use the old style cell phone we had in the car to call the sheriff and report a fire! on High Island.  However, when I tried to use the phone there was oddly no signal.  Later that night, when we returned to the cottage, we called the Charlevoix fire dept., and tried to report what we saw but were dismissed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After perhaps five minutes the string of light started to raise itself above the water level in the distance.  It was a very quiet night and I heard no sound from this U.F.O.  Then it very gracefully started getting closer to our position on the beach, and we started getting very scared.  It came slowly toward us, and as it ventured closer we could see that it was a machine.  The water was flat and calm, it was a dark night and the only light came from the craft.  It was definitely a machine.  Its proportions were symmetrical, and its hull was black.  Image, if you will, standing on a large beach on a quite night and seeing this machine quietly coming over the water directly toward you slowly.  It was frightening for me; in fact I can remember crouching next to the car while gazing up at it as it passed directly overhead.  It was moving slowly, perhaps 15 -20 miles an hour.  It was perhaps 150 feet above us, not far above the trees as it passed south east over Beaver Island! .  When it was directly overhead I could hear a faint humming, and felt a strange tingling, maybe the craft maybe my nerves?  These figures are estimates.  I believe it was fairly large perhaps 50 yards across its lower aspect.  It was a perfect equilateral triangle, and I mean each of the three sides was approximately 50 yards across.  The red lights were in fact three reddish - purple spheres each placed at the points of the triangle.  The center of this appeared somewhat domed, not like the typical U.F.O curvature though.  It was shaped as if someone made a very gradual domed pancake like structure in the Y axis and an equilateral triangle in the x axis.  I wish I could have had a better look at it, but it was pitch black and the lighted structures within it obscured more detail in that setting.  The sound it made was only audible when it was directly overhead, and it was a very faint, rhythmic, low frequency humming.  I have never heard anything quite like it and have d! ifficulty comparing it to anything.  It was vaguely like the s! ound you hear when you drop something very heavy on well compacted soil.  From the moment we saw it start moving in our direction to the moment it passed over the trees on the bluffs behind the bay it moved slowly and very steadily.  Its course did not vary one millimeter, it flew straight and true.  I was absolutely amazed that it flew overhead.  I believe whoever was in control of that craft was aware of our presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after it had passed my cousin and I were wired, scared and exited we drove back to the cottage to report the events to our families.  We explained what had happened and the reaction was obvious disbelief.  My mother kept trying to convince me I had seen an air plane or something like that.  The fact is I grew up around airplanes, my grandfather, and father are both private pilots.  In fact to get to Beaver Island we would fly over the lake in one of their planes.  I was flying in airplanes since I was an infant.  I use to help my grandfather Windex every square inch of his airplane at my uncle’s airport.  I can say with absolute certainty that this was not an airplane.  This vehicle was not held aloft by aerodynamic means, nor was it propelled by forcing air or any other matter in a vectored manner.  It was a craft half the size of a football field that moved so quietly you could hear a pin drop standing 150 feet below it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know people believe my story is absurd.  In fact, whenever I mention this to my cousin she gets nervous and suppresses the memory.  I believe she is afraid of this event.  I think it was more traumatic for her than I.  I know in my heart that these beings were aware of our presence, and if they wished us any ill will I would not be alive right now.  There was no one else on the bay that night except us, and we could have disappeared without a trace if that was their intention.  Whoever they were I know they are kind and intelligent.  They are aware enough of our human culture to recognize two youths alone on the beach with telescopes trying to understand the universe in our own small way.  It is my belief that they wanted to show us some kindness, and inspire us by flying by.  They gave me just enough proof to believe in the possibilities.  They could have chosen 359 other degrees to fly along, but for some reason they flew along the one that led over our heads. No pun in! tended.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In conclusion, I would like to thank you for this forum to report my experience.  It changed my life, and I always wanted to share this with someone who would be receptive to the possibility.  I wish I could give you my details, but understand your concerns for privacy.  I know I have no proof to offer you, but on further reflection you may wish to investigate the Beaver Island Moon Rocks.  They are a group of stones carved in some language that predates the Native American’s, who had no written language anyway, and glow at night.  They are on Beaver Island and are said to be involved in several plane crashes.  Apparently the tribes that found them used the rocks for rituals such as the birth, death, marriage stones etc….  Beaver Island has many strange historical characteristics, it may be related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Sometime in either June or July of 1997. My friend ((name deleted)) and I were sitting on my porch in Hopewell Va.. Which at that time I lived behind Hardees off of Miles Ave. Well, while we were sitting there we noticed  a bright White light in the sky. So, we didn&#39;t really think much of it. We just thought it was probly a search and rescue light from a Police helicopter because, it was moving slowly across the sky like a helicopter would. About a min. goes by and then we were thinking maybe it&#39;s headlights on a plane but, the (plane) was travling pretty slow. About another min. goes by then, we noticed something really odd as, it was getting closer. The White light seemed to give off a shine to the ships underbelly. It was then when we noticed that the ship was not a helicopter or a plane. It was round just like a saucer. Then the ship stoped. Then White light on the bottom of the ship started to change colors. From a White light to Blue ,then Red, then White again. The light was changin these 3 colors and they were picking up speed. Then from a dead standstill the the ship darted off in an up rightward slanted postion in the sky. It was one of the most amazing things I have even seen in my life. The ship was gone in the blink of an eye..literally. My friend and I were in shock by what we had seen. We discussed the event and realized we had just seen a flying saucer. It was a few yr.&#39;s later that I realized somthing really even more odd about the whole event. 1st 0ff the ship looked Terran made (man made). 2nd The lights were changing to Red, White, and Blue. Just like you would see as if an airplane was flying through the sky at night. If you ask me in my opinion it was not Alien but, the US Airforce and that when the ship darted off it left at, what appeard to be some form of light travel or close to it. I would just be happy to find out wether or not any Airports in the surronding area had seen anything on radar or not. If anyone feels free to investigate t! his for me I would be really, really gratefull thank you for letting me get this off of my chest. P.S.

Hoping to fall asleep, I began gazing out the window, up at the stars. Then I noticed small white lights dashing in all directions arcoss the sky.I&#39;d say there were about five of them.I watched them for awhile, wondering what they were. Then as half-way as a joke, I went to get the most powerful flash-light I could find. Then I returned to the window, and then started flashing the light towards them. They seemed to respond, flashing back as flashed. I even flashed the light in a sequence,once every two seconds, and they repeated it back to me. Right after that, a large,oval-shaped,creamy-white light,with a haze of the same color all around it, flashed right behind a tree about twenty feet away from the window.It looked like it was hovering, didn&#39;t land, but just stayed there for a second.It only did this once. I was so scared, I put the light out, pulled down the shades, and tried to find a different way to get to sleep. The next night, I had a friend stay the night with me. I&#39;d told her about it, and we wanted to see if they would appear again. Again,the smaller lights appeared, and We both saw them. And we tried flashing them with the flash-light, but the large oval light never showed itself to us, or me again.<n>

It was a hot|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38232.html|50|ndxe199707| My husband had been sitting the computer in our den when he noticed rotating red, white and blue lights in our back yard.  It was a hot, dark summer night and the windows were open.  He did not hear any sound and although he looked up into the night sky to see where the lights were coming from, he could not see anything.  He came to bed and woke me up saying, &#34;Look out the window and tell me what you see.&#34;  I had to put my eyeglasses on to see.  I got on my knees and looked one of two windows that overlook our back yard.  I could see the rotating lights.  The lights moved continuously from one side to the other along our neighbors fence.  They also ran perfectly between two sheds in our back yard.  The lights stayed inside the space between the sheds and only shone on the tall picket fence.  My first thought was that the police were in his yard shining their lights but his fence pickets are close together so that much light would not be able to shine on our side of his fence like they were.  I then looked out a third window in our bedroom which looks over our driveway onto the main road near our home hoping to see a police car or a fire truck.  I saw nothing.  My heart was pounding and I was curious as to what was causing these lights to shine in our back yard.  I then walked into our son&#39;s bedroom in the front of the house.  His room has two windows, one over the driveway and one in the front overlooking the entire front yard.  I pulled up the blinds and looked from left to right seeing absolutely no police or fire trucks.  What was going on?  I was getting scared now.  I walked to the other side of our home into the dining room.  The windows in the dining room face the front yard and the side yard facing our next door neighbor.  It was pitch black outside.  Although we have trees surrounding our home we can still see moonshine if the moon is up.  I have never checked any almanac to see what cycle the moon was in on July 18, 1997 but I bet there was no moonlight.  It was pitch!  I saw no police or fire trucks.  I cannot imagine what other vehicle could be emitting these lights except a police car or a fire truck.  No other lights that I know of rotate like the kind on top of a police car and these lights were closer to that type of fast rotation but they were faster.  So now the only place I could go to get a last look would be into the den where my husband had originally seen the lights.  Mind you, he never told me what he saw ... he only told me to look up from the bed I had been sleeping in and tell him what I saw!  When I got to the sliding doors, I was afraid.  I froze!  By this time I had been thinking about where these lights could be coming from and since I had not seen or heard anything from the opened windows that would give me a single clue as to where these lights were coming.  The only logical idea I could come up with was, &#34;What if there is a burglar in our yard with some sort of &#34;spectacular&#34; flashlight or something along those lines?&#34;  &#34;What if this burglar sees me in the den?&#34;  &#34;He might see me seeing him and I live here ... I was so scared.&#34;  I could not open the sliding door to enter the den to look out those windows.  Instead I walked back to our bedroom.  I asked my husband if he thought maybe we had left the light in the sunroom on ... maybe we had left the light and the fan on.&#34;  I wondered out loud if that would make the lights in the back yard.  I was grasping at straws, I admit that now but then I was just trying to figure out every conceivable idea that might make some sense.  I asked him if he wanted to go downstairs with me to check the sunroom.  He did not want to go.  So, I just kneeled on the bed and strained my eyes and ears to hear anything.  I may have kneeled that way for another ten minutes and then the lights just stopped.  I waited to hear crunching sounds on the ground and there was not a single sound of any kind.  I lay down and my heart was pounding out of my chest.  We eventually went to sleep.  In the morning I went downstairs to open the curtains to the sunroom to see if the lights and ceiling fan were on.  They were off!  I walked into the room and went right up to the glass windows which run from the ceiling to the floor to see if there were any footprints in the grass.  It&#39;s a stretch but I wanted to look for any clue that might make the whole incident more &#34;earth bound&#34; than unidentified!  About a month after this event, I was reading the Eagle Tribune and in the Sound Off portion of the paper where folks can call in a question or voice an opinion, I read a short story where a caller wanted to know if anyone had noticied the rotating lights that were shining for about an hour one night over the dump in Derry.  I have never seen or heard anything else about these lights in this area.  We never told our neighbors or called the local authorities to report.  That was seven years ago just this past Sunday and I finally feel that enough time has elapsed that I can write about it.  It would be interesting to know if anyone else in Salem, NH has ever seen lights like this or had a similar experience.  Thanks!<n>

We stopped and watched it disappear in the horizon. The question we have to ask our selves is what would we gain or loose if the government finally told the public about the now famous Roswell crash, the alien abductions and the ongoing ufo activity. Logically speaking, if this craft would be government made, wouldn&#39;t it be most top secret (area 51), and if it was, what was it doing flying between large cities, woudn&#39;t these test be dangerous for the general public, if they were safe wouldn&#39;t we profit from it by improving today&#39;s latest planes and if they were from another country, wouldn&#39;t the army have intercepted this illigal alien threatening our country. The most logical answer would be that somekind of being is flying far more technologically advanced craft of anything we have on earth. Obviously we can&#39;t catch one or catch up to it, they abduct people and we haven&#39;t the slight idea how to stop them, if they crash, we steal their technology. Isn&#39;t that evolution for which humans thrives? I think we are ready to know the truth, the real truth!!<n>

It made a perfect diamond shape in the sky, then all four lights, switched positions at different times, (ex: the west light moved to east and east to west and so on and this took place for about 5 or 6 minutes,the movement of the lights was blink of an eye fast. then I called the city police officer with my cell phone, and he came out to check it out, and I asked him what it was and he said he had never seen something like that before, but a farmer north of town had reported lights to him about a week before that. the whole episode went on for about 15-20 minutes then they just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was walking to the store to get some smokes and I was watching crows fly over head. The crows fly over head every day at that time. So I was checking the birds out and I noticed one was not moving.  The day was mostly clear and the object was easy to see. It was still and dark with no lights(day light) I could not see lights anyway.  I looked at it for a couple of minutes when I figured I better get someone out here so I would not look like a freak talking about a ufo! Which I did anyways!  So I grabbed a salesman at my work and we both looked at it for a couple of minutes.  He ended up getting paged and I was left alone to look at it.  I decided I better go to the corner store and get some smokes for bowling. When I got there I was in line talking about what was up in the air about 3000ft I guess. after I told a guy and the guy that worked there we all left the store to look at it. it was still there after all that time.  the guy that worked there yelled something(arabic) and went back in!  the other guy just was amazed and told me he always wanted to see one and now he has! I left back to my work which was just a couple of hundreds of feet away so I could leave because I was supposed to be with my dad soon for bowling. So as I walked back I was thinking of grabbing a camera the one that we use to take pictures of customers when they buy a car. but I figured I would take too long looking for it and I wanted to look at it a bit longer.  As I looked at this dark triangle I noticed the bigger end looked like it had sharper wing like ends to it. It didn&#39;t move this whole time. It just sat there over highway 99 and just was quiet and still as can be.  One thing I noticed was when I took my eyes off of it, it was hard to find right off.  It was clear to see when looking at it but you take your eyes off it for a second you had a little bit of focusing you had to do. I looked at it one last time and I must have blinked because it was gone!  just a slight vapor spot not strip like you see with jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I wish I remembered a more accurate date, but I did not record any information after it occurred; family and friends basically made me feel embarrassed for telling this story… which is why I have not formally reported it until now.  I was age 17 at the time of this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 1997, I lived in Kokomo, Indiana, and at about 11:30 PM on a weeknight, I was on my way (driving) to a local Kroger store to see my girlfriend off of work.  I was on S Dixon Rd., heading north as I passed over some train tracks and began approaching a bridge when I noticed a solid bright white light at my 1 or 2-o-clock in the sky.  At first I thought it was pretty far away, but as I continued to drive north I realized that the object was now at my 3-o-clock, and so was actually very close to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, I became curious and turned right on to W King St., which appeared to lead directly to the hovering object.  As I drove towards the object, I pulled up to a house in the residential area that this object was apparently hovering over.  The house was on my right, and so I stuck my head out of the driver’s side window and looked over the hood of my car, up above this house… to see a large black triangular object with 3 bright white lights at each tip, and in the center of the triangle was one large deep red circle (facing downward at the house).  I was fortunate to have been able to observe this object from such a close distance; I remember it being about 150 yards away from me while it hovered over the house.  I was also amazed at how quietly the object hovered, as I remember hearing nothing over the sound of my own car engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat with my head out of the window observing the large triangle for about 1½ minutes before the object began to slowly rise and move in a NW direction, after which it then took off at very high velocity.  As far as I know, I was the only observer of this object, as almost all of the houses in the neighborhood appeared to have their lights off and I saw no other cars on the road.  I never heard of any news of a sighting reported by anyone else after that evening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

That is when I seen 2 star like objects &#34;white light as of a star&#34; Which I thought it was a star at first and also thought it was a bit strange that one was to the left of the moon and the other to the exact right. They were brighter than normal stars I thought so I observed them just because it was cool. Then I noticed they appeared to do a clockwise rotation very quickly around the moon back to there places they were at. I thought at this point that I must be seeing things so I pulled over off the exit to William st off 70 west and sat in my pickup truck bed. The stars kept doing the same rotation and it was very fast and I know that that is not normal. So After seeing this I needed a witness so I rushed home to pikeville to inform my roomate of this and in the 20 min it took to get home they stopped and dissapeared. I did not see them dissapear it is almost like they dimmed and blended back in with the regular stars.

I was the only car on the road for the time.  I noticed movement in the sky, so I slowed down to get a better look.  I saw what I first thought could have been an low flying airplane or a helicopter, then my view was obstructed by some trees hanging off a cliff where the road curves around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I rounded the curve I looked back at the object and noticed that it was moving in a figure eight pattern.  I slowed even more to get an even better look at it.  Then it took off in a streak of light at an angle but upwards into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was too far for me to make out any details, but it emitted a brilliant white light.  I would say that it was spherical or circular in shape from the shape of the light I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Suddenly, I was blinded by a bright light from directly overhead. My first impression was that an airplane was coming directly down at me with it&#39;s landing light on . I thought it would crach into the lake at any second. I looked around me and could see that the immediate area around my boat was illuminated by a white, bluish light. I could tell that the object overhead was turning as I could see the light on the water moving away from my boat. I looked back into the sky and could tell that the object was rotating and was not coming at me any more. I thought the &#34;plane&#34; was now safe and would not crash, but the &#34;plane&#34; continued to move directly away from me into the atmosphere and did not fly sideways (parallel to the horizon) as I had expected it to. The object finally disappeared into the night sky. I thought how quiet it was and that I did not hear any noise from the object, but I could still hear the crickets on the shore. The light was steady and did not blink and the object made no sound. Being blinded by the light at first, I could not really tell how high the object was, but it was fairly close and the light was very intense.<n>

It rose up to just slightly above the moon.  The second was, I would estimate, 15 minutes behind.  As the red one headed northwest, the white one rose from below the moon and trailed it at an even pace until they were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Observer Bkgd Info - 3 White Male teens of age 13, 13, 15.  One joined us later age 12.  No previously documented psichiatric problems.  All GPA&#39;s of 4.0 at the time except for the 15 year old, who was slightly lower than average. The first red light appeared at approximately 10:45 PM Eastern Standard time and was just below the visible bottom of the moon.  It sat there until about 11:00 than began to rise at an unhumanlike rate of velocity.  It travled upwards, and as it reached the visible top of the moon, a white one appeared.  It behaved just like the red one.  When the red light began to move northwest in the night sky, the white one began to trail it with an equal speed as if being towed from the moon by the red one.  We observed this for about an hour or so before they were out of sight. The crafts seemed to both be invisible to the naked eye shape and colorwise, just a red light and a white light.<n>

PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Triangular craft followed on foot, and gray at my window. Seperate and presumably unrelated experiences<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello Again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have decided to contact you about another of my past sightings. I never remember the exact dated, I probably should be writing them down, but at the time of the event I never seem to think about that, only wishing that I had a camcorder or decent camera to capture my experience. It was again in the summer, and later in the evening probably about 11:00 and my brother, and long time friend were outside looking at the night sky. Because the three of us have a history of being in the right place at the right time we often look for ufo&#39;s. Most of the time we go inside without any remarkable events, but sometimes we do see something we can&#39;t explain. Most of the things I&#39;ve seen were just odd lights behaving oddly, and could be anything really. But this one time it was definately a craft of uncommon design. Now weather it was experimental earthbound technology or extraterrestrial I will never know. As I stated in my previous posting that I live in the vacintity of sevral air ports both commertial and military, as well as sevral military bases, and I would assume sevral more that I&#39;m not aware of. So here&#39;s the story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were outside, when my friend looked up over the treeline and saw a large low altitude low speed triangular object. It had a red light at each corner, and it made absolutely no sound. It seemed to drift, and sort of reminded me of the way one of those toy hovercrafts moves, but with more stability. It was about 100 or 200 feet above the treeline and moved at a rate slow enough that we could walk and keep up with it. No sound or exhaust what so ever. We followed it around the block for about thirty minutes after watching it for about 10 or 15 in our front yard before it moved off in a direction that we did not have street access to follow, and so we watched it as it dissapeared in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of all the sightings I have had, that was the first where the actual body of the craft was visible. It was very large, about 200 feet acrost, and moved in a slow lazy fascioun, sort of like the occupants had no worries about being seen. As I above stated about the glut of local airports large and small, there was no way in hell that what ever we saw was unnoticed by radar towers, and other people. Being the most up close and personal encounter of such a large and obvious craft in the sky, I am asking anyone reading on this board who is also from Fayetteville NC, or surrounding cities who may have seen a similar object in the summer of 95-98, I&#39;m pretty sure it was within those years but don&#39;t remember exactly when. It was before I got my first computer in late 98, and before playstation took hold in the video gaming community so that should give you a basic esitmate when I saw it. I regret not remembering the exact times and dated when I have these sightings. I know it makes it hard for you guys to make a thourough documentation. As of this night when I have newly found this forum I am going to make better documentation of my sightings. I bought a digital camera for the reason of taking pictures of them. howerver it is a cheap 50$ camera and preforms so poorly in low light conditions I am not going to bother to use it to take pictures of ufo&#39;s, after all since it&#39;s digital there can come the accusation of altering them, and I know some about computer graphics so I could, and since the quality is so poor it could be anything. So to not give myself the reputation of a hoaxer looking for publicity I will not bother to send any pictures. However I could draw pictures, but that&#39;s really no better than my descriptions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am very very interested in looking up sightings from my area of the US in hopes to find someone describing similar sightings. I know that If I see something, there is a good chance someone else did as well. Something is definately going on. Black book experiments, physical extraterrestrials, or demonic desception are all theories I have come acrost in my personal research, and truthfully there is no data that leans the case in one direction or the other. I have not only seen objects in the sky, but a being at my window. I was in fifth grade when that happened so that would make it around 94 or 95. I saw this triangular craft after the window encounter. The odd thing about that is that It was late in the evening before the sun went down and I had been up all night. I had the blinds pulled up, and a bunk bed that raised me perfectly level with the window. As I went to pull down the shades a thought hit me, and I thought something to the tune of. &#34;Why bother? Leave it up. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to actually see anything. and there&#39;s a large bush and tree in front of my window so on one is going to look in on me from the street.&#34; So I was in bed and I had dozed off for a few hours. By the time I woke up it was dark. and I know I wasn&#39;t asleep because I lay there with my eyes open, view of the window blocked my my blankets debating on getting up or going back to sleep. When I finally decided to get up, I saw up and saw it. It was a very odd experience because I only cought a glimps of it for about a second before I threw my head back under my blankets and began praying to every God I could think of to not let something grab me. I had a vertigo almost tunnle vision, where my perriferal vision was blurred, and somewhat blocked, and there was an odd time distortion feeling. I can&#39;t exactly explain it but it seemed like time slowed down in the second I looked at this thing. I later found out from my brother that this which I was describing was known as &#34;the oz factor.&#34; and is quite common. At the time he rea! d more UFO and paranormal books than I did. I wasn&#39;t much of a reader back in those days. What I saw was a pearly white almost luminous though it didn&#39;t appear to be glowing. I could not see the tree of bush behind it, only a inky black void, and it seemed like it and I were all that existed in my sences at the time. I didn&#39;t recieve any telepathic communication, no words in my head. but thinking back on it I didn&#39;t get a hostile feeling from it, only the fear of actually seeing an alien. It had the usual diamond shaped bulbous head, it had no nasil opening, no nose protrustion or mouth. In fact I got the impression that I was looking at some sort of mask because it was very smooth, and almost had a designed look to it. The eyes were a glassy black, but they were not slanted tear drop shaped like you commonly hear described. They were flat on the top and bottom, rounded on the inside edges and wrapped around the sides of the head like sunglasses, or more accurately a dragonfly&#39;s eyes. So I threw my head under my blankets, too scared to move a muscle or make a peep wondering which was worse it being there to take me or there to put me back, and I&#39;m not sure how much time i lay there before I got the courage to take a look to find nothing was amiss. Needless to say I got the hell out of that room pronto, and stayed up all night clutching a butcher knife.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I must say that it was that event that sparked a great deal of my curiosity. I had known about UFO&#39;s before and seen strange lights, but never an encounter so up close and personal with something that I could not explain away as a shooting star, or satelight, or unidentified form of uncommon airplane, not exactly one that is top secret but one uncommon enough to not be identified as an airplane. Now I have nightmares, and have had all my life, some of them of UFO themes, but I do not notice any missing time, or have any screen memories or abduction memories, so either I am not an abductee, or I don&#39;t remember the events. I would like the first of the two to be true. I know this is a rather lingthy post describing the two most undeniable encounters I have had with unknown beings. I have not seen any odd lights since at least 2000, and I have never before or since seen an actual alien being. I do have a 3d rendering of what I saw, which I don&#39;t even like to look at because of how well I reproduced what I remember seeing. It still scares me to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Someone please tell me where I can locate others who are sincere about their experiences where I can relate and recieve stories and compaire and contrast. Something is going on, and it&#39;s only a matter of time before we find out what it is.<n>

It had a sound of that which if you took a very large electromagnet and applied a considerable amount of current to it(a sort of a deep humming sound with a pulse in it).  We saw that the craft just seemed to be passing by going north then changed direction to northwest.  The sky was clear with some clouds and some stars.  The color of the craft seemed to be a metallic bluish black surface.  Again, the lights were very bright and brilliant, alot brighter than any aircraft I&#39;ve seen.<n>

I was only ten years old, but I&#39;ll never forget anything about the night. It was probably one of the clearest nights, and the moon was either full, or close to it. I was playing with my friends, just goofing off, and I jumped in a circle. When I turned I saw something in the sky that, kind of resembled a smaller moon. It was just below and to the right of where the moon was positioned, and it was really close to our houses. I stopped jumping and watched it; I could feel that everyone was still jumping. I didn’t even think to get their attention, because I didn’t want to look away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a huge sphere in the sky, about the same color of the moon, but completely smooth. As I continued to watch it, it dipped down, came up again, dipped behind the top of the trees, came up again, and then finally disappeared behind the trees. It never made a sound. I watched to see if it would come up again, but it didn’t. From my point of view, it looked like it had landed in the softball field behind my friend’s house; that friend was jumping on the trampoline with me at that moment. I turned around quickly to tell everyone what I had seen, when one of my other friends said, &#34;Did you see that?!&#34;  Everyone stopped to listen to what we both saw, but none of them had seen it but us. I think about it now, and I’m so glad I wasn’t the only one to see it, because I would feel crazy. We still talk about it from time to time, I think, just to make sure we did both see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was looking across our small valley at the hills to the north.  My wife was inside, in the back bedroom.  Off in the distance, from the south, I first heard what sounded like faint rolling thunder.  This noise became increasing louder, gradually subsided and ceased altogether when the object came into view directly over my head.  My house abuts the hills directly behind.  I estimate the hills to be approx 200-250ft. high...This SAND colored triangle, flying in a NW direction was emitting a faint high-pitched &#34;hissing&#34; noise and moving slowly, (approx. 75-100mph.).  Because of it&#39;s low altitude and my physical position in relation to the craft, I was only able to observe the under-carriage.  I observed only two blinking lights, (non strobe), - round white light on left side and round red light on right side.  From my perspective they appeared to be the size of a basketball.  I estimate the width of the craft, (at it&#39;s widest point), to be around 100ft.  My guess as to it&#39;s length would be the same.  There was nothing, other than the lights, distinguishable on the under-side; no indication of landing gear, portals or even seams.  I viewed the craft for about 30 secs., until it passed from view over the next ridge, to the north.  The ground shook, as well as the house&#39;s foundation, which alerted my wife who came out only in time to see the craft starting to disappear over the horizon.  Once I regrouped, my first reaction was that if must have been a &#34;stealth fighter&#34; - we live about 60mi. NW of White Sands Missle range and are in the vicinity of two other major military installations.  I&#39;ve only seen a few pictures of stealths and quite frankly don&#39;t remember too many details of same.  I&#39;m not what you would call a military &#34;high-tech groupie&#34;.  The military industrial complex is mostly repulsive, rather! than in triguing to me.  I&#39;ve mentioned this sighting to a couple of ex-military types, who insist that it was not a stealth. I am a Vietnam &#34;Illegal Police Action&#34; veteran.  My background is communcations/marketing, with a degree in Radio and Television Production.  My wife attended college, raised two children and is now busy building a jewelry business.  Our children are grown and pursuing interests/careers.  I jokingly tell my friends that I came to New Mexico, (seven years ago), to &#34;see a UFO&#34;.  I&#39;ve believe I&#39;ve seen my first.  Hopefully, more to come!<n>

They were traveling in a capsuale sitting vertical position as they moved from east to west. They evetually disappeared into the western horizon. Nothing Real dramatic in there apperance or movement other than they were moving very fast, and they were defintely not airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First I saw one capsuale shaped object. It was silver color, like when the sun shines on an airplane. It was traveling from east to west. What really caught my attention was that this capsuale shaped object was traveling east to west with this capsuale shape positioned verticle. I was walking to my vehicle where my friend was waiting, still watching as I walked to my vehicle. My friend and I proceeded to watch and have a discussion about this object, and the possibilities of what it might be when I got in my vehicle. Meanwhile it had traveled closer to the horizon. Suddenly there where two more of same objects that are eyes had now been drawn too. They were almost at the edege of the horizon. They were traveling even with each other side by side. They were also traveling east to west like the first one. Which was sitll traveling in same direction towards the other 2 in the western horizin. They were all traveling very fast .What we both saw next Immediately Eliminated alot of the possibilities of what we thought these objects might be. It was another capsuale shaped object dropping straight down into our atmosphere. The reason I can say this with confidence is that it was sparking, and it was red hot in color. It appeared to then just stop moveing momentarilly. It cooled quickly as I saw it change color from this red hot look to the silver color like the other three. Once it changed to this silver color it started moving east to west in same direction as the other 3 objects. Same speed very fast in a straight east to west direction. We watched them all move straight from the east into the western horizon untill we lost site of all four as they dissapeared into horizin. I am a Tool and die maker. My friend is a printer. Im still currious as to what they might have been. They where definitely not airplanes.<n>

At or near the point where the flight paths met, the light turned 90 degrees to left very sharply and accelerated upward and disappeared from sight. This  sharpness of turn and the sudden increase in speed proved that it was not any thing man could duplicate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We saw it and then, instantly it appeared in a different part of the sky.  We pulled into a deserted parking lot and watched it for three minutes or so, just dissapearing and reappearing in different parts of the sky.  It was a diamond shape but flat on the top and bottom, almost like a stop sign.  It was really wierd to see and we hopped back in the car and headed home quick.  We could still see it in the sky, but when we got home, it was gone, like it knew we were going to try to show someone at the house.  That was the last we ever saw of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  The date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

Once I walked to a position from which I could see, I looked up and witnessed what seemed to look like an extremely bright and reflective (clear sky) crystal ball hanging in the sky. It appeared to be about 5 miles to the south and about a mile in attitude. It&#39;s size was about 1/4 the size of a full moon. It stayed perfectly still for about 20 minutes, during which time the other observers became bored and left. I stayed. The object slowly began elongating and growing in size on the elongated end, somewhat like a condensed baseball bat (without the knob on the end). The object lost it&#39;s highly reflective appearance and seemed to be silvery metallic. It slowly began moving away in a southwest direction and up. It kept moving away in that direction, quite slowly, until it was too small to see. I would (probably highly inaccurately) estimate its largest size at up to 500&#39; from end to end, 50&#39; across on the spherical end, and 100&#39; across and the elongated end.<n>

I was in downtown Toronto, when I turned and began to walk between 2 buildings.  One of theses was the Huge &#34;gold&#34; Royal Bank building.  Between these buildings was not an alley, but more like a very large garden atry, quite a nice public area.  While I was walking along I decided to look up, for the bank building is tall and its interesting to look upwards when standing next to tall buildings. It can give you a funny feeling. Anyway, I looked up without breaking my stride.  I saw just hovering between the building s but a bit higher then the bank building was a grey saucerlike craft.  There were no markings or lights that I could see.  it seemed grey-metallic, but there was no shiny reflections, more like a dull matte finished surface.  WHile I looked at it my mind didn&#39;t seem to register what I was seeing.  I returned my eyes down for I suddenly realized that I wasn&#39;t seeing where I was going.  This was for about 6 seconds.  After about 5 seconds of only looking where I was going my brain kicked in and I looked back up.  The craft sat there for another second and the acended upwards and out of sight within 3 seconds or less. This was mid-afternoon.<n>

I went outside and they pointed south-east and I say an object appoximately 3/4 to 1 mile away, stationary and about less than a 1000 ft up.  I told the kids I don&#39;t now what it is, but I continued to observe it.  I noticed that it was rotating because the sun was glinting off it despite the clouds in the sky.  As I watched it I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing, another object this one round looked like a metallic ball, decended from the bottom of the stationary object.  The size of this object was one tenth the size of the other.  The round object then procceded to fly in our direction (west), staying at the same altitude. The speed was incrediably high, I cranned my neck to keep my sight on the object, I watched it fly overhead until it disappeared over the trees behind us, this took only a few seconds and it was gone.  I then watched the original object for a few seconds more, the it slowly moved in a northern direction dissapearing into the clouds.  Still trying to located it, I then noticed two fighter jets, I couldn&#39;t see the markings.  The jets were flying at a high rate of speed, chasing the object. I watched them till they disapeared into the clouds also.  My children asked me, &#34;what was that thing&#34;, my respose was &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;.  I went in and told my wife this same incredable story, and have not forgot the details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I tell anyone who listen, They always ask was it a flying saucer, my response is always the same, &#34;I don&#39;t know what it was&#34;  I have always been a non beleiver in &#34;flying Suacers&#34; and I am still a non believer today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was sitting on the left,east,side of the vehicle.  A extreemly bright light caught my eye from the rear window of the vehicle it descended from the North side of Witchita Ka. above 20,000ft. leveled off about 1-2K feet above the ground headed directly towards Welington Ka. AS it flashed by the car on the west side my wife saw it also.  It continued in a straight line with the exception of one very little jump up and back down, maybe 500ft, untill it approach my visual horizon then it shot straight up out of sight.  This entire display laster less than 8 sec. The outline of the craft was hidden behind the brilliant light,  it did not light up the area as it travelled above the ground, as a bright conventional light would do.  No sound was hear, conventional aircraft moving at that speed and altitude would have a signature boom.  The speed would have been in the Moc 12.00 range. The object did not change color as it went verticle, It did not repeat.<n>

It was a clear sky with very little light polution and a lot of stars.  I looked at a particular patch of stars and noticed an object with the same shape and brightness as a star.  The object was definately on the outside of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. We suspected that the object/craft was performing manuevers because it would travel in a straight line, the take hard, right angled turns to the right or left.  On occassion, it would travel in partial circular motions and, again take hard, right angled turns.  There was no way of determining the exact speed, but the fact that it was outside the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and we could notice substantial movement, we could only conclude that it was traveling at an incredible velocity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In retrospect, I should&#39;ve tracked it for as long as I could, but got bored and went on to other things.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

After we was finished I was laying on the recliner outside and watching for shooting stars. When I saw What i thought was a satelite. Then another and another and more followed. They were crossing right in front of each other. I dont figure they was at the samed altitude. Or there would have been some very close calls. Anyways, they all just kind of parted and went there own seperate ways. Then I said &#34;Look, Look at those three stars,&#34; which I knew they wasnt stars it was just the only thing I could think at the time. They flew right through where the other objects had just been. It was moving from North to South.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then we saw them the very next night. They was moving East to West. Still a perfect triangle moving the same speed across the sky but this past summer I have seen them again and they was not a perfect triangle. Instead it had a extra light and one of the others was not shining I will mail you a picture of what I mean. All together sense the first time I saw these lights, I have probably seen them 5 times. The past three has been a different shape but in a broken up triangular form. If that makes any sense to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from same witness, different dates.

At first I thought it might just be lites in the distance untill I saw the colors changing and rotating.&#34;I got chills BIG time&#34; but when we continuded down the road about a 1/2 mile to a mile I saw the same thing AGAIN! I told my wife and she thought I was nuts but I think our youngest boy saw it also.I can&#39;t get the image out of my head. I was watching Sighting tonight(7/25/99) when I saw the part where the police in some town out south were chasing a UFO and then saw 3 of them. They wre the same ones I saw 2 years ago in N.J. So I know I&#39;m not crazy.    I&#39;ve always believed in UFO&#39;s. Why would we be the only life forms in the universe? Whene Iwas younger(about 7,8 or 9years old) I witnessed many UFO&#39;s .I lived on a farm in Westford Ma. When A friend and I saw Multable white objects in the sky. They were oval in shape and they would stay together. They would move slowly at first but then in a shot would disapear. I&#39;ve seen others from time to time sin ce then but nothing like what I saw the night of 7/-/97. I&#39;ll never forget that night. The chills still run up and down my back when I think about it. I&#39;ve alway been a believer in the unnown.

After learning to track the moon as it moved rapidly across my field I started focusing on the surface.  I used the craters as the reference as where to focus.  After looking at the area on the periphery of the lighted portion of the moon (I used this because it seemed easier to actually see terrain distinctly and in focus).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately I noticed an object traveling North by North East (upper right direction as my vision would orientate.  It traveled in a precisely straight line for close to one minute.  During this time I tried to determine if this was a just a surface phenomenon or something on my lens.  I quickly determined that it had to be on the surface as it did not appear until I had complete focus on the surface craters and features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I had established that fact, and continued following the object it stopped for a few seconds (I mention this only because it was a distinct period however short).  It then turned left (almost) 90 degrees to the left and traveled for another 5-10 seconds before stopping.  It remained at that position for well over a minute or so.  I followed it until the moon disappeared behind the trees and the house I lived in - Mountains of Colorado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried again in the back of the house (to bypass the blockage that the house and trees had presented) but was unable to establish exactly what or where the spot was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My observation was that the shadow did not elongate as a shadow would if it were to rise and fall on the landscape (because it was on the rising or setting light source).  It remained in clear focus during the entire time and also remained as a spot and did not become an elongated feature or blurred image.<n>

After closer observation we realized it had a definate shape, ability to change direction and altitude at will, and was indescribable in any common description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were sitting in the hot tub on the roof of our 26 floor condominium building in downtown Salt Lake City.  From this location there is a complete view of the Salt Lake valley.  I had noticed a small fire burning several miles to the west of the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly thereafter, as I was looking to the south from our location,  I noticed what appeared to be a small cloud of smoke floating from west to east and about 3 blocks to the south at the same level as our position.  Initially I assumed it to be from the fire I had noticed earlier, until I realize the wind direction was the opposite of the direction of travel of what I assumed was smoke and also the fire was too small and too distant for the smoke to remain together for that distance.  I immediately directed my wifes attention to what I was witnessing, and we watched in total amazement for several minutes as the object navigated within an approximate 2 mile area.  The only way to describe the object is through relating it to other known objects.  When we first started observing it, the object seemed to be just an undulating mass, but as we watched it, we realized that it did in fact have a shape that remained consistent throughout the entire episode.  This shape and movement would relate perfectly to movies we have seen of large stingrays as they move through the water with their outstretched fins waving, similar to birds wings in slow motion  The strangest part of the episode was that the object was almost entirely invisible, and the only recognition that it was even there was that it distorted everything behind it so that you could in fact make out the shape by observing these distortions.  Again, to relate it to something familiar, it resembled the creature in the movie &#34;The Predator&#34;.  As we watched the object, it navigated in a very definate path, changing directions at will and traveling first from west to east, then to the south, then back to the west, then lowering in altitude close to a baseball stadium about a mile from our location,! then hovering at that spot for several minutes, then again rising in altitude and moving back to the west at a phenomonal speed until it totally disappeared.  This was all done with total disregard to wind speed or direction, which ruled out the cloud theory or the fact that it could be caused by a pocket of hot air which could have caused a mirage affect.  After it&#39;s disappearance, my wife and I remained stunned for several minutes just watching for it&#39;s return.  We then tryed to figure out what we had seen, since neither of us had said anything while we were watching it. Our descriptions to eachother afterwards confirmed that we had both seen the exact same phenomena and that it was nothing we had ever witnessed before or probably would ever again.  One of the things that we did realize was that it was our location that had made it possible to see it in the first place.  Had someone on the ground tryed to see it they  would not have been able to do so since it was only the distortions of the background objects that even made it possible to distinguish, and looking up against a blue sky would have made that impossible.  Whatever it was, I know it was not a heat distortion, or a cloud and that it was definately under some sort of guidance or control.  This event was very special to me since I have always been a believer in the possibility of many activities beyond our comprehension, but my wife has always thought that to be a rather ludicrous idea, until this event, which she still cannot explain or justify.<n>

As I looked up I happen to notice a airplane then my eyes looked a little lower and I seen another airplane nothing out of the ordinary.  Furthermore, as I looked at the second airplane my eyes focused on a object that was in the air with no movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing I did was stop everyone from talking and get them to look at the object in the air.  I noticed there was nothing attached to it and it was like it was observing the college campus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My peers all notice the object and I think it noticed us because it started to move. The object was oval and it moved very slowly on the left of the object was a green light flashing from side to side then on the right side was orange light flashing from side to side it was sunny and clear as day outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was a good distance away but it was so clear outside with no buildings blocking our view we could all see the object in clear view. Then the object moved so fast it just disappeared before our eyes. I have never seen anything like that in my life and I just wanted to share my experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

ANYWAY IT SO BRIGHT AND NOT MAKING ANY NOISE I RAN INTO THE HOUSE AND GOT THE BINOCULARS AND WAS ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE LIGHT AND SAW IT HAD 3 SMALLER LIGHTS BEHIND IT. TWO SMALL WHITE ONES AND A SINGLE BLUISH-GREEN ONE.. NO RED OR STROBE LIGHTS LIKE AIRCRAFT THAT FLY OVER ALL THE TIME. MY FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS A SATELLITE AS IT WAS MOVING SO FAST AND QUIET BUT IT WAS NOT HIGH ENOUGH AND WAS TOO BRIGHT. IT WAS ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS THE EVENING STAR...I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES AND IT WAS STILL BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE IT WITH THE NAKED EYE.. I MADE THE COMMENT TO MYSELF, AS IT WAS ABOUT GONE FROM SIGHT, &#34;IT MUST BE OVER EUGENE BY NOW&#34; NOTE, EUGENE IS ABOUT 72 MILES SOUTH OF SALEM.<n>

I saw this star comming towards me and then it came to a hover a few hundred meters above my back garden. It was then i realised this was a powered craft as it then started to move west over my neighbours house. No noise came from it as the ufo moved then stoped again. I was frozen to the spot as i was in ore of this object, a bright silver ball just haging above me. I then rememberd my camcorder was in the house so i went in and grabed it. I rushed out , it was still there. I started filming and have about 20 mins of tape. I recorded it untill my battery ran out and then carried on watching the ufo as it hovered around our houses and came to rest at the front of my house above some trees. It stayed there for a few minutes and then shot off upwards and out of sight very quickley. It was such a fantastic experence that will be with me for the rest of my life. I would like your opinon on what i have recorded. A few people have seen the video but no one has come up with an answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to review the video.

As I walk past the patio door I look out and saw a inverted triangle of soft golden white light. It was moving at about 60-70mph north along the flight path for Reno Cannon International Airport. At first I thought It was a planes landing lights, but I saw No blinking transponder! I stepped out side and the city was unusually quite. I listened and could hear no engine or jet noise! That is when I knew it was no plane! The flight path Is about 3 miles from my house and I can hear every plane that lands or takes off, and I have watched hundereds of planes take off and land in the 33 years I have lived here. I watched it move from just over the Reno Hilton Hotel, which is about 4-5 miles south west of my house, untill It was just over the dark line of my neighbors house due west off me when it just blinked off! At that distance I would estimate the size to be about 100 by 100 ft. The sides of the triangel were equal and the golden white light was soft enough that the glow did not distort the shape of the object. It was flying level at about a thousand ft. I own a dental laboratory and am use to paying attention to small details. It had travelled about 5 miles from the time I sppotted it untill it vanished about 90 sec. later. It travelled slow and level, it did not turn, pulsate or do any thing unusual except blink off with out even saying goodby. I thought that was very rude. They have the nerve to fly over, get people all excited then leave with out so much as even a thank you.<n>

I stopped my vehicle and tried to understand what it was. As I watched, it began to change shapes, and flash as if the entire unit was a strobe light. I am a former member of the Civil Air Patrol (1Lt.) and I am very familiar with small aircraft, and this was unlike anything I have ever seen. The craft seemed to be observing the construction of the communications tower. Traffic began to build behind me and I had to move to another location 20 seconds away, however, after I moved it was gone. No aircraft I have ever seen from this elevated view point can move out of the field of view so quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Allison Park in Hampton Twp., about 12 miles North of the city of Pittsburgh PA. On Friday July 11 1997, I was on my way home at 3:25 PM. I entered the northern end of Topnic Dr.(in Hampton Twp) and from its high elevation I looked to see how much progress was made on the new communications tower being built near the township Municipal building and as I made the turn onto Topnic I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. Looking due south, I saw the tower first. It was not far from being topped off. I could barely see the men working on the top section, but just off to the right, or to the west, there was a black object hovering, as if observing the tower. It was about 1500 above the ground and about 1/2 mile away from me and was so black it was if I was looking at a hole in the sky. It was sort of barrel shaped, and as I watched it hovering completly silent and motionless, it began to change shapes. It changed so many times that I could no longer tell what shape it wa! s. It then began to flash as if the entire craft was a strobe light, pulsing about every 2 seconds. I could see no detail in the craft, no lights or windows, just a black object in the sky hovering silently motionless at first, and then suddenly changing shapes, and flashing like a giant strobe light. I am a mature adult man, with years of experience in the USAF Civil Air Patrol. I live within the TCA of Pittsburgh International Airport, and I&#39;m used to seeing aircraft of military, commercial, and private origin flying in the area. I have never in my life, however, seen anything that I can even say comes close to looking like the craft that I saw on 11 July 1997. My vehicle was stopped in the middle of the road as I observed this craft, and a few cars started to build up behind me. I moved on down the road where I lost sight of it for 20 seconds. When I got to another vantage point, it was gone. From the elevation that I was at, no aircraft, balloon, or helicopter could have moved out of my field of view so quickly. I never heard of any other witnesses, but would like to know, if anybody out there can tell me, if there were any other reports of this sighting. I didn&#39;t report this to anyone, because I didn&#39;t know who to report it to.<n>

A friend of my father is owner of a big, big farm far of the city, placed in a region called &#34;vergel de la sierra&#34;, this farm still virgin, only a little house in the middle. This house used to be keeped by an old guy called ((name deleted)) he was very humble. The curious thing its that since my father was a child he used to go there with &#34;Tito&#34; the actual owner of the farm. Several sightings of strange things have happened in the farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my father was a child, in the middlenight, a big &#34;cigarrete&#34; shape flying ship, with a powerful light stayed for at least 5 minutes over the little house. Tito and he where very scared, since my father was turning on the water boiler outside of the little house. It appeared from nothing and maked a big continuous noise. &#34;I maked a big jump to the closer window&#34; tells my father.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another sighting aprox in 1995 was made by Chon (Chon already died, his son seen it and lives, he told us this was one of several other same sightings). Since we saw Chon, with half of body burned, when we were camping in farm, we asked wath happened. Chon said us it was common to see this &#34;bright light&#34; over a little lagoon but because of fear, he never get closer to it. But, one day he got closer by curiosity and the thing emitted a big flash of heat and light and went off. &#34;This thing came to steal water&#34; he said. I believed Chon, since he was a person who even dont know how to write or read, far of comunication and contaminating ideas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was esceptic to see weird things, until 1998 when my father, a cousin, a friend and me, where on camping on the farm. We where sitting over a very hig cliff, watching the eagles flying over us. We where keeping a camera with us, waiting for an eagle to get closer. Suddenly a black object apperaed with the eagles and in half a second descended tremendously fast &#34;vertically&#34; at our left (i remember it was like 30 meters far of us), its size was like four cars. Nor a small noise was made by the ship. It flyed very close to us, and passed from left to right like for about 6 seconds, until it was lost of sight because some threes. We tryed to follow it, but the fear was too big, so we decide to go as fast as we could to the camping and jeep. We couldnt photo the thing, but 4 people watched it. I remember it clearly, (at the bottom i guess) black triangle, flat, with some texture like lines. Four fire or light hemispheres attached to every end and one at the center.Ive sended a raw image in other mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two cousins where chased at night in &#34;Vergel de la Sierra&#34; by a lightened flying &#34;hamburger&#34;, on a night scout patrol, if you want more details they could mail you. Actually they dont like to talk about that, they still have a bad remember. They left even the tents and things there, they dont get back there anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are many things ive seen and read that tell me there is some real thing concerning to people, investors, government and many others. I hope my testimony to arrive to the correct hands, someone who is really interested in my sightings. Here in vergel strange things are happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

The levelore blinds were closed, but it didnt seem to matter. The walk-in closet was bright green, as was the bathroom.  My bedroom door was open, and the hallway was pitch black. My boyfriend was asleep next to me, and I tried like hell to wake him up..but he wouldnt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked around the room, I thought I was going to see little grey men. There was no noise whatsoever. Since my boyfriend wouldnt wake up I had this feeling something was going to happen, so I got up really quick and ran down the hallway.  I rounded the corner to the living room, and glanced at the clock. I had heard of missing time and wanted to document it in my mind. The living room was dark as it should be.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I grabbed the doorknob to the deck, I knew the green light in the bedroom quit.  There was never any noise, and Im not sure how I knew that light was gone.   I looked back at the clock and it had only been a few minutes..so I wasnt missing any time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back down the hallway and stood in the bedroom doorway, and said my boyfriends name. He sat up and said &#34; What.&#34;  He is a very light sleeper, and it doesnt take him much to wake up. I told him what happened and he thought there was someone in the house.  I explained to him about the green glow, and that I tried to wake him up.  He had bruising on his shoulder as a result of me shaking him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the morning I phoned the manager of the apartments and the Sheriff.  A deputy came out and took a report.  We determined that there is no way a beam of green light came from the apartment building in front of us that would be strong enough to not only penetrate the blinds, but light up the closet and the bathroom with no noise, nor would anyone know I was enroute to the living room to open the door to the deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very frightening night for me, and not one I will ever forget.  I was amazed however that the Sheriff&#39;s deputy actually took me seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

St. between Antioch and Pflumm, I Noticed to my left a trio of lights which were strobing.  The lights were in a diamond shape, two ruby red lights at the upper two corners, and a brilliant white at the lower point.  The white light would pulse twice, then dim, and then the red lights would pulse and then dim.  The object was travelling from the southeast to the northwest.  My vehicle was travelling about 45 m.p.h. and after watching the object for about two minutes it passed over the road just in front of me continueing its course.  This was not a plane.  I observed no green marker lights.<n>

It was dark, and was arround 22h00.  The sky was slightly cloudy, when suddenly we saw a Triangular ( Rather &#34;Boomerang&#34; style ) formed flying object, that was luminiscent,  ( Not full Triangular, but from tip to two sides, that&#39;s why the description is &#34;Boomerang&#34; ), moving from East to West a great speed, at a considerable height, at least to our impression.  It just took a mather of seconds, but we both were sure it was something we had never seen before, and the brightness of the object, in distinctive form, made us sure, we did&#39;n imagine, or were seeing something, that was just a product of imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I report this now, since then, we joked abt it, but by now, I am convinced we might have witnessed something, considering the surfacing evidence of the last decades.<n>

These orbs seemed to mimic the witnesses’ movements and emit an overwhelming sense of fear or terror into those that got too close. Mechanical sounds, such as the hum from transformer or generator could be heard nearby but never be located.  A spotlight was seen overhead shining down as if searching for something.  The source of light seemed to come from a craft that was invisible to the eye and silent to the ear.  Yet its presence was evident due to the disturbance in the tree tops created by its exhaust or propulsion system.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day two witnesses returned to further investigate and claimed to encounter the same overwhelming sense of fear but this time they were suddenly surrounded by hundreds of black birds filling the trees all around them.  Their attention was directed into the center of the forest about 20 yards away where the black birds’ seemed to be focused.  There they saw an Un-humanoid figure laying face up, being pecked at by these birds.  The body was described as being small and frail with an over sized head and black almond shaped eyes. Its color seemed to be a cross between peach, gray and purple.  The  witnesses wanted to get closer for a better look, however, the fear became too overwhelming and forced them to retreat far away, back to the house a 1/4 mile away.  They were unable to look back the entire hike back, they felt a presence that seemed to be following them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An hour later the two returned with several friends to the area expecting to, at the least find the remains of a deer or something.  But nothing was there. No deer, no birds, no alien body, nothing, not even the fear.  If you look about one hundred yards east of the forest, in the orchard, you see an impact crater/burn mark still visible.  Also, one of the witnesses claims to have had several more close encounters with the same beings in what is described as being similar to a lucid dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/7/97 20:45|Las Cruces|NM|Changing|30 minutes|It was never anything I have seen before.|10/12/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19826.html|115|ndxe199707| It was never anything I have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon leaving work I was heading home.  On the horseshoe of Nike Ave. I saw against the mountains ( north of the  artillary range area) what looked like fire.  The year before we had fires in the same area and this caught my eye.  But this orange ball of fire moved  from upper part of the mountains downward onto the White Sands Missle Range where I work.  This ball then moved horizontally northward and then eastward in my direction.  I was driving westward towards the object.   The horeshoe is just a curve in the road on Nike Ave.  and after the curve it is a straight road for about 9-10 miles.  As I drove towards the objest ( about 5 miles ) it also came towards me. It traveled about total 8-10  miles (not sure this distance) from mountain top to middle of the missle range where I stopped my car midway down Nike Ave.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object in its travel changed color from fire orange and circular to a luminous white.  It was about  a block away in the desert.  It looked like a huge lightbulb desending from a height of about  30 feet  to where I thought it might touch down on the ground but it did not.  It kicked up a little desert dust for only a second then huvered in one spot about 10 feet off the ground.  It did not wobble or drift in any direction from the first time I obsevved it to the time I later lost site of it.  It traveled like it was programmed to follow a digital course or never made any course corrections as it moved.  I figure it took about less than 5 minutes to travel from the mountain top to the middle of the road or the 8 mile trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I stopped my car on the road I stopped delibertly  to have my headlights facing the thing.  It did not land but stopped and did not move in any direction.  It just stayed put and it did not rotate or pitch.  It looked like a lightbulb about 6 feet across and about 10 feet tall.  glass end up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> it had a dark socket underneith....just like a litebulb.   I thought it might be a hot air balloon but it was incondesently bright.  If people were in it they would have to be in the glass section the bottom socket section was too small.  There was no ropes between sections.  The two sections were connected directlly together.  I then saw the thing turn its light off and I told myself don&#39;t blink and watch to see if this thing would turn on again.  I was thinking if it was a hot airballoon I would see the delay of small fire ignition to maximum turn on of full throttle propane burn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I did not blink and I thought I could see beyond the thing (like it became transparent for a second)  then it turn to full brillancy instantly (like you turn on a lightbulb).  There was no flutter of flame as a hot airballoon does and the thing never changed altitude.  I thought  that if anyone was in the thing they would have had there night vision obsured for the high intensity of the light that came from within.  I couldn&#39;t see anything inside if it even had a inside.  All I saw was a giant lightbulb flying in the air.  Next I decided to flash my headlights on and off to see if anything would happened.  At that point the thing started back the same way it had came back the exact course traveled before up to the mountain top.  As it was heading back I followed down the road in its direction but it was faster than my car.  Then it went over the mountain top and I lost site of it for a few moments.  About 10 minutes later it came over another mountain top and it looked like two car lights coming over the mountain top (above the mountain).  Each light came north together then flew away from each other (one east and the other west like synchonized swimming and then flew back to the mountain to be lost from site.  I also absorved a flashing red lite that looked like the light on a helicopter above the mountain right where the two lights flew.   Also this object didn&#39;t make any sound as it travel or stopped in the air.  When the object first came down along the mountain it lit up the mountain with its orange glow.  If this was balloonist they were flying in an are forbidden to fly (White Sands Missle Range artillary range) and they would be flying over very trecherous and dangerous mountain at night.  When the object flew back over the mountain it remained luminous white.   I don&#39;t know if it turned into two headlight at the end of the trip but these two lights were alot smaller in size and the flashing red light would be a third light .  All three lites were three seperate units.  The red lite stayed motionless over the mountain top while the white lites were moving in two different directions to each other.  All three came to the same are on the far side of the mountain and that is where I could not see them anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was the one day in my life I wish I has had a camera.

I was leaving work and heading west down Nike Ave.  I had just reached the horse shoe curve at Launch Complex-32 .  In the distant mountains, just north of the artillery range, in the smallest portion of the mountain range, I thought I saw a orange ball of fire burning two- thirds  the  way up the  mountain side.  There were fires in that same place the year before.  The smoke of those fires  invaded Main Post.  The diameter of the object was about 1/4 to 1/5 the height of the mountain. As I continued to drive west on Nike Ave. I notice that this was not a fire				 but something that was fiery orange and was floating down the mountain.				 When the object was about half way down it headed north towards Main Post.				 I continued to drive west on Nike Ave towards Main Post.				 The object then changed from orange to a luminous white. 				 The object then headed in my direction and stopped half way down Nike Ave.				 It stayed lit or luminated all the way from the mountain to the halfway point of Nike Ave.				 The light intensity stayed the same too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started to descend and I thought it was going to land  but it did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came within about 15 feet of the ground and I waiting to see sand kick up around it but there was none.  It was the size of a VW beetle shaped like a ordinary light bulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object just stopped in mid-air and didn&#39;t float around or wobble  but stayed in one place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any other known aircraft would wobble a little to compensate for air currents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It wasn&#39;t a helicopter because it was so close you would have heard the helicopter&#39;s motor.  There was no sound.  You can hear a helicopter a mile away and this object was less than a block away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was so luminous that it was like looking right into a light bulb at night and seeing nothing but the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If someone was inside the object they would be blinded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped my car and set my headlights in it&#39;s direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw the light turn off. (The light being the object).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I said to myself if this is a hot-air balloon then when it relites it should flicker before it glows in full intensity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen balloons at night like at the Night Glow Festival and they all flicker when the propane burners turn on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then said to myself &#34; don&#39;t blink my eyes or I might miss the relighting and miss the glimpse of flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not blink and the object did not flicker but came back to full intensity instantly like turning on a light bulb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought if there was any intelligence on board this thing it might understand mathematics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my headlights off and then blinked the headlights once, twice, and three times, then twice, then once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This would show addition and subtraction in its simplest form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the object started to move in the direction from which it came.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It followed the same flight path back the same way it had came.  As though it was following a programmed flight course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started my car and continued to drive west on Nike Ave.  Keeping an eye on it until it went over the mountain.  It got to the mountain before I got to the end of Nike Ave. which tells me this thing was not a balloon but flew under quite some power because it traveled an estimated distance of 8 miles in about 8 minutes and that works out to be about 60 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From that point on I headed home going north on Owen Road which leads to Highway 70.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I cloverleafed around to get on highway 70, I was now facing south and looking at the mountains where the object flew over.  I could see two bright lights coming over the mountain and they were together.  It looked like headlights of a car flying over the mountain heading north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights, flying parallel to each other, split apart, one going west and the other going East and both turned back to the mountain they just came over to go back over it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also observed a red blinking light setting over the mountain where these two white lights were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then all three lights moved back behind the mountain and I didn&#39;t see nothing after that.  I proceeded to continue on my way back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After many years of pondering this incident I don&#39;t believe it to have been a balloon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because people flying in a balloon so close at night in the mountains would be very dangerous.  And this object flew a long distance in a short time which means the balloon would have to have a motor to move it so fast.   But I don&#39;t know what it was I cannot leave out the possibly it could have been a balloon.  I have another idea it could have been a light source like a laser facility shinning a light against the mountain and then pointing the light down Nike Ave.  But when I saw the light at such close distance to me the object looked like a solid object.   I don&#39;t know to this day what I saw.<n>

Two other craft in the vicinity were behaving the same way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We assume to this day that it was military experimental craft.  My dad is convinced that they were airplanes, and that&#39;s how my brother and I interpreted the craft at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking back, perhaps we processed these as airplanes only because we had no other exemplar to choose from.  I&#39;d say that the craft were definitely the size of military airplanes, and they moved at a similar speed as airplanes, but I can&#39;t say that I know that they had wings like an airplane.  I assume they did have wings, only because we didn&#39;t make a mental note that they looked any different than airplanes.  The crafts were unlike average airplanes in that they seemed to communicate with each other in a unique way, spitting out these pillars of smoke and then randomly following them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember their formation as this was 10 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The bl./grn. translusant type color filled area betwn. ea. light. Low hum s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until that July, none of us had ever seen a Flying Object that was Unidentifiable.   We have been camping together for many years now, so with all the latenight fireside chats the need to Identify has occured. It was around 1:30 am when I first noticed a odd lingering greenish light moving SLOWLY over the treed hills. At first I thought It was smoke from fireworks, BUT when in full veiw the shape was too triangularly defined. I asked for an opinion and recieved confirmation that it was MORE! The last log was burning low enouph and approaching closer a STARTLING sight it was. Then my husband had to shine a bright flashlight at it and within 5 mins. It made a very clear change in direction OUR WAY. It reached the lake that we camp on and I began to PANIC, It was HUGE!!! (3\4 or more the size of a football field) Uncontrollably shaking with tears in my eyes I went for witnesses. when we got back to the lake it was nearly over us. It had three lights, one on each corner the front light was the brightest. The area between each point was a translucent greenish\blue color. It made a strange two tone subsonic type low hummmmmminggg sound. Heading N.West it moved rythmaticly with a soft up\down appearance at the frant of it. I was SOOO scared, all in total AWE we had to sit. At about 3:00 am it was over the sand dunes, but thankfully past us. Allthough still in uor sights everyone was very tired and wanted to retire for the night. I could not take my eyes off of it, I watched it from our moterhome window. At around a 3:45/4:00 am it dissappeared with a sheetlightning or Giant camera FLASH. On our way home we stopped by a favorate place to dine in a nearby town Mapleton OR. we noticed that the paper mentioned it. When we returned from our vacation, We reported our &#34;sighting&#34; to the Unsolved Mysteries &amp; Sightings Websites. This was in 1997 and I cant seem to get it off of my mind. If anyone else has seen or heard simular reports. PLEASE POST IT!!! Sometimes I feel so alone in the effect it had on me. In ways I w! ish that I could pass it off as a Military thing as I have other pacullar flying crafts, but I DONT BELIVE THAT! As far as our personal backgrounds... My husband I own two businesses, I manage both of them, My spouse is a ((deleted)) Training Tech. for the State of Oregon, others hold professional positions.

We were alone at the road and when we stopped to verify it stopped too. It was not a helicopter &#39;cause there were no sound at all and it mooved almost 25 km. so it wasn&#39;t a light comming from the ground neither.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were 4 people comming from a practice session with our salsa band. We had to drive app. 30 km to get home and when we got out of the city the girl in the back saw &#34;something iin the sky&#34; so first we thought that there was a party going on somewhere. But as it was still there 5 minutes later we thought that it could bea car mooving with a light on lthe roof or something like that. But when we realized that it was a forest ti couldn&#39;t be that neither. Therefore, even I, who normally does not belive in such things, started to get nervous. We tried to stop the car to see if we could hear something but no sounds were there besides some birds. The sky was not cloudy but not totally free from clouds neither. There were som kindof fog. But it could not be a helicopter; if it were a helicopter I would have been able to see it above. An det light was not comming from the ground neither. We started the car again an drove app. 10 kmBut as it was &#34;following&#34; us we stopped the car once more. When we stopped the car it stopped too. It was always right beside us. When we passed through a small village we thought that we had lost it, but when we got through it rejoined us beside the road. We were driving from Fos sur Mer to Salon de Provence in South France. The singer who was sitting in the back (the girl who first saw the thing) claimed that she had seen exately the same ting in December last year with 2 friends as they were taking a walk in the forest. But it has only lasted for app. 10 seconds. This time the light followed the car for app. 25 km even when we took some sharp turns and when wh changed the road etc. it was right beside us.The Light:It was round but not like a circle. It was more like some small sqaures of light that was turning first one way and then the other in a smooth way. The center changed size all the time; it was like someting pulsing - like a heart. Around of the center there were the smaller squars of light og allwas turned in the same direction.It was like one of the best science fiction moovies ! It changed size, higth and speed. And it was sure that it followed us because wo drove app. 3 km through the city and made some very sharp turns. If it had been something from the ground id would have had to pass through a forest, a lake and one more forest. If it was comming from the sky it made no sound at all and it could see us even when we drove with the lights out. When we arrived at Salon de Provence it stopped following us and returned to where we came from.We were all affraid as it was clear that this could not be explained. Even the driver who is a non-believer was affraid.The persons in the car:  ((4 names deleted)).

Mall, July 4th 1997|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90895.html|128|ndxe199707| elongated and flattened 6&#34;dome,&#34; with 1 bright light, hovers and darts like dragonfly, D.C. Mall, July 4th 1997<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve decided that I should finally share something that I and my friend and at least one other person saw over 10 years ago. It&#39;s something to add to your database so that it could perhaps be correlated to other incidents.  Please note that I&#39;m actually not certain that this happened on Independence Day 1997; it may have been Independence Day of 1996.  But my friend and I have talked about this event many times since then, and we&#39;re 80 percent sure it was 1997.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m a D.C. metro area educated professional, in my mid 30&#39;s. I&#39;ve long been interested in both aviation and astronomy, and know quite a bit about each.   I&#39;m generally a very skeptical, practical and evidence-oriented person, and until the moment of this sighting, I would not have given the UFO topic the time of day.  But there were multiple witnesses to this event, so I can&#39;t simply dismiss it, and yet I also can&#39;t explain it in any conventional way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I had been to the National Mall in Washington D.C. to view the 4th of July fireworks. We had taken the Metro rail into the city, were there at The Mall all day, watched the fireworks, and they had recently ended.  We had not consumed any alcohol. The crowd there had been huge, obviously, so we waited a bit for the masses of people to thin out instead of trying to sardine ourselves onto a Metro car.  This incident therefore must&#39;ve occurred around 11p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were walking on the Mall on the eastern side of Washington Monument, headed west, toward the northern-most entrance to the Smithsonian Metro station.  We were not far at all from the entrance, certainly within 100 feet, when we first saw this small object.  We have always referred to it as the &#34;dragonfly UFO&#34;  (Googling that phrase now, I see it has its own meaning in UFO circles.  But what we saw looked nothing like that infamous hoax.)   This object was to our left, slightly above eye-level, and I&#39;m certain it was within 15 feet of us for this 30-second duration, and at several moments probably less than half that distance.  It was about 6 inches at its longest, and it darted and hovered the way a dragonfly or hummingbird might, with extremely quick and abrupt stops and starts. Like gravity and inertia were barely an inconvenience.  It would be hovering for a handful of seconds, and then in almost an instant it would zip over and be hovering several feet away.  We saw this particular movement probably 5 or 6 times.  The object was definitely intelligently controlled, as it seemed interested in the people in the area. It made no sound whatsoever, and given this thing&#39;s proximity to us we should have heard something. (Even considering the background noise.) It was just astounding to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object consisted of two main parts: a very bright main light up above, and underneath that a handful of inches was a slightly illuminated, metallic-looking dome.  Like a slightly flattened and elongated top half of a softball.  But I&#39;m less certain of that aspect, since it was hard to see past the object&#39;s upper main light.  That light was a very bright, with a yellowish and brilliant glow, facing forward from what I perceived to be the object&#39;s front.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most interesting feature of this object, to me -- what I could see since it was slightly lower than the &#39;body&#39; (itself below the main light) -- was that there seemed to be two small, slightly yellow and luminescent areas of &#34;haze&#34; underneath the central area, the area where wings should&#39;ve been. This haze reminded me of the heat that rises a few inches from black asphalt on a hot summer day, but it was more intense and turbulent -- finer, in a sense.  These hazy areas were basically spherical and not very large -- maybe 2 or 3 inches -- sitting just below the body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the object left, about 30 seconds after we first saw it, it flew towards our front left (south to southwest) very rapidly, and in a basically flat trajectory.  This would be towards what is now the Whitten Building.  It left at a speed of probably 80-100 mph, but it reached this speed very quickly, in only a second or maybe slightly more.  And one thing I specifically remember extremely clearly is that this object, when hovering and darting, did not have to yaw or turn in any way to accommodate the direction in which it was about to fly.  Knowing aviation as I do, this struck me as particularly odd. So, standard fixed- or rotor-wing flight principles were not at work here.  They just weren&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object clearly was not flying aerodynamically, or based on standard lift, and yet I&#39;m confident it was intelligently controlled.  Its near instantaneous stopping and starting, the lack of sound, the unique brilliance of the top light... it was amazing.  As strange as it sounds and as! hard as it has been for me to come to terms with, I simply cannot imagine that this object was manufactured by humans.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that many people had to have seen this object that night. I&#39;m amazed that I&#39;ve not been able to find any similar reports.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Instantainous bright blue light in sky caught my eye. As I turned to look, it appeared to be an oval shaped blue glow just sittin there. Then it glowed a soft orange around the outer sphere and shot through a cloud bank, I could still see the bright glow through the hazieness of the cloud . faster than I could react, or say anything to anyone it was gone , just like that, no big production just flat gone! When I turned to my son who was standing next to me, he was already looking up at me. He asked me what the light was and I knew then that I was not seeing any sort of firework or pyrotechnics. It was flying at around the same altituide a commercial airliner would, but I&#39;ve never seen anything move so quick. And there was NO sound as it shot across the sky .<n>

I have never seen anything like it in my life it was a bright greenish cigar shaped light with a thin streak of white light behind it. The one thing we all noticed was how strait and steady it was as strait as could possibly be. There was no sound at all. The object seemed to be moving at the speed of light. It sent chills through me as I saw it and my wife and sister. We all believe this was without a dought a ufo. We were watching the local St.Louis News and heard that other people saw the same thing some distense away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness means an evening sighting.

As I watched it, I ruled out the possibility of a plane or fire work.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I was standing outside watching the firecrackers go off through binoculars, when i noticed something in the air. I focused in on it, and i saw that it wasn&#39;t a plane. it had red/orange lights on it, and around it. it was just kind of hovering, not moving like you see a plane. Then I lost site of it. I scanned the sky, and found it. It had shooted up at a very fast speed, and at a really steep angle. Now it was hovering over a field. I went inside to get my camera, and when i came back outside, it was gone. It never appeared again. Also, this has nothing to do with it, but a picture taked in the 50&#39;s of a UFO, well the people are my neighbors! The thing I saw was disked shaped, and it slopped up on the sides to form almost a triangle shape.<n>

The lite was Tri-shaped with the brightess part beeing the top and bottom. It appeard as if it was sitting with the lights off then turned them on and moved at the same time. It was under the clouds because the lite from it reflected off the clouds like lighting does. It then move so fast in my field of view I had to turn my head to keep up with it.  It wasn&#39;t moving downward or upward it looked as if it was moving straight across the sky. We ran in to tell my girlfriend and our friend and they were like it&#39;s the 4th of July,It was prob. a rocket.. I said No way, then on Tues.7/8/97(today) the friend who didn&#39;t believe said she heard about it on the radio this morning that other people saw it..  It&#39;s been on the news and someone has a video tape of it that they played. They reported that as many as 200 people called in to report it..   my name is ((name deleted)) I&#39;m 21years old.

He saw that &#34;blue/green ball&#34; on the 4th of July.  He explained pretty much what the radio reports had said.  He said most of his family saw it.  He explained what he saw without even hearing the radio report.  After he told me what he saw, I told him that he matched the reports.  He is POSITIVE that it wasn&#39;t an airplane or a firework.  Other than that, he has no idea.  It isn&#39;t really that big of a deal to him.  He could care less.  I just find this facinating. Here is an additional note:  One of the crew of radio station KMOX in St. Louis also saw the light in the sky.  He saw it while station out on the KMOX building balcony as he waited for the Fair St. Louis fireworks to begin.  Try and contact him for more info.  They have a website.  Just search for KMOX.  Thanks. Note:  I did not see it.<n>

The lights dropped another WAY brighter light that was white to the ground.  Then the most awesome part was that they just disappeared.  My husband, self and six year old daughter witnessed this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving East on Lake Blvd. in Redding, my husband pointed out a set of two lights that were not normal in formation nor in appearance for an airplane.  They were, from where we stood, approximately a quarter of an inch big each, amber in color, moving slowly north by north east?  When we pulled over to the side of the road after the first minute or so we realized they were not airplanes nor were they any other conventional type of air vehicle.  These were two lights going next to each other, approximately two inches apart, in unison as if hooked at the middle.  We could not differentiate if they were indeed hooked or not, but if hooked together by something this object would have to have been huge.  While sitting there freaking out at these lights, seeing them not blinking, or anything else, moving slowly, they headed north.  After a period of approximately 3-5 minutes, the further away of the two lights moved upward and dropped a giant white light from its bottom an!d this light was five times the size of each of the orange lights and dropped to the ground completely.  It was a huge white light that was so bright that it hurt our eyes.  The two other amber lights, still virtually in unison went out at that point and one popped sort of red for a second as they went out then disappeared completely.We are awestricken!  It seems that even though we stood near our car atop a big city hill gaping and screaming it&#39;s a ufo that nobody else stopped, however, someone had to have seen these...they were too obvious.<n>

We were directly in the path of the beam and looked up into it as it illuminated us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During 4th of July family fireworks, a large, low-flying object (could have been an airplane) with bright red lights on it, beamed a large, very bright blue light down on the ground directly under the object.  Our family was directly in the path and as we were all illuminated blue, we looked up into the light.  It moved off towards the woods north of the house and the light was turned off.  Two of us saw it go off just before it would have gotten to the woods.  We all discussed this strange happening at length.  The object came from the direction of Columbia, IL and moved off north towards Cahokia, IL.  Our sighting was two miles east of Dupo, IL on Imbs Station Road, about 3/4 mile west of the intersection of Imbs Station Road and Triple Lakes Road.  Observers were:  my retired parents, two sisters-in-law (one is the wife of a US Air Force Colonel--the Colonel was lighting fireworks and did not see the light), my sister, myself, and several nieces and nephews.<n>

The object simple appeared in the sky, and was traveling from the Illinois bluffs towards St. Louis, Roughly E to W. All people noticed the object, half saying it was a meterorite, the others saying it was part of a fire work that had strayed. Niether of these two theories would work because 1) the object was very low as compared to other meterorites we had seen, and 1) we set up about 2-3 miles from the fireworks display therefore no stray objects could have traveled that distance.<n>

At first we thought it was a shooting star, but later we learned there were reports of similar objects seen in the area.  The object was about the size of a soccer ball and was electric blue around the core. It looked to be about 100&#39; above the gound and was visible for about 600 or 700 ft. and then suddenly disappeared.. The total time visable to us was 5 to 7 seconds.  There was no noise associated with the sighting..  There was only one object observed.  The observers are between 47 and 54 years old and business owners.  We have never seen anything like this.

My friends mom was on my deck and  i asked her if she saw that and she said yes. i asked my friend ,who was shooting off bottle rockets because i wasnt at the mom (ie turns), just as i said look at it and it sounded like he said yes , i looked away and then it was gone. it was way too high to be a firework, and way too bright to be a plane or helicopter, plus i couldnt hear any noise like that because my neighbors had stopped shooting off stuff for about 30 min. it was high enough that i couldn&#39;t tell if it was over St.Charles County,or over St.Lous County because we are very close.<n>

It got us talking about shooting stars and stuff.  Heard it on the radio today (KMOX) and thought I would pass this along. I&#39;ll start by saying I am not a UFO fanatic, I don&#39;t believe in aliens or beings from other planets.  But I certainly saw something unusual the other night. It was between 9:15-9:45, we were waiting for fireworks (the show started at 9:45). My 6 year old noticed it first, and caught my attention. It was green, bullet shaped (like half a capsule.  A rounded edge, flat back.  No stream or tail). Streaked across the sky, and vanished about half way across.  It moved quite quickly, maybe I saw it for 2-3 seconds before it was gone. At first I thought it was some unusualy fireworks (but thinking it is very large).  Then it disappeared as a firework would, but with no explosion or fanfare.  Just gone. It was quite large, perhaps as large in sight as a full moon. If I have my bearings correct, it streaked from North to South. I was at White Birch Park in Hazelwood, MO (St Louis county), facing McDonnell Blvd, it streaked from my left to right.<n>

However, this was moving much too fast to be an aircraft and we did not hear any noise. The observers were a family group. Males and females, ages 18 to 45.<n>

Everyone in my party and including a friend of my father&#39;s who was also at the same event saw it.  I thought it could be a firework malfunction but no sound can from it and it was located far from the barge where the fireworks were being launched.  The fireworks that were shot off didn&#39;t even come close to the place in the sky where the ball of light was minutes before located.  The light also moved horizontally through the sky.<n>

At approximately 2115, I was looking up at helicoptors that were moving around the river and immediate airspace over the city near the Arch.  At about that time, I happened to notice an object, moving at an extremely rapid rate through the sky, almost directly overhead. The duration of the event was so short that I thought that it might have been some kind of meteorite or something similar.  The object was bluish-green in color, like a streaking fireball in shape, and moving east to west at a speed much faster than any aircraft, flare, fireworks, or shooting star/meteorite I have ever seen before.  The light gave off no observable sound, nor was there some kind of sonic boom or anything of the sort. I commented on it to my friend who missed it and wasn&#39;t interested in my observation.  I overheard others in the crowd in my immediate area comment on the light, so I&#39;m pretty sure that there are others who can comment on seeing the light.  I am writing this, only because I happened to see a report in the news today about a similar series of observations across the river in Illinois.<n>

It was obviously not a firework, but I didn&#39;t know what it was.  I figured itmust have been a firework, or a plane on fire, or an asteroid or something.  But it was really too bright for any of that.  It didn&#39;t actually have a tail, it was more of a streak of light.  Fireworks started 15 minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a computer systems analyst.  My girlfriend is a cash dept.supervisor.  My father is an engineer for McDonnell Douglas.

We were facing the back yard, seated in lawn chairs, talking, and all of a sudden the entire back yard (about an acre of ground) lit up in blue light.  We looked over our left shoulders (both of us, there was no sound and yet oddly we both looked over our left shoulders at the same exact time) and there was a bright blue light hovering there.  It was just that... a light and it stayed there pulsating for about 5 seconds I&#39;d say... then it started to move and just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom and I don&#39;t tell anyone about this because we know people will think we are nuts.  This is the first time I&#39;ve ever put something like this out there.  We have no reason to try to make people believe that we saw what we saw.  I just thought I&#39;d post this so that others out there that also have witnessed something as strange as this don&#39;t feel like they are alone.  I&#39;m sure that some day what we all saw will come to &#34;light&#34; - pardon the pun.  By the way, (in the US) from California to the east coast people saw this blue light at precisely the same exact time of day.  It was noted in the papers and news but was dismissed by scientists as possible meteors... though my mom and I, and everyone else who witnessed it, knows it could not have been - for it never hit the earth and it was hovering.  A meteor would not stop in the air.  I was not scared of this light... though looking back on it I&#39;m surprised that I wasn&#39;t ... because it was so incredibly &#34;odd&#34; (that&#39;s the best word I can use right now to describe it)... nothing I&#39;d every seen before and I don&#39;t necessarily believe in aliens or things of the like.  I did feel afterward that night that we had been &#34;observed&#34;.  It&#39;s a strange thing to say... and it was a strange thing to feel at the time.  My mom and I joked that it was taking our picture... then over a year later we were talking about it aga! in  and discussed the possibility of it being some government testing type of object... but that too sounds too strange to believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, don&#39;t feel like you are alone .. all of you who have seen something like this... but then again don&#39;t try to convince anyone who didn&#39;t see it for themselves because they will only think you are nuts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My own dad and sister don&#39;t believe my mom and I.... we just don&#39;t talk about it to them because we too would likely not believe someone had we not seen it for ourselves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report received by MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP  - http://ufomig.bravehost.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to the MISSOURI INVESTIGATORS GROUP, and to its Director, BARBARA BECKER, for their having shared this report with our Center.

Looking up, it traveled from approx. 11 o&#39;clock to 2&#39;oclock and lasted approx. 5 seconds then disappeared.<n>

I am sure of the date and time, as it was the 4th of July, and my brother and I were living in Phoenix at the time.  We had decided to go to a small desert park near Camelback Mountain, climb some rocks and watch the fireworks in the city below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We parked at a dead end street and were walking toward the desert when I noticed an odd thing in the sky, moving rather slowly.  It was nearing dusk and the sky was cloudless.  The item was dark and had an irregular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed it out to my brother and he quickly went back to his truck to get a pair of binoculars that he always carried with him.  We estimated that it was about 800 feet above the ground, and it was moving south to north, very smoothly, as if propelled in some manner (not moving erratically or intermittently as a balloon might do).  If it was at the estimated height of 800 feet then we guessed that it might have! been from 10 to 12 feet in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We each got a good look at it in the binoculars, and it appeared to be nothing so much as an uprooted tree with roots dangling below.  There was some kind of rotating platform on the upper portion of the “tree roots,” and some kind of a weird-looking appendage that stuck out of the top of the rotating platform.  The appendage was very thin and slightly curved, and appeared to be dangling something over the side of the rotating platform.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Astonished, we stopped two passers-by who were also heading into the rock formations and pointed out the bizarre thing in the sky.  They took a look at it through the binoculars as well, made a comment about how odd it was (I guess!) and then strolled off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood and watched the thing disappear over the mountains into the darkening sky, total time of sighting was approximately 10 minutes.  There were no lights on it, and it made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night my brother and I agreed to separately draw what we had seen and compare the pictures.  It was clear that we did see the same thing.  We have no idea what it was.  My brother has since passed on but he was an astronomy major in college, and I had spent six years in the military.  We were both over 40 years old at the time of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We considered all possibilities, but could not even venture a guess as to how such a thing could be hoaxed.  Since that time, I’ve heard about the “jellyfish” UFOs and have wondered if that is what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since we expected to be spending time in the dark outside, we had no camera with us and this was long before the cell phone age, unfortunately.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to mention this event which we did not report at the time, in case anyone else has seen something similar and would like to know if others have had the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hello Mr. Davenport,<n> <n><n> <n><n> thank you so much for noticing my report.  My brother who was with me at the time passed on in Florida in 2009 and many of his effects were boxed and given to friends, so I don&#39;t have his original drawing, and I have moved so many times since then, that I&#39;m sure I have no idea where mine went.  I could certainly re-draw it, however.  It&#39;s not a thing I&#39;m ever going to forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been a Coast listener for many years, but it never occurred to me to report my sighting, until I recently heard you mention that you were interested in past reports, as well as new ones.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was visiting your site for the first time this past weekend and reading mostly about the Washington reports since I live here now.  I went to Arizona&#39;s listings too and checked around the date of my sighting and saw there were some reports from that date in Arizona, but nothing very similar to mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interesting that you mentioned Mars, by the way -- I&#39;ve always been particularly fascinated by that planet and have been following Curiosity&#39;s progress toward Mt. Sharp over the last few years.  I also spend a lot of time on Google Mars just roaming around to see what they will allow us to see, and I never get tired of that.  I can&#39;t wait until we have Google Venus and Google Saturn, etc.!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was impressed to find that the dates of your collected reports went back so far.  What a great resource for researchers.  Now that I&#39;m familiar with your site, I&#39;ll check it often, and be sure to add my own sightings, should I have any more in the future.  Kudos for all the very hard work you must do to keep it organized and available to everybody.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I&#39;ll be glad to redraw the UFO I saw.  I do have a cell phone available so I can send a pic through email or as a phone message attachment, or I can just snail-mail it to you if you like.  Let me know how you&#39;d prefer to receive it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you, once more for all that you do and especially how you share it so freely with all of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely, ((name deleted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n>

I like to watch people, so I started watching the crowd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed what I thought was a water tower or the top of a very tall parking lot light sitting over the cliffs to the east.  The cliffs were about 2-3 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object sat just above the horizon of the cliffs.  It looked like it was made of shiny metal, like chrome. As I said, I thought it was a water tower or light, but I couldn&#39;t see any support pole of any kind.  It was a bright, clear, and sunny day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to stare at the object waiting for my eyes to resolve the support pole.  After about 35-40 seconds, I looked back at the band (I was tired of looking at what I thought was a water tower).<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 more seconds, I looked back at the cliffs, but it was gone.  I never shifted my feet and the area of the sky I could see was very small (about 5 degrees side to side, and about 2 degrees top to bottom) because of the trees framing the top.  I had to be looking at the same area of the sky.  I moved my upper body back and forth, and up and down to find the object again, but it was not there.  I walked around to the other side of crowd so I could see more of the sky, but could not find a water tower or light.  The object had simply disapeared.<n>

Better to say: an angular formation of lights because there were no lights on the &#34;back side&#34; of the object. There were 4-7 white lights on both &#34;sides&#34; of the triangle. One light was in the &#34;front corner&#34;. The object made no sound. It made a circling motion. The axis of this motion was close to one of the &#34;sides&#34; of the craft. After ca. 2 min it vanished either by turning off the lights or disapearing behind the clouds or both. ( the sky was semi clouded ). The size of the object ( it&#39;s altitude was at cloud layer ) must have been that of a passenger aircraft at least. I don&#39;t remember if the white lights were blinking. It looked like this: ( not sure about the number of lights ) The &#34;X&#34; represents the axis of motion. O X   O   O O       O O           O<n>

I walked basically south from the back of my home and placed the trash in the herbie. When I turned around, facing north, I could see a traingular shaped craft moving slowly east to west. I was able to tell its shape by the way it blacked out the starfield in the sky. It had a row of soft green dashes down the forward two edges, three on each edge. It appeared to pass in front of the house, but I was unable to get a sense of depth, so I could&#39;nt tell if it was a large craft far away or a small one close. There is an airport about five miles from where I live, so we&#39;re used to aircraft noise. There was no noise that I could hear, not even that soft blowing sound of a high flying jet. It moved slowly westward until it disappeared behind the treeline. Th whole thing lasted less than two minutes. I attended the Thunder over Louisville air/fireworks show the next day. They had the 117-A Stealth Aircraft on display and the B1-B Stealth Bomber made a pass over the crowd at the event. Perhaps what I saw was the craft flying in for the show.<n>

After carrying everything down to the campsite, cooler, tent, chairs, firewood etc. I decided to take it easy so I unfolded a chair and sat down, cracked open a beer and gazed out on the beautiful scene before me facing the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time it was dark and had grown chilly from the breeze coming off the lake and my girlfriend went into the tent to put on a sweater. After a few minutes I started to get this feeling like there was something behind me and I was getting this strange electrical sensation up and down my spine and the hairs on the back of my neck were standing on end. So I stood up and turned around and there was this white sphere hovering over the treeline. I stood and stared for a second then I looked over at the tent to yell at my girlfriend to come out and look at this thing and she was already standing there looking at it too. She said that she felt this strange electrical sensation too so she came out of the tent and there it was. We stood there for a moment looking at this sphere and all the sudden it flashed at us three times, a pause, three times again, another pause then two times and then disappeared leaving this weird haze behind. I know this because the moon was almost full and shing very brightly that night but this was definitly not the moon! We discussed leaving but didn&#39;t. The next morning we were talking to the people who own the campground and they have a house with a big picture window that overlooks the lake and they said one night they saw something hovering over the lake and sending a beam down into the water. They called a state trooper who came and also witnessed it and called it in and they said they had this thing on radar out of Holland MI. This happened almost ten years ago at the time of this writing and everytime I tell someone about what we saw I get chills like I got just prior to seeing what we saw!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was traveling in a very slight south east to north west direction..I own a compass. I first saw the object at the far southeast horizon through the trees. It was flying extremely low and seemed to pass over the subdivision I live in. I heard no noise what so ever. The best way to describe the size is if you hold a regluar size pencil at arms length, then it would be about that size looking at it from a distance. Called the local police to see if any strange thing had been reported. They said no. Called the airport control tower at Nashville, Tn (Brentwood is next to Nashville and I live about three miles from the Davidson (Nashville) county line. Talked to a controller, he said the only thing they had was a life flight helicopter coming in from the north. I made a official report with the controller. My! house is in a very quiet neighbor hood. Planes can be seen on approach patterns from various view points from my house. Some far some fairly close. Hot air ballons and civilian and military helicopters sometimes pass over the neighbor hood. In talking about this sighting with different people, I found that others had seen similiar lights between 22:00 and 23:00 on 06/27/97. Two people were witnesses This sighting was reported as very high and seeing only the bright white cylinder shape.The speed was reported as faster than an airplane at the same height.  The same object was seen at a lower altitude by three women at 02:00 hours on 06/28/97, about 7 miles distance from the 06/27/97 sighting. The speed was reported as being extremely fast.<n>

I was inside a house, and a bright light was seen with my peripheral vision though the window.  I looked out the window to see the object better, and then went outside for an even closer look.  I saw a bright white light in the shape of a sphere.  The object was just below a thin layer of clouds with a full moon above.  The object would move around a small area with high speed and maneuverability.  Several times the craft would shoot straight up into the atmosphere until it was out of sight and then return to the same location below the clouds.  This occurred several times.  If an airplane came into view the light would disappear until the plane was out of sight.  The craft was visible for at least 30 minutes.  I went inside the house to get a 35mm camera.  However, I was not able to get the camera to focus on the object so that a picture to be taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I know this because I heard door opening and  went out to the living room to see who it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed my mom and dad were acting strangely; they were sitting on the sofa, staring into distance like they were in a trance. But, I didn&#39;t think much of it and went back to my room. It was about 15 mins later that my mom ran into my room where I and my sisters were playing video games. She told us that there was an UFO outside and the neighbors had gathered to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, the five of us rushed out (mom,dad me and my two sisters)to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The neighbors had gathered in the parking lot and they were all looking up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was the size of a nail head, glowing red, about 80 degrees angle up in the sky. It was stationary with no pulsating light. It stayed there for about 10 plus mins when it shot away toward SW in a red line and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that, I asked my mom and dad, why did&#39;t they tell us immediately after they got home. My mom said that for some reason, she had forgotten to do so.  Then, I asked her, what took them so long to take out trash?  Did they go somewhere else?  She said no, they didn&#39;t go anywhere else expect going to the dumpster, and it was my dad who saw the UFO first on the treetop behind the apartment complex.  The object was about the size of a quarter when they first saw it.  Then, my mom urged him to go home because she was in fear.  And, they were in disbelief when they found out that they were gone for almost two hours.  They had no memory of what had happen during the time lost.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After hearing that, I went to the windows and saw an object falling from the sky that looked like a huge meteorite in the general direction were the UFO had disappeared.  The object was bright white with a tail. I also noticed a big chuck of it broke off just before it disappeared behind the treeline.  If my estimation were correct, it landed somewhere between Springfield and Northampton.<n>

It had 4 lights in front, a bright light underneath, a wavelike column of yellow-orange light in back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last year, on July 2nd, on the 50th Roswell anniversary, I was at my pond with a friend. We saw a very bright light, which looked brighter than Venus, in the Northwestern sky. It was 21:30. It was very high in the sky, and looked like a very bright star. We observed it as it got closer. By 21:40, the sky was dark, the aircraft was very close to us. By that time, we could see 4 lights, two on each side of an inverted, very broad V. The lights looked like the headlights of two cars flying sideways. We could see the air move around the lights, like you can see the air move over a hot road in the summer. The aircraft came down right over us, it was barely over the fir trees around my pond, maybe 100 feet directly above us. There was absolutely no noise, except for a barely audible hum which seemed to encompass everything. There was no noticeable air movement. The aircraft was going very slowly, maybe 20 or 30 mph. At that point, we could see its underside: it was rectangular in shape, light colored, and the very bright light we had seen earlier was right underneath the middle, lighting itself more than the ground. We could see two wings, the tips of which barely went beyond the rectangular underside. The whole aircraft was very large, at least as large as a large commercial airplane. As it started going beyond us, we could see from its outline against the sky that it was triangular in shape, probably dark in color. The back of the aircraft had a vertical column of yellow-orange light. The light moved up and down the column in a seamless wavelike pattern. The pattern was not regular, and when I told my friend that it looked more like a language of some sort than a simple aircraft lighting system, at that very instant, the pattern changed completely. After that, the aircraft started going back up and disappeared behind a hill. I tried to report this sighting to one local newspaper and one TV station the next day. I wanted to find out if anyone else had seen it. I got some chuckles and I did not insist. This year, on July 2nd also, I invited my friend for a sky-watch evening. She could not make it, but 2 other friends came. The sky was perfectly clear. Around 21:30, we saw a very bright light in the South sky, just as I was describing my experience of the previous year. One friend pointed to that light and asked: &#34;You mean to tell me this is a UFO?&#34; Within 2 seconds, the light was gone. It just faded away. My friends went home. Later that night, at 23:00, I went to pick up my daughter from town. On the way back, I saw the same bright light, closer than before, I showed it to my 14 year old daughter, and it was gone before she had a chance to see it. Around midnight, I went outside and saw the same bright light close-by in the Northwest sky. As soon as I concentrated my attention on it, it disappeared. 10 mn later, I looked out my bedroom window and saw the light again in the Western sky. I went to get my binoculars, pointed them at the light, it disappeared. I went to sleep. I am a 49 year old female, and I grow grapes and aromatic plants. I also teach plant propagation. My female friend who saw the large aircraft with me is an herbalist, as are the 2 other friends who saw the lights with me. Neither of us believed or disbelieved the presence of UFOs before.<n>

We were chatting a few minutes before we went to our respective houses.  As I started to get out of the car to unlock the passenger door (the lock was broken at that time).  We both noticed a halogen bright light appear above the shopping center that is about the length of a football field away.  We both assumed that it was the lights of the center comming on for the evening.  As I got out of the car I saw that the lights were not yet on and I assumed that it was a small plane.  The city airport is about two miles away.  As I was walking around the car and looking up a small plane came into view.  And I could clearly tell that it was not a plane.  When I got to the door the light started ascending and moving in a northward direction.  I ran back around to the drivers side and hopped inside, and said &#34;Well what do you think?  Let&#39;s go?&#34;  My friend said ok.  We began to follow this light for about two miles on Petaluma Blvd.  (This road runs parrell with 101.) The light stopped moving, so I drove into a parking lot.  When I stopped the car we could clearly see the light above the tops of some trees.  The lights began to move and it looked triangular, and it appeared to sway in pendulum fashion.  It then began to descend.  We could then see it through the trees.  And it began to move north again.  All of the movements were very slow.  We got back onto Petaluma Blvd. and continued to go north for several miles.  It then stopped again.  We turned West onto Petaluma Blvd. over 101 to get gas. The light then began to move very slowly west.  We got onto Stony Point road and went in a northwest direction and then turned onto Liberty road heading west.  We stayed on this road  watching this light until we reached Petaluma Valley Ford road.  The light was moving out toward the Two Rock Coast Guard station.  We were stopped at the stop sign.  We then turned east and headed back toward Petaluma.  The light appeared to be headi! ng out toward the ocean.  During this sighting it seemed almost as if this light/object were doing survey or taking pictures.  It moved very slowly most of the time ascending and descending and appearing to change shape.<n>

7/1/97 21:00|Kingston|NY|Disk|3 mins.|A bright saucer UFO rose up from behind distant woods, turned left and glided out of sight.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58431.html|214|ndxe199707| A bright saucer UFO rose up from behind distant woods, turned left and glided out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting happened quite a while ago when I was about 8 or 9, and at the time I just took it as an incredible and unmistakable UFO sighting, and didn&#39;t think to see if there was a website I could report it to until just now (I&#39;m 19). Even though it wasn&#39;t very long or eventful, it is one of the most stark and obvious UFOs I&#39;ve ever seen (even against those in the media).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a summer night, and my sister, our next door neighbor and I were all outside in our field. We lived in an apartment house on top of a long driveway in an area that separates street blocks from more wooded and fielded terrain. We were in our field, looking at stars and just talking, when we saw a UFO rise straight up from behind the distant woods that were off to the right of our distant neighbors house, approximately 7-800 ft. from where we were standing. Notice how I checked the &#34;The object landed&#34; box, because this object almost definitely had to have been on the ground, because it was rising in a perfect vertical line from behind the trees. It appeared quite small (about the size of your fingernail if you were to hold it up to the sky), and no detail could be seen, except that it was extremely clearly a perfect saucer UFO straight out of a comic book. There were no individual lights, but it was completely glowing a very pure bright, gold light (this may have been due in part to the possibility that it was reflecting light as a faraway object, but it wasn&#39;t an ordinary reflective glow; it seemed engulfed in light, like the object itself was either VERY reflective, or emitting some kind of glow itself). There was absolutely no sound anywhere in the quiet of the night. It rose straight up at a mid-pace until it was very high in the sky, then without any shift in appearance whatsoever it made a perfect 90º left turn and continued at the same exact rate of speed, and just kept gliding in that direction until it was out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Despite my young age, I am certain there&#39;s no way it could have been any known aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I was out in the afternoon for some football with a friend. When he went to catch the ball, I just saw that disk shaped, silver coloured object, standing absolutely still in the blue sky! No engine sound, no smoke from the turbines (like airplanes do), so I guess it was a ufo! When I turned my head to see where my friend had gone and then back to the sky, it had disappeared in thin air! After a few minutes, there it was again, in a different loction, but again still and soundless. It was quite far away too. Then it disappeared again and that was it…<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was riding the M14 bus going Eastbound on 14th  street after finishing my shift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out of the window where I saw a black ball suspended in the Eastern sky.  I blinked several times thinking I was seeing things but there it remained.  At first I thought it was part of the building&#39;s fixtures but as the bus continued on its route, the ball remained fixed in the sky while the structures went by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The distance of the object was like holding a ballbearing at arms&#39; length.  The sphere was below cloud deck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was transfixed, wondered what it was, knew what it was and wondered again if the sky opened a hole and if it was space I was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I got off my stop it was hard to find it, with so many obstructions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day, I wonder where it came from and what the occupants look like though I get a chill since I get the sensation that they aren&#39;t human looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/1/97 01:30|Kilgore|TX|Circle|5 seconds|Two police officers, out on a hunting expedition, witness a dramatically bright "fireball" close to their position.|8/19/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91474.html|221|ndxe199707| Dear Sir,  I&#39;m ((deleted--middle age)) years of age and currently been employed as a ((law enforcement)) for the past ((deleted--approximately two decades)) years.  I&#39;ve spent more than enough time investigating everything from homicides, to conducting relatively rare under cover investigations.  I&#39;ll elaborate more if further documentation is required.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I first want to explain why I have never reported or discussed this situation.  I&#39;m currently a police office and served over 13 years; of those 13 years I have heard numerous encounters of &#34;suspicious circumstances&#34; among the local population.  None of these, however, have anything to do with what I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I currently live in the southwest area of Arkansas.  This area is home to the Fouke Monster, AKA big foot....  A recent television show included numerous people investigating areas that sightings have been made.  I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;ve hunted these areas on foot for over 8 years.  I&#39;ve never seen nor heard anything that I can&#39;t explain.  Needless to say I&#39;m not a man afraid of the! woods, strange noises or ... well ok I&#39;ll admit I am afraid of spiders....<n> <n><n> <n><n> So on to the topic of discussion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot give you the exact date.  I honestly have only spoken twice as of last night as to the event ever even happening.  I do not want to compromise anything by asking questions of the other person involved because we have never spoken of it.  I say we have never spoken of this situation, but we have spoken of it twice.   Neither time have either one of us spoken as to what we saw, when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can not recall the year, but I know it was late summer.  It was hot outside and the windows in my car were up.  I was driving an early model Chevy Nova 4dr car, maroon in color.  My friend, ((male name deleted)), and I were at a party.  We, for some reason, although it was alcohol related, decided to go &#39;big foot&#39; hunting.  Well I loaded up a bunch of guns into the trunk of the car, took some more beer, and we left... en route to the hunting grounds.   This is an area that I don&#39;t exactly know where we were at.  ((male name deleted)) said we were in the Tiawishi River bottoms.  I&#39;ve never heard that name or term before and still havn&#39;t.  So we went to where he said to go.  We were both drinking and having a good time as we headed to this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we arived to the area, I knew, just by being on the roads, that this was an oilfield back road type of area.  I was driving and continued driving down these back oil field roads.  I do not have a time frame or amount of time that we were driving but I know that we were on an oil field road.  We did have guns, but they were still in the trunk of the car.  We continued driving and if memory serves me, and we came to a bridge.  Once on the bridge, I stopped the car.  I/we decided to stop the car to listen to the sounds from the woods.  We didnt&#39;t hear anything..... and that is when it happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lack words to describe the scenario.... We were listening to the sounds of the woods, it was quiet, not unusually quiet....  While sitting in the car a bright light appeared from the right side.  A light that was brilliant in color, and I can only describe as being bright as the sun and the same color.  There was no sound, wind, or anything else to make you believe anything was ever there.  This sphere passed from my right to the left in a steady motion while maintaining static elevation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards ((male name deleted)) and I left...tried to describe what happened to us... and I remember that nobody believed us.... To date I have spoken to ((male name deleted)) two different times.  Once in November 2012 ((sic.  2011??)) , the conversation was brief and non discriptive in nature.... The second was on 08/04/12.....  The conversation was joking in nature and I realised after he said that he has had nightmares about that night since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what we saw together that night.  I&#39;ve told myslef so many times that it was swamp gas of sorts..... I&#39;m open for personal interviews and willing to take poligraphs, or what ever else we need to do....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Honestly, I want to have an answer that it was just swamp gas and methane gas combusted with decomposition products.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From what I remember it was just above the tree line, running in a directional path.  It never changed direction, speed or made any kind of sound,<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you would like to speak with me directly I can be contacted at ((deleted telephone number)).  I&#39;m employeed for the past ((deleted--approximately two decades)) at ((deleted--law enforcement))..  I would like my information kept confidential.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve not spoken of the details of what I saw the night that I believe what I saw.  I have spoken to ((name deleted)) and neither were times that we wanted to talk about it... after a laughing incident the previous date I decided that since we havn&#39;t spoken about what we have seen and my understanding of interviews... this might be a situation that can be explained or debunked....  I believe it&#39;s probably just swamp gas, at least that&#39;s what i&#39;ve always told myself!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM AUTHOR OF REPORT))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Dear Sir,<n> <n><n> <n><n> In reference to the sighting in east texas.

I awoke and saw 2 ailen looking creatures at the foot of my bead, they looked just like the one on the TV alien autopsey film.  I rember not being able to move nor was I afrade but actualy I knew their intent and was shamefully looking forward to the encounter.  I was concerned that my wife would wake up but I could hear the alien telling me she would not wake up and that &#34;this&#34; would not take long.  One of them moved towards my head and then I could not see the other one although I was looking for it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Rest of description is reminiscent of classical interaction/abduction experience.))<n>

This was really bizzare.  I was on East Freehold Rd, in Freehold, NJ near Rt 79.  I was on a part of the road at that time which was only woods.  No homes or anything.  I was going maybe 30 MPH and all the sudden me and my friend ((name deleted)) (from manalapan) saw a small orange light float right in front of my car, and then SPED off REALLY fast to the right of my car, into the WOODS.  THe light was small, maybe the size of a human finger.  We both saw it, and we were both sober and very much awake.  I no longer talk to my friend but this is something i will never forget.  Could there be UFO&#39;s that small with small creatures inside?  who knows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Oh no sound at all with the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
