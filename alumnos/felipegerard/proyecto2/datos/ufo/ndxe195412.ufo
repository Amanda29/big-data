My notes are in parenthesis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unidentified object seen from Yucaipa, California.  Dec 16, 1954.  From approximately 4:50 pm until about 6:00 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> [A figure drawing is included showing distant hills, the star Polaris, and the movement of an object in the sky illustrated as a line connected by dots.]  It moved very slowly from A to C, taking approximately 8 minutes.  [The objects arcs toward the ground, traveling east-to-west then rises to its previous altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Apparent size of the object is about equal to a pencil eraser held at arm&#39;s length.]  From C to D it moved swiftly, taking perhaps 30 seconds.  [Object rises very sharply in altitude to a point just west of Polaris.]<n> <n><n> <n><n> From D to E it moved slowly, and remained at E about one hour.  It hovered at E until apparently cut off by earth&#39;s advancing shadow.  [Object is shown just west of Polaris with very little movement.]<n> <n><n> <n><n> At no point did it appear metallic or sharply defined.  It was a bright yellow oval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A similar or identical object was reported for the same day in Los Angeles newspapers a day or so later. The object had appeared over Apple Valley and proceeded to the northwest where it hovered over Inyokern Air Base.  Jet fighter interceptors had been unable to reach it, the news report said.<n>
12/15/54 23:10|Red Bank|NJ|Circle|3-5 min.|Bright orange light, about the size of a pea at arms length, moving slowly from the west to NE.  I was a soldier, stationed at Ft. Monm|8/19/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13818.html|2|ndxe195412| Bright orange light, about the size of a pea at arms length, moving slowly from the west to NE.  I was a soldier, stationed at Ft. Monmouth, NJ at the time of the sighting.  As I walked west towards my barracks on a cold clear night in Dec., I first noticed the object at about 30 deg elevation.  It moved steadly on the same course for about 20 seconds.  Then, it abruptly stopped without decelerating for what seemed to be a minute or so.  It abruptly restarted, at the same speed as before and remained on the same course.  This behavoir repeated two more times.  Then the object zipped up at about a 70 deg. angle towards the NE, getting smaller as it disappeared in about 2 seconds.  During the observation period there was no sound, and no change in brightness or color.<n>
