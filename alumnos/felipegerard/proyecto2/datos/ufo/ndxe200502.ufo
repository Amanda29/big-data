2/28/05 23:30|Wellington|FL|Fireball|10 minutes|fireball-like sphere flickering in north-western sky|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42595.html|1|ndxe200502| fireball-like sphere flickering in north-western sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving north on Forest Hill Blvd coming home from ym girlfriend&#39;s house about 11:20pm on 2-28-05. I was looking to the left of my vehicle and in the distance I saw a wierd light in the sky. Planes fly overhead in this area often as I&#39;m close to a major airport, so I didn&#39;t think much of it, except planes are ussually white lights, and this was more orange, like an open flame. It also flickered slightly and had a slight haze around it. From my standpoint in my vehicle, it looked spherical in shape. I was watching it on and off while driving down the road as trees obscured my view every few seconds, but seemed to stay in the same position in the the horizon, so either it was stationary or it was moving directly perpendicular to me, like when a plane is coming right at you and it seems not to move. Then about 11:28, it just vanished. I searched the sky,but saw nothing but darkness and clouds. It didnt seem to have gone behind the clouds. More like if somone had hit a switch and turned it off suddenly. it looked very similar to something I saw back in 1998 or 99, when I saw a fireball coming down as if a meteor, but then leveled out its descent and cruised paralell to the ground for at least 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/28/05 22:15|Sevierville|TN|Triangle|1-5 minutes|Three lights in triangle shape hoover over houses, makes no sounds and flees as we begin to investigate|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42668.html|2|ndxe200502| Three lights in triangle shape hoover over houses, makes no sounds and flees as we begin to investigate<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and myself were traveling home from work on February 28, 2005 at approximately  10:15 P.M. We had just made a left turn on Boydes Creek Road heading east toward Servierville TN, when I first noticed a strange, very large, little in the sky a mile or so ahead. At first I only glazed at it and did not mention anything to my father. As we got closer to the object I saw the there were three individual lights with no pulse and it was completely motionless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was at that point that I asked my father what he thought it was. He immediately anwsered, &#34;It&#39;s a plane,&#34; but as he looked closer he too noticed the lack of flashing lights and its stationary position. At this time we could both see that the three lights were in a triangle formation, but could see nothing of a vessel. The light were only about 100 yards to our left and no more than 100 feet in altitude. My father then began to slow down in the middle of the highway, and as we came to an almost complete stop the object began to move away from us in a norhtwest direction almost like it knew we were looking(spooky). As we came to a full stop I already had begun to exit the vehicle when I immediately noticed no sound. My father and I both stood outside the car for about 30 seconds as we watched it fly away and never heard any sound except for those of nature.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects speed and movment was unlike anything either of us had ever seen. It seemed to go from a dead stop to an estimated 100 mph instantly, and then continued at that same velosity until we had to return to our vehicle. After we began to drive away my father called a co-worker who was in the car ahead of us. He to saw the lights with no flash and not moveing. He did not, however, stop or see it move.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The object seen was observed for approximately 30 minutes and was a fair distance away.  During this time, the object appeared to remain in the same location.  Other aircraft (probably passenger and freight planes) were seen traveling from the east to the west passing in close proximity.  The lights alternated colors at a regular interval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of Sirius??  PD))<n>
2/28/05 08:00|La Grande|OR|Oval|7 minutes|Oval-shaped and covered in lights but is quartered into four sections.  As brillantly lit as any star.|12/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48155.html|4|ndxe200502| Oval-shaped and covered in lights but is quartered into four sections.  As brillantly lit as any star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college student and I am the only person I know that has seen the UFO as far as I know, but there was a white semi-truck in front of me about three miles up Interstate 84.  I&#39;ve had this sighting awhile ago but I wrote it down the day I saw it, I am only now reporting it because I finally found a place to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I exited Lad Canyon to get to La Grande for my first class at nine o&#39;clock in the morning.  I saw what I first took to be the galaxy&#39;s largest star hovering over the city.  It was four times the size of venus at night, and it was bright and beautiful and didn&#39;t move.  However, I noticed a few strange things.  The sky was completely overcast and my star was in front of where the mountain outcrop would be behind the city, so it was no star and no one was driving behind me or on the opposite side of the interstate, so the light could not be a reflection of headlights in my windshield.  However, the oval light stayed hovering over La Grande long enough that I was able to drive several miles closer to it and I was able to distingish faint lines dividing the oval light into quarters, and somehow I got the impression that inside the quarters were several tightly pacted lights within, like stadium lights, but I could not see past the light to count them individually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I started to pass under an eletrical weather hazzard sign that warns people of dense fog or winds in the pass behind La Grande, the light started to move.  It made a wide turn and became super thin, like it had turned on its side, and I watched it disappear in a straight line to the east.  I have watched jets cross the sky many times, but this object left no smoke trail and the light disappeared in about five seconds while it seems to take jets forever to cross the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea what it could have been but I would love to see one again.  It had been so beautiful and I felt peaceful for having looked upon it.  The closest thing I can compare it to is a diamond filled with starlight.  I really could have used a camera right then so I could have looked on it always.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I could only see lights spinning around and around the outside of the U.F.O.  But there was a green light shining down from the bottom and a cow was being takin up to the ship.  It was the weirdest thing i ever seen.  After, that ship left about 2 minutes later another ship (maybe the same one) came back and it flew right above my head and it stopped right above me.  I ran for my truck and got in the truck and ran away.  The flying saucer flew away a soon as my truck to off.

It was subtle in it&#39;s movements as far as floating/gliding.  My brother and I were looking at the stars when my brother noticed the object in the sky. He pointed it out to me as it went directly above us and over the roof of the apartment building.  We ran outside to the direction it headed and it was gone.  The object looked oval with dark colored pertrusions in the shape of rounded rectangles off of the back 2/3&#39;s of it roughly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up and saw what I thought was an airplane (2 star-like lights flying parallel.) However if it had been the 2 winglights of an airplane, the airplane would have been flying directly to the left instead of straight forward. this struck me as odd, so I continued watching the lights. suddenly, one of them quickly moves closer to the other light, and then they zigzag, almost making an &#34;x&#34; in the sky. after this they continue moving very quickly until they dissapear behind the silhouette of the husky stadium and I do not see them again. My companion saw the 2 lights traveling together, but was not looking as they criss-crossed. I&#39;m interested in seeing if any one else saw something strange that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

These lights were approximately 2/3 of the way down from the Shafer Butte/Bogus Basin area and away to the northwest from that area so I know that it wasn&#39;t the lights from Bogus Basin or any vehicles on the road to/from Bogus Basin nor are there any buildings or structures of any kind in that area of the foothills.  The lights formed what appeared to be the windows or lights attached to a saucer shaped/disc type of object.  The object appeared to be of great size (approximately 100-200 meters across) since our vantage point was about 10 miles away and the object still appeared large to us. These bright golden lights would go on and off. We could watch them for a while while we kept driving, then they would just go off.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We had just started packing up our stuff into my truck and from the corner of my eye I noticed a light, or reflection.  I looked in the direction of the light, and saw a pale green light moving from west to east (right to left) over the mountains in the distance.  It wasn’t moving very fast, and at first I thought it was an airplane or helicopter, but the color of the light looked odd.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend and she confirmed that she saw it too.  We watched it move in this direction for about 10 seconds or so, and then, suddenly, the light went straight up at a very fast speed and disappeared.  My girlfriend was spooked and wanted to leave immediately.  We could not tell how far away or how big it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

However, on this morning we were awakened from a sound sleep by a noise that was directly over our house and was like a grinding noise, like a stump grinder or shredder. It was NOT a helicopter or plane. It was definitely coming from above and not around, and upon getting up to see if there was anything around, noted that there were no lights on around the neighborhood, nor did the sound seem all-encompassing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to be located directly over our house, toward the back bedroom area and lessened in intensity as I moved to the front and opposite end of the house. It seemed to make the house shudder, like a heavy vibration, but even though the sky was fairly clear, there was nothing in the sky when I got to the point where I could see out a window. I was afraid to go outside, because the noise was that threatening. My husband was as stunned as I and our daughter, who sleeps downstairs in the basement, was also awakened by the noise and the vibration. This is not the first time we have experienced what we believe to be extra-terrestrial events, though my husband and a friend witnessed the last event and have not posted it. My husband and I, though we have only been together since 1999, have both had previous experiences with ufos. We firmly believe this instance was another one.<n>

As I looked out, I saw a very large black Triangle above the clouds moving slow and once it came out of the clouds I could see lights going on and off all around the Triangle. The lights r not what u would see on a aircraft, they did not just go on and off,one would light up then go off and the next light would do the same  they would go on and off all around the Triangle, as if they where chasing each other. At first I through it was the B2 bomber, but I do not think it would have the type of lights I saw. I don&#39;t know maybe the miltary is testing a new plane? Also it was very large aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Sunday morning, February 27, 2005, I witnessed what I consider to have been a meteor &#39;fall&#39; from the sky and disintegrate.  My location is Staten Island, NY.  The location of the &#39;fireball&#39; was approximately, south - southeast.  It was as bright as a star but about four times the size.  This bright ball, somewhat mottled, suddenly appeared and made a diagonal path (about a 90 degree angle) through the midnight sky from right to left.  From my perspective, it traveled on this downward path for about a length of 9 cm. then disintegrated.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I watched for several seconds, as the brightness intrigued me.  It seemed that the &#34;star&#34; was changing colors: red, blue and white.  I went and got my binoculars.  Looking with binoculars, it appeared as a bright light, changing colors routinely from red, blue, white and occasionally all white, and then back to red, blue and white.  My husband came out to view it at my request at this point.  He noticed that it also appeared to be changing shape and size.  When it changed size to smaller, the lights tended to converge.  The object at first appeared to remain stationary in the sky (while still changing size).  I stood in one spot on my deck and made note of the surrounding background (i.e., a neighbor&#39;s pin-oak tree, where I noted the object in relation to the branches, and to determine whether it was moving.)  My husband and I continued to view this from 12 am to after 1:15 am.  After the first 15 minutes of viewing, it gradually &#34;migrated&#34; further to the right, so that after 1 am, it was far to the right of this pin-oak that I had used to &#34;measure&#34; this &#34;star&#34; and give relevance to its location.  It started to become more red and orange in color, and around 1:25 it was gone, seeming to have &#34;migrated&#34; beyond the mountain range to the west of Reno.  We made note of the other stars and the moon in the sky.  During the entire time of seeing this light, the position of the stars and moon had changed slightly, but the light was moving more gradually than the stars and moon, by far.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius.

Have heard this on previous occasion but ignored. Went outside to look. Helicopter appeared to be military as larger and heavier sounding than the police type occasionally seen. Helicopter very dark against sky. Sky and stars very clear, very sparse occasional cloud. Noticed a red stationery light in sky maybe 20 degrees above horizon, at first thought to be a star or planet but then realised that there was a circle of red lights all equidistant surrounding whole area at roughly same altitude. Distance unknown but above occasional clouds. Through binoculars lights appeared to change red and green. Helicopter appeared  to be tracking same circle. Through binoculars helicopter appeared to have in addition to minimal flying navigation lights two or more very bright red small lights located mid fuselage possibly lasers. Helicopter increased altitude for approx 5 minutes in direction of one light. Lights remained stationery for entire duration and helicopter circled for 1 hour approx. Helicopter then departed - lights remained but futher duration unknown as now very cold and tired so stopped watching. 3 adult members of family all saw same occurrence. Cause of lights totally unexplicable as nothing like this seen before.  Helicopter definitely monitoring them as flightpath matched the circle and occasionally hovered sideways to the lights. Possibly a military experiment? However these were not flares as did not descend or drift. Area is long known for strange occurences so hence report, have never seen this activity before. Have checked night sky since and no lights appear at locations seen on event so there is no confusion with usual star formations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

It was a solid craft and was shaped like the diamond on a baseball field. The craft was completely silent. The altitude was about the same as a traffic helicopter. No shining lights were visible on the craft at all. I believe it was visible due to it being illuminated by the light of the very bright moon that night. It travelled slower than a helicopter, with a smooth motion. I watched it for about ten seconds before it disappeared behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We looked ahead and saw a Triangular object hovering over a field.  The object had a red light on one corner, a green light on one corner, and a white light on the other corner.  It was sitting still and was app 200 ft off the ground.  We were app 350ft away from it.  We pulled over and watched for about 2 minutes and then it started moving very slowly and moved up about 200 ft until it was directly over our vehicle and then it sat there for app 45 seconds hovering over us and then a really bright light turned on and the other lights dissapeared.  It sat there for app 30 seconds after the bright light was on and took off really fast going in the direction of Scott Airforce Base.  It looked nothing like an airplane or a helecoptor.  It was much too large.  It was app twice the size of a C5 military plane, maybe alittle smaller.  We could see the object in the distance after zoomed off for app 15 seconds and then we lost sight of it.  It was too dark outside to see if the object left a trail or not.  The object made no noise at all.  I&#39;m not sure how long the object was there before we came accross it and I dont know if it landed either.  It was very low to the ground so it may have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

We live about 3 miles away. We saw an object that appeared black and round moving very slowly away from the airport. The sun had not set yet, so it was very easy to discern the shape at that point. It was traveling east, so it was coming towards us. Within 200 feet, the object spun, and took on a cigar shape. We ran outside to take a closer look, and by the time we got there, it had disappeared. That only took approximately 5-7 seconds. There were no clouds at the time close by. I have never seen anything like that in my life. I called the airport to report it, and was referred to the national guard station inside the airport. The gentleman I spoke with said that there were no test flights taking place, and asked if I had seen a bird. I am a 36 yr old woman, and I believe I would recognize a bird, as there were many flying at that time. If anyone could give me some insight on this, or possibly saw it, please let me know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

An airplane was heard, I looked up and saw what looked to be a star or bright light (approx. like Venus) at 45 degrees high in the sky due East.  The airplane passed, the &#34;star&#34; continued to shine and move approx. 15 degrees North in the sky from original sighting location.  The &#34;Star&#34; changed colors to red and rainbow colors and appeared to spin.  The color changed  back to white and red/rainbow colors several times.  At times, light appeared to change shape, like a disc moving about.  After approx. 5 mins, the light disappeared behind a cloud.  There was no contrail or smoke trail, as you would expect from a missile/aircraft test.  Please let me know if there were any other reports or miliary tests in the area.

They lasted variously from 5 to perhaps 20 seconds all moved in an easterly direction. I dont believe they were aircraft. Perhaps satellites but I have observed satellites for the past 8 years. These objects appeared not to move as fast as the satellites. Yesterday morning at approximately the same time and in the same location I observed 2 similar sightings. One lasted so long I thought it was the landing light on an inbound Lufthansa or other cargo flight. It was southbound. After about 25 seconds the light went out. About 10 minutes later another light, not quite as bright, appeared headed east southeast and lasted maybe 10 seconds. There was no sound. The only other aircraft in vicintiy was AK-62 departing  FAI at 0600. The lights I saw did not go near the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Directly south of the area i noticed an unusual light in the sky at what looked about 4500 feet in the air and what looked to be about eight miles south of where i was, overa local lake. i watched for a few minutes and noticed the light get very bright then dim a few times. it was sort of blue white and remunded me of a search light on the bottom of a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> while watching i noticed another light (not the same color, almost slightly amber)come towards the first light, then stop moving. i knew that this must be a ufo and callled the people in the bar(5) to come see. we watched a couple minutes during which time a small plane flew almost between the object and us, then went back into the bar. one individual said he had seen ufos many times before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> after a short time i decided to drive home (about 35 miles north) during the drive i watched the light through my rearview mirror. after about 23 miles i stopped, got out of my truck and notice the lights again. they had risen in the air to approx. 10,000 feet and moved about 25 miles further north. by this time i could see an outline of the crafts shape (Chevron) and that the craft was in my estimation about three times the size of a 747 jet. (if i had held a quarter at arms length it would not cover the object) I continued my drive the rest of the way to the town i live in and after that the object was still in the air, only a little higher and further north. the drive took approx. 40-45 minutes.  i went into another bar for about an hour and when i came out the object was gone.<n>

Moving north to south. Moving at an excelerated speed.  I was able to view this object for a period of 5 minutes when I was able to grab my digital camera.  I used the max setting for distance and took a picture.  To my surprise and shock I was able to have the camera record detail that my eye was unable to see. The best way to describe what was photogrphed is to picture an egg sunny side up, slightly tilted in the pan.  My camera caught what appears to be a saucer shaped disc with a concentrated black inner circle that appears to be atop the disc.  But the amazing detail is that it is surrounded by a brilliant white &#34;albumen&#34; that engulfs the saucer.  This white albumen was not visible to  my eye.  Upon relaying my sighting to my group of friends, I was told that my coworkers son also viewed something in the sky that night and refused to go to bed.  He swears that it was not a plane or any known craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To see the picture speaks volumes of what I witnessed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

When I saw a guy across the street from my house was looking at something in the sky so I looked to see what he was looking at. We saw four fireballs in the sky about a mile or so in the sky. They seemed to be playing with each other, that lasted for about 45 minutes, and then it seemed like they knew we saw them and they got real close and started to change color and then it was like someone just put the fire out they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I looked up in the sky and saw what looked to be a sphere/slight cigar shape metallic object very high up almost in space.  I alerted two of my friends that were standing in my yard with me and they saw it also.  I ran inside and got my telescope and while i was gone my two friends said they saw it speed up and then come almost to a dead stop.I couldnt focus my telescope in on it because of the bright glare of the sun that it was reflecting but all three of us watched as it slowly went from north to south eventually disappearing below the tree line.<n>

And I also zoomed in on it several times.When I ran the video on the vcr, there was no doubt that what I saw throgh the lens was a UFO..

I have witnessed plenty of &#34;unidentified&#34; things but this beats me.  My sons (ages 18 and 14) and I were delivering morning papers.  One was in the car with me, one was outside.  I checked my watch immediately after the event.  As we were looking north over the city from our position we observed an object (that we believed was a meteor due to it&#39;s speed and blue-white color - but no tail) come over the car from the south-southeast toward the north-northwest.   As this object approached the horizon and we expected it to &#34;burnout&#34;, it suddenly stopped, hung motionless for a fraction of a second, and dropped straight to the ground in a controlled fashion, still lit blue-white.  It slowed as it descended, like an elevator. Wierdest thing I ever saw.  I estimate the range of the object to have been between 7 to 10 miles away.  It scared the heck out of both kids not to mention me.<n>

After watching it for awhile, he thought it looked like there were actually two objects dancing around each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He came and woke me up, and we tried looking at it with my binoculars (which are better than some telescopes).  I too thought it looked like there were two separate things.  It looked like a ball of light, about the size of a very large star, and sometimes it would separate into two balls of light.  Even through the binoculars it still only looked like balls of light with red and blue parts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometimes the two things were so close together it looked like one, and sometimes they looked like they were circling around each other.  Their position in the sky did not change.  We watched it for about a half hour total, and since it wasn&#39;t doing anything different we went to bed.  We are going to see if it&#39;s there again tonight.

I had opened the curtains just incase something like this actually happend. My 4 year old was sick laying on the couch, My wife was holding our 4 months old in her arms sitting in the easy chair. She was facing the TV with her right side to the windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out the windows and noticed a ball of light that was not moving but just sitting in the sky. I&#39;m used to seeing airplanes flying in the sky out that same window.

He had just unlocked his car so my eyes were diverted then I heard him say &#34;What the heck is that&#34; and so I looked up to where he pointed.  I first thought it might be a shooting star but then noticed that the object appeared to be  a line of stars or lights (maybe a comet).  When my eyes focused more closely I noticed that the lights were in the shape of a large V. The lights were of the same intensity as the stars around.  However the lights moved together at great speed and as one object.  There appeared to be four or five lights per side of the triangle.  When my eyes focused on moving object for a second or two, I then noticed that the object had to have great size and mass and was also moving at great speed.  The object was first observed at a nearly overhead position and moved from overhead to the east and into the dull hazed light of the full moon.  I will mention that the sky was completely clear and no clouds.  It was also a complete full moon.  The object moved east and faded into the moonlight within 10 to 15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so excited.  I am 53 years old and a gemologist for over twenty six years.  My eyes are attuned to visual comparisons of light and color on a daily basis.  I know what I saw was not a common plane or object. I am certain that we saw something quite unusual and if not very lucky to view it when we did that it would be very hard to view on a normal basis.  This is because the object blended into the night sky so well and the lights that formed the object matched the starlight intensity exactly.  This object was built to be difficult to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimated that the object traveled over the Seattle area from vertical sighting to the East in 10 to 15 seconds so the entire time over Seattle area was no more than 45 seconds to a minute.  I also live where commercial jets do travel over my house from the south to north route.  The object was 4 to 6 jets in width on each side of the triangle.  That is to say at normal viewing it would take 8 to 12 commercial jets in  width to produce an object that was of the size of the triangle we saw.  Also the lights were white/whitish and NOT blinking green or red.  I do know what this was but I have seen satellites, but not from my house and these lights on the craft were much brighter.  The commercial jets that I see are commonly very easy to hear also.  This object produced no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe this gentleman called NUFORC on the evening of his sighting, and we did not have time to speak with him at length, because of the airing of the ABC program on UFO&#39;s on this date.  We will attempt to contact him<n>

Right underneath my line drawn on the map is an area south of Altus, Arkansas that is a wildlife refuge that borders the river.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A quick drive to that site and some slow cruising along the dirt road just a few dozen yards north of the river resulted in seeing some patches of burnt ground running along next to the road and out into the large open fields north of the road and river. It was while investigating on foot when a local driving up and down the road, and hopping out of his truck to pick up beverage cans and other trash, that I was informed while chatting with him the Army Corp of Engineers had been in the area &#34;a few days ago&#34;{exact time and date uncertain} either doing a controlled burn in the region or fighting the fire. The conversation was hard to follow as his truck was idling noisily and he would not stay in one place to talk with me as he moved back and forth doing his thing, picking up trash from the scorched earth, after I informed him of what was observed from my backyard on Feb. 24th, 2005 between 7 and 8 PM.

Sometimes numerous flashes from at least four other lights, one of which moved slightly from left to right, and a primary that more or less stayed in the same relative position and shone for 2 to 3 seconds, then stayed off for half a minute before repeating until all activity stopped at approximately 19:50 hrs. CST. A bright full moon was rising in the east at the time. Think of orange fireflies winking on and off while hovering in the distance. The distance of these lights from the sighting location is indeterminate. This is the first sighting of unusual lights after 4 years of amateur atronomy on almost every clear night. My personal theory is some kind of bizarre refraction in the atmosphere of either the full moon or car headlights. A clever prank involving model rocketry, modified/homemade fireworks, or radio controlled craft not to be ruled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our special gratitude to the source of the report, given the objective, factual, and apparently accurate nature of what the witness has written above.

I observed three white lights with a single red flashing light in the center of the craft, it was hovering over slightly northeast east of my position, I&#39;m going to guess it was &#34;triangular&#34; due to distance and angle.  This hovering craft, was definitely over Whitby, as I watched it while driving towards to the east.My distance from the object was about 3-4 miles approx.It stayed at a low altitude of 2000-3000 ft.  As I drew closer to it.It started to move off over the eastern Whitby very slow and over western Oshawa ,Ontario.  This one is a new one for me. Could it have been military?  It was that big whatever it was  and even kind of spooky-due to the distant spread of the three white lights. It was definitely not a helicopter, it was way too long, not to mention the lighting sequence. Theruby red light seem to be rotating in flashing. I flashed my head! lights on and off twice, while driving. It appeared to flash back, but not so brightly, there was a difference in its lighting tone. After that happened as I drew closer to it, that&#39;s when it started to move off. Now, other people must have seen this one. Maybe my report on this sighting may be the first one.Hopefully may well not be the last in reporting this sighting. Other witnesses over Whitby and Oshawa must have seen this one as big as it was.This should be report by other who witnessed it . I&#39;m sure if anybody had seen it. They were dumb stricken.PS When I flashed my headlights and slowed down IN MY CAR.Traffic in front of me also slowed down.I&#39;m concluding they too must have witnessed this thing.I was so excited to get home that night to watch Peter Jennings- ABC ~Seeing is Believing ~ Gee, I again witnessed something incredible and unexplainable.I believe each time I witness these unknown aerial anomalies.It creates a wondering obsessive afterthought in question ? ! What the heck was it in timing to see this thing up there !!!~<n>

As we got closer we could see that they were not solid, seemed to swirl and quiver like jello.  Were silverish white but changed to orangish color.   The top object shot straight up into the sky, followed by the other two following slightly slower.  Hovered very high in the sky for a few seconds then slowly started to dim/disappear.  Almost looked like baloons, but moved very fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two other cars on the road that runs parallel to the road that we were on (on the other side of the field).

A few hours after night fall while repairing a water line to the dock at the Marina, my friend ((name deleted)) and I  looked up for no apparent reason and witnessed what I thought at first was a falling star. Just in that moment this object slowed while in a turn, as if it was making a turn. The object did in fact slow and as quickly as it did so, it slug back in the same direct from which it came.  My eye had just lost focus when a second object made the exact move as the one before. Just a little off course than the one before, though much in the same path. It too slug away just as fast as it came to its turning point. I gazed for about an hour or more as my heart palpitated out of control. I was ramped up from this experience. About 30 or 40 minutes after this encounter, aside from telling the other, “We can never say anything to anyone because they’ll think we have lost our marbles”, we listened while tiny pieces scattered around us. In the reeds, one hitting a boat, hitting the water. It was as if a child had thrown a hand full of rocks and the area at which hitting the ground was wide and scattered, though not many. We looked for anything, but it being night we found nothing. During daylight hours the next day, we spent the entire day looking on the surrounding boats for burn marks, indentations, anything, and came up with nothing. I called ((deleted)) and explained the show, he said, &#34;I am watching it now; I&#39;ll call you when over.&#34; We have not, until this point, said anything to anyone. Keep in mind, no flashing or blinking lights, just two separate very small silver like white light ball objects. I am well known in my area and reluctant filling this out, but I will in hope others such as me had the same experience as I. Thank you.<n>

I went into her room and began to rock her back to sleep. As I was rocking her I noticed an engine noise outside. I dismissed it thinking it was my mind playing tricks on me so late at night. Once I got her back to sleep I went back to my room and thought I saw a shadow in the doorway to the bathroom. I got a sudden fear and turned on the lights nothing was there. I again dismissed it thinking it was a shadow. About 3 am my older daughter age 6 came into my room I asked her if she had a bad dream. She said no &#34; there was alians and ghost all around her bed. As she began to tell me the story I asked her if it was a dream she said &#34;no, it was real&#34;, She continued to tell me the story and then started to say it was a dream. I&#39;m am sure this was all just a silly night with our imaginations running wild. But it was enough for me to think about it more then once. Just as an FYI I was not aware of any tv show until the next day when I was telling my friend about it. She asked me if we watched the show. Thinking it was our minds playing tricks. I know this sounds so far fetched to me also. And I can&#39;t believe I am even typing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

Within a minute or so, I noticed a flashing ‘star’ above the tree line of North Hill Puyallup.  As I watched it, it flashed red, blue and white, maybe green once in awhile.  It resembled a star except that it was very low in the sky, much lower than airplanes (Sea-Tac International Airport and Auburn Airport are near the vicinity).  I wasn’t sure if it was moving so I braced myself against the side of the window.  It slowly began to move to the right.  I could tell it was by counting the tree tops, after it moved over the 5th tree, it either lowered or else it was moving further away than I thought and began flashing mainly red and white and the white was extremely bright.  I lowered the binoculars and noticed that I could not see it without them.  I decided to scan the skies above the light and seen two airplanes or else they were two of the ’helicopters&#39; or some type of aircraft we’ve been seeing a lot of for a few months.  These usually flash red and green with a white light -like a headlight in the center and the colored lights are one at either side as if on wings, (these crafts are seen every night in this area and they do not make any noise that I can think of - they fly very low at times but one cannot make out a shape. One night two of them were so low that I thought for an instant that they were street lights and when one of them left the area, it was flying below the roof tops of the businesses across the street from my house!) Anyway, the two airplanes were high above the flashing star and seemed to criss-cross, they were both in the flight path (going opposite directions).  This is when I noticed another very bright flashing light closer to me which was just below the flight path and flashing mainly red and white.  It began jerking back and forth quickly for about 4 seconds and then quickly began to move off to the right, past the cell tower across the street from my house heading for Auburn.  I checked back for the first ’star’ and it was still flashing mainly white very far off.  By this time, it was about 10:08pm, that’s when I went downstairs to write this report.  There has been so much going on in this area (Sumner) for months and we have some pretty incredible video footage shot a few weeks ago out my bedroom window, looking towards the football field.  Actually, we have quite a few stories and good video of at least four sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of five reports from same witness.  PD))<n>

It was flying slowly at about 200 ft. up traveling in a north to south direction. It crossed the street we were traveling on, then stopped and hovered above an empty grocery store location. As we came closer we watched as it turned as if on an axis at a 90 degree turn towards the east. I had rolled my window down to get a clearer look and noticed it made no sound. In excitement we turned into that parking lot as we did so it began moving laterally eastward. We began to follow it, it moved slowly at first, but suddenly accelerated rapidly. We kept chase for about 200 yards, but couldn&#39;t keep up and lost sight of the lights.(object in close vicinity to refinary &amp; tank plant.)<n>

When the lights came across in front of the car, we saw that it was a large triangle the size of a jet liner.  It was gray and the bright lights were lined up along the edges of the triangle.  Right after we saw it, it vanished.  It was pouring rain but didn&#39;t look like it went into the clouds because, as bright as it was, we would have seen the lights shining throught the clouds for at least a few more seconds.  Instead, it simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my mom right then to tell her.

There were 3 lights one red and two white and it was triangular in shape.  I watched it sit there blinking and it did not make a sound or move.  This is not the first time I&#39;ve seen these objects in this area.  They seem to appear quite often and have been on my drive North on this Interstate in this same area for the last couple of months.  I do not see them every week or every day but I do see them frequently and my children have seen them as well.  It is always around the same time of evening when I see them.  There have been times I&#39;ve seen them move and then stop again.  On the night of the 23rd, there were moments when it would disappear and then reappear.  I was trying to be very careful as I was driving and wanted to keep my eyes on the road.  These are not planes and they are not stars.  One time a couple of months ago, I followed one and when I stopped my car to look at it, it took off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report describes self as a public employee, and report is submitted from a government address.

I watched the jet for a few seconds then noticed a bright point of light near the jet. I sat up then stood up and watched the object, then I began taking photos. The object moved north to south in a slight arc, maintaining it&#39;s brightness throughout, from about a ten o&#39;clock position to about a two o&#39;clock position. When I juxtiposed the object with the point of a tree branch, I noticed that it wobbled slightly and had a slightly meandering course. I turned away to notify two passers-by of the object, about two seconds, looked back and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a minute into the sighting I brought the object to the attention of a passerby who watched it with me for a few seconds, commented that we needed binoculars, then proceeded up the pathway. Later upon his return I offered to exchange contact info with him that he may corroborate this sighting and he refused. His opinion was that it was a mylar weather ballon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have approximately ten photos of the object and some contain a second faint object that I did not see at the location of the sighting. When I zoom in on the object with my photo editing program I can see dark areas around the object that change from photo to photo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Aprox 3:30am<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw blinking intense amber light that I first mistook for a planet. After looking back to the sky I noticed it had moved a drastic amount in the sky. I put my head on the windowsill to keep my head steady and noticed it move from a static position to a constant velocity for maybe 3 seconds and then stop with no acceleration/deceleration. It was snowing that night (the light was intense compared to streetlamps around it), but I thought that I could make out a feint circular shape. I have been fascinated with flight since I was young and I have never heard/seen of any aircraft moving like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I called a friend, an amateur stargazer, who lives about 2 miles away, and he was also able to see it both with the naked eye and with the aid of 7x35 bincoulars.

It was a very cold, snowy night..visability was very limited. My brother and myself were headed home from my job. As we came to the intersection of Rt 11 and Guy Young Rd we noticed what appeared to be a VERY low flying airplane off to the east over where we guessed at the time by the visibility to be Oneida lake. As we came to the stop light we noticed that the craft was moving very slowly..At first all we saw were three lights in a triangle formation. No blinking lights, no red beacon lights..just these three lights one in the front two in the back. My brother rolled down his window, and due to the lack of traffic or noise we realized how strange it was that we coul her nothing, no engine, no blades from a helicopter, nothing. Finding this strange we came to a complete stop in the middle of the street &amp; got out of the van...there was a low hanging fog in the area coming off of the lake and hanging approx. 200 ft above the water..We watched as the craft passed right above our heads but lower than the cloud cover...We both clearly saw the craft as a black triangle shaped vehicle with one light at the front tip and one at each of the two back tips. It was travelling slowly...very slowly..if the weather hadnt been so bad i would have said it was a hangglider, but there was no way in that cold and that snow that it was a hanglider..I saw no wings it was a solid triangle. it was moving much to slwly to even be in the air.. As we approached the bridge going over the lake the craft was about 100 ft or less above our heads, no sound, like it was coasting through the air....i continued to wtch and listen with all the windows down creeping along very slowly so we could hear anything, we heard nothing...As we crested the bridge the veh moved off to our left side and suddenly shot straight up through the clouds, not at an angle but straight up...and again...no sound......My background is a call center rep for an emergency road service company and my brother is a carpet installer...I am still freaked out when i think back.....it was like yesterday....<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/22/05 21:30|Eugene|OR|Unknown|3 minutes|Unidentified government craft over Eugene?|2/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42112.html|71|ndxe200502| Unidentified government craft over Eugene?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home at about 9:30 PM on 22 February 2005, and I was only a minute or two away from being home. I saw in the medium distance, maybe a mile away at most, what looked like two streetlights in the northeast, only higher up in the air. Two amber-ish/off white colored lights. They didn&#39;t seem to be moving very fast, and I was trying to keep my eye on them off and on while I was driving. I didn&#39;t think much of it, because they could be helicopters or some kind of normal aircraft, so I was just mildly curious. I drove into my driveway and got out of the car and waited to see if I could see the lights again. At this point they were obscured by some taller trees in our neighborhood. Eventually one came over our neighborhood- not directly overhead but nearly- and I got a pretty decent look at it. Let me say first that there was not anything other-worldly about this, it followed the &#34;rules&#34; and physics a normal kind of aircraft would, but at the same time it didn&#39;t match up with anything I&#39;ve seen or heard before. It flew at the approximate altitude and speed I would expect a helicopter to fly at, not very fast, but not unusually slow either. In any case, it was not at the altitude of a commercial airliner. The prominent, constant bright light on the craft obscured my vision of the actual shape/texture of the craft, being that it was night. If it had wings, there were no lights on them. On what I interpreted to be the side of the craft, there were small lights with a repeating pattern, very similar to what I&#39;ve seen before on registered aircraft. I believe one was red, the others might have been white or blue. I don&#39;t remember how many of these smaller lights there were. No more than three. I believe the pattern was two-step in that one pattern flashed followed by a slightly different pattern, and then the entire sequence repeated. The entire sequence didn&#39;t take longer than two seconds to complete. Again, it was much like the patterns I&#39;ve seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, the only thing that did not cause me to dismiss this as a helicopter was the sound. There was no loud, rotary sound. It sounded very much like the sound of a distant commercial airliner, the kind of low-frequency-air-jet kind of sound, only very subdued. It wasn&#39;t nearly as loud as I would expect for an aircraft flying at the altitude of this craft. Hearing this kind of sound with a low-flying, slow-flying craft did not make any sense in my mind. Again, the sound itself was not particularly unusual, but in the context of what I was seeing, it seemed very unusual. The craft progressed toward the southwest, toward our downtown. And the second craft followed in a similar direction about 20-30 seconds later. As far as I could tell, the craft were identical, and they flew at the same altitude and speed. The entire sighting from the time I first saw the two lights in the medium distance to the time they were out of my sight was probably no more than four minutes. Possibly a little less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To follow-up the sighting I called one of our local TV stations about an hour later, and they had received no calls about odd aircraft. The next day, Wednesday, I called the air traffic controller tower at the Eugene Airport, and the representative there said she was not aware of any government or military aircraft flying over Eugene the night before. My best guess is that these were military craft, but they resembled nothing I have seen in the past.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a nearly full moon and very clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor, we believe, but please see other reports for this date.  PD))<n>
2/22/05 20:10|Nanaimo (Canada)|BC|Oval|10 minutes|Two bright, large pill shaped objects fly very quickly across the sky, hover and then slowly fade until gone.|2/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42075.html|73|ndxe200502| Two bright, large pill shaped objects fly very quickly across the sky, hover and then slowly fade until gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I had just got coffee and were walking downtown. We had to wait at the busy streetlights to cross, and while we stood around for the light to change, I looked up in the sky and there was a bright, kind of pill shaped object rising out of the horizon to the north (or so?) and it was getting what seemed very close very quickly. I know very well what a regular plane looks like flying at night, and it wasn&#39;t like that. There were no individual lights or colours; it seemed more like an ambient orange-red-yell-white strip of colour. At first, I thought it was an illuminated blimp, but it was moving what seemed very quickly and I don&#39;t think one could have gone so fast. I yelled to my friend, who also saw and was shocked. For a moment I felt extremely afraid, because I thought it might be a burning aircraft or meteor headed our way. It got to be about the size of an eraser on the end of a pencil, before it stopped and seemed to not move at all for about 10 or 20 seconds. Then, it started moving south (we were facing the east, towards the harbour), much slower than before. It kept moving until it was south and lower in the sky than the moon, about the four o&#39;clock position of the moon. We thought it was immobile again, until we realized that it had moved up a tiny bit, but now was getting very slowly smaller and smaller. My friend yelled something, and I turned to see another one come zooming up exactly where the other had been. It seemed brighter and bigger than the first one, but travelled the exact same path as the former, albeit a bit faster. The colours were also a little more distinguishable - mostly what looked like overlapping orange and yellow white, with bits of red. it moved accross the sky until it was about a thumb&#39;s length away from the first one, which now could be mistaken for another star in the sky, were it not for its bright red (almost Mars-like) colour and the fact it was still fading away. Then the second flying thing also began to move up a little, and fade out of site. Soon, the first one had completely vanished, and about two minutes later (we stood and watched the entire thing) the last one too became smaller and smaller and more and more red-coloured, and it also went out like a tiny red star. Really weird. There were plenty of other people downtown that night, so maybe other people saw it too. I have seen lots of different things in the sky but nothing like that - nothing so bright or large. Or something so big move so quickly, and seemingly low (but it was very difficult to tell just how faw away it was).<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was mostly a clear evening with some clouds to the east and some moving in from the west in the distance of  the highway I was traveling north bound on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was at about at the 15-20 mile mark south of the town in live in I noticed a weird sight  in the sky on the west side of the highway. I have always been  interested in aircraft and very much in touch with the sky and those things that occupy it.  I had seen the moon hang really low in the sky before in this part of the country and first thought it was weird for it to be out and so low this soon in the evening so I started staring  at it.  It looked like a planet or rock just suspended  in the sky and as I stared ,it appeared to begin moving upward and just when I started thinking it could be the moon rising or something of a rational reason it rotated and a reflection of light from the setting sun bounced off of what appeared to be a bronze window or panel part of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept staring at it and trying to keep my vehicle in my lane while watching this thing as long as I can and every time I looked at the road in front of me and return my attention back to where it was just a few seconds ago, I had to find it again because it had moved higher each time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was excited and also trying to reason as to why it would be hear and then I realized that it was directly east of the nuclear power plant that was about 10-15 miles west of me and the highway I was on. It was as though the plant was being observed. It rose up without a sound vapor trail or anything and within a minute or so it was completely out of sight, straight up.<n>

Living in Cincinnati I am used to seeing lights in the sky at night, but this one just sat there! I pulled my car over so I could get out and look, and watched for about three of four minutes. Finally it began to slowly move about and then it just vanished. I don&#39;t know if I am the only one who saw it or not, but I sure hope not. It could not have been a plane. Do you know what the light could have been? I would love to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I work at the Radisson Resort Parkway in Kissimmee, FL. I was on the 8th floor of the hotel and was looking out threw a glass window from a hotel room. I noticed a fast moving spheric metalic object that was streeking threw the ski. It was moving quickly at first, and then slowed down. It was pretty big and couldn&#39;t distinghuish it from any other aircraft I&#39;ve seen before. It was not a balloon, it did not fly erraticly like balloons do. It flew in a vetical, controled speed, and at the same altitude. It never floated higher as balloons do. Weird!!! How the hell does one make a round metal ball fly?!?!?<n>

USA at 9:30pm EST|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42117.html|99|ndxe200502| Saw triangular shaped, black object with greenish lights, on 2/19/05, in De. USA at 9:30pm EST<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home after work, approx. 9:30 est, heading west. I had seen unusual looking lights pretty far out to the southwest; they caught my eye, and i sort of kept an eye on them, off/on for a few miles. They had an unusual shape/were sort of a greenish tint. There were a few cars on the road with me for awhile. As I neared home, all the cars I had been traveling with left the road, and I was alone traveling west, about 3-4 min. from home. The area I live in is in the country, but not desolate. There are quite a few homes, separated by fields/large lots. There was almost a full moon.  As i approached an intersection, suddenly the lights seemed to come right toward me,fast,then slowed down and went right across the road, in front of me,about 20 or 30 feet above the road,and then stopped and hovered above a field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a section of trees about 30 or 40 feet high running parallel to the field.The trees hid most of the craft;when it went into the field, an incredibly bright light flashed for about a minute or so.The craft seemed to turn around. I could see enough from where i stopped to see that. It was like a greenish white huge, oblong shaped light...as bright as a laser. I didnt know what to do. I was petrified and thought that if i went forward, God knows what would happen to me. So i pulled up into a driveway that was nearby. Two houses were there with their lights out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my lights/radio off and tried to sit very still. The light went out and the craft lifted slowly up over the trees toward me. i looked up and saw underneath the  craft. It moved very slowly. It was black and triangular shaped with a rounded sort of nose. It was about 60 feet wide.with green lights spaced equal distances apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were lines, black lines underneath. It hovered over me for about 5 min, mabey less. It didnt make any sound at all. Finally, it moved slowly on toward the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it go for a few minutes and then got the courage to tear out of there and go home. I have been unable to get the images out of my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so scared/in utter disbelief at what was happening that i put the car into reverse andbacked up without looking.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

While returning inside I looked up most unsuspectingly just to have a glimpse of the shiny half moon. In front of the moon, the twin stars of Constellation Gemini – Castor and Pollux were shining while a brighter Saturn was beside the pair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the last moment of my glance, I suddenly viewed something very unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could very, very clearly watch a tiny star-like reddish-brown dot resembling the reddish-orange star &#34;Pollux.&#34; The dot flew past Saturn and Constellation Gemini that contained &#34;Pollux&#34; itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I put a most careful attention towards the particular point of the sky. The tiny dot of reddish light slightly diverted its path and continued moving smoothly, faster than a plane but much slower than any shooting star. The ‘red dot’ reached a nearby region possibly that of Constellation Cancer and apparently vanished. Please note that the red dotted light did not blink or quiver but was a fixed dot of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could it be a satellite or some kind of space junk ? Or was it some real UFO ? I am truly amazed to be able to witness a couple of strange sightings in the night sky within a single week !<n>

I should say that I&#39;m a college student who has studied Astronomy throughout high school and college, so I feel I&#39;m a pretty observant person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last Saturday, February 19th, at around 2:35 PM, I was sitting at a traffic light when I just decided to look up at the sky since it was such a gorgeous day, not a cloud in sight whatsoever.  I looked over to my left, which would be looking north, when I noticed an object in the sky at about 45 degrees elevation to my line of sight.  It was greyish in color and cigar-shaped, and was traveling at quite a brisk pace; if I had to estimate the speed in relation to a car on the ground, I would say about 30 miles per hour.  If I had to estimate the size of the object, I would say it was about the diameter of a quarter if held at arm&#39;s length.  I would estimate the elevation to be 500 feet above the ground at the most.  If memory serves me right, this would make this a right isosceles triangle, meaning that the distance on the ground between myself and the object was about 500 feet.  I feel this is about right.  The object also seemed to be &#34;hazy&#34; - it would best be related to heat fog that one sees when looking down a tarmac road on a hot day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first noticed the object, it was traveling west, parallel to the direction my car was facing at the traffic light.  I was looking out to the north, and my car was facing the east.  I was intrigued by it because it was definitely not a helicopter, because it was flat, and did not have any rotar blades.  I see a lot of helicopters in this area, and even if they are as far away from me as this one was, I can hear noise, but this made no sound.  I got the impression that it was not way far away in the distance, but was close.  After watching it for several seconds, I looked ahead to see if the traffic light had changed, and upon seeing that it was still red, I looked back to where the object was traveling, where it should have been had it continued along the same path, only to find that it was gone.  Just gone.  Surprised, I looked around the sky intently, thinking that it might have changed direction.  I still could not find it, and I never saw it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling in the middle of the sky when I noticed it, and I only took my gaze away from it for 2 seconds, so I have no idea where it could have gone in that time if it really was just a plane or helicopter.  I spent the next 15 seconds before the traffic light changed looking all over the sky, just in case it had disappeared due to the sun&#39;s reflection, but I still could not find it.  I would argue this was possibly a conventional airplane, except I cannot get over the fact of how a conventional aircraft could disappear that fast.  There were no trees it could have disappeared behind, nor any cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It appeared to be a fireball in the sky, as we were driving North on hwy 44, going towards Eustis, I glimpsed over to the East of the Van, and witnessed this bright orange glow, it was way too big to be any typical aircraft, or an explosion. There was no sound, and I&#39;m very sure that this was not a weather balloon, or anything of the sorts. I immediatly got my mothers attention, and she saw the same thing that I was seeing, so I&#39;m very sure we weren&#39;t hallucinating.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked to be on the otherside of the mountain range which is about 9500 ft. there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediatly after I saw it I killed the light&#39;s on my vehicle and drove to a parking lot up the road where I could get a better view.  I watched it for about 15 minutes it would hover for a couple of minutes then move left or right a little, it had light&#39;s flashing on it that would flash in differnt repertion&#39;s of Blue, Red, Green, and White, at times all light&#39;s would stay on.  During that 15 minutes I had turned my headlight&#39;s on to take off and all light&#39;s on the craft immdiatly turned off after my light&#39;s had been on for 10 seconds,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then drove back down the street out of view then came back with my light&#39;s off and parked again.  About a minute passed and the light&#39;s came on again on the craft.  I decided to a county road that circles around and comes back to town, the road that I took also cut&#39;s off and goes in the mountain close to where I saw it at.  As I turned off on the county the light&#39;s still flashed until a little after I topped a hill where my light&#39;s where easily seen in the sky, after that the light&#39;s never came on again on the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came home and then about 30 minutes later one fighter jet possiblly a F-18 (wingspan didn&#39;t look like a f-16 th only other jet they fly here) flew about a block or two away from my house coming from a straight from where I saw the light&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light&#39;s on the craft I saw that night didn&#39;t flash at the same rate it varied from somewhere of .20 - 1.0 seconds, it could of been a helicopter I couldn&#39;t see a shape because it was so far away, but there are several lavish ranches on the other side of the mountain&#39;s just about where the lights was at.  The airforce does do training flights here occasionally but I&#39;ve never seen just one flying that time of night, they alway&#39;s have another jet within a couple mile radius and which there was none others that I could see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It could not have been a star or planet in the sky as what I saw was bigger and brighter than the rest of the objects in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Lat/Long for the general area I saw it at is 37.25&#39;N  105.12&#39;W, it is not a tower, the closest one to that area is about 5 miles which is a repetitor tower which has no light on it.  In my best opinion the craft was about 1000 ft above the ground based on visual referance with surrounding mountains, the town here is viturally asleep or no one comes out after 23:00 at night untill about about 6:00 in the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at the star, Sirius.  It gives off vivid color, and it is very bright.  Its chromatic nature would be reduced, it the observer were at a higher elevation.  PD))<n>

There was four lights in a somewhat square pattern that was redish orange in color that dimmed out one by one to the NW sky. My wife had turned around just as the last couple had faded out. Than withen mabey 10 to 15 secounds another cluster of lights appared again directley West that began as just one light turning into what looked like mabey 4 or more in a somewhat jagged line, that again dimmed out one by one.(BTW the sky was clear on this night) My wife ran in the house to get her parents as we couldent beleve or figure out what we were seeing. Just as my wife,son &amp; her mother had came back outside one more single light was seen to the high SW part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was also quite a few normal aircraft flying in random back &amp; forth patterns aroung the area of sightings. At first I thought what we were seeing was some kind of lighting from the aircraft, but the type of lighting we saw &amp; the way it faded out was unlike anything my wife or I have seen before. I would decribe it as a small ball of fire, slowly lighting than slowly burning out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It has been driving me nuts ever since we had seen it, as until finding this web site I havent heard of anyone else anywhere in or around Kokomo that has seen it. But from what a person in Peru IN decribes it would be the same lights we had seen &amp; was also the same night.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We watched the lit object for about 20 seconds, and then it zipped away with no sound. I do mean &#34;zipped&#34;. No aircraft can hover in the air and take off and away at the speed we witnessed. There was no gradual speed, but instant speed. And then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then all dropped our jaws and realized that we had witnessed something we&#39;d never seen before.<n>

Very Strange- and would&#39;ve thought my mind was playing tricks if my 8 year old hadn&#39;t seen it to.  I am a professional and I AM NOT making this up!  I would love for someone to tell me what this was!!  The other wierd thing was a truck was coming rom the opposite direction and his lights kept flashing on and off, don&#39;t know if he/she was trying to get my attention or if it was electrical interference?  No trouble with my vehicle though.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Please read below.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Longitude: 116.7 W, Latitude: 36.9 N I&#39;m a commercial pilot for United Airways, Flight 17.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took off from Las Vegas International towards Los Angeles International. I called control, asked clearance for &#34;sierra-tango-one-seven&#34; and got a &#34;runway clearance&#34; over the radio. Now, because of the Earth&#39;s rotational pattern, we move NW then SW towards LA. If we go directly SEE, we&#39;ll end up chasing Los Angeles around the globe. So I was heading that way when suddenly I saw 7 arrowheard shaped crafts darting away in aerospace above me. Now, I was a bit interested so I guess I became careless. I diverted off course towards the north, chasing the aircraft. I was able to maintain a speed pretty close to the aircrafts. I was heading when control started radioing, &#34;United 17, you are diverting off course. Return to navigational trajectory or we will take defensive action.&#34; I didn&#39;t respond. What would I have said? Would I say, &#34;Hold on control. I&#39;m chasing some UFOs&#34;? No. So after control repeated the phrase, I turned off the radio. Now, they said they were going to take defensive action so I&#39;m looking around. I see a base on the ground. I look on the map, and it&#39;s Nellis AFB. I see a gleam on the runway and next thing I know, an interceptors flying right in front of me. Now after 9/11, NORAD did some reforms. All commercial pilots were told that if an interceptor drops flares in front of you, it means NORAD ordered it to destroy you unless you contact control within one minute and tell them what you&#39;re doing. Now, this interceptor starts dropping flares all over the place. I contacted local Air Traffic Control over the frequencies, 121.5 and 243.0. I said, &#34;I have an F-16 in front of me. Its side reads india-one-oh-seven. It&#39;s trying to take me down. I have visual confirmation of seven UFOs.&#34; Air traffic controller comes back on line and says, &#34;I copy that, sierra-tango-one-seven. Keep in visual range of UFOs until NORAD can send interceptors. I repeat, stay in visual range. For now, follow the ICAO signals from the interceptor. We will advise interceptor to not attack.&#34; I reply, &#34;Thank you control.&#34; I&#39;m following and three jets appear. They shoot out after the plane. I go back on the course trajectory. I landed at LAX at 0853. I had an interrogation with generous hosts from FAA. They made sure I&#39;m not a &#34;spy working for terrorist causes&#34;. Now, I submit this form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Remember that I am a highly trained commercial pilot and I know what I&#39;m writing about. The other witness was my co-pilot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We doubt that this is a serious report.  The witness elects to remain anonymous, and many of the facts he/she cites above don&#39;t appear to conform to reality, we believe.  Most commercial a/c cannot transmit on 243.0 mhz frequency, since frequencies in that range are reserved for military aircraft.  Also, we can find no &#34;United Airways&#34; in Nevada.  There appear to be other irregularities in the story, as well.  PD))<n>
2/18/05 04:00|Collinsville|IL|Triangle|10 minutes|Triangular aircraft with bright white light hovered silently over houses.|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44353.html|115|ndxe200502| Triangular aircraft with bright white light hovered silently over houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work along the south frontage road that parallels I-70 near Troy, IL.  It was approx. 0400 in the am and I was traveling east at a speed of 35-40 mph.  I always drive slowly at that hour since it is prime time for certain wildlife on the roads (deer, raccoon, possums, rabbits).  There were only a few cars and trucks on the interstate and my husband was following in a vehicle behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I hit the crest of a hill offering a panoramic view, my peripheral vision caught sight of a very bright white light in the north sky to the left and ahead of me.  It was moving slowly toward the south and would eventually intersect the interstate and the frontage road on which I was traveling.  I could not see the craft at this time, only the bright light as it moved through the dark sky.  At certain times of the month, this is a flight path for Lambert airport in St. Louis, Mo (I travel this road frequently).  I assumed it was a plane and drove on, returning my full attention to the road.  A couple more minutes up the road the white light again attracted my interest.  It now seemed somewhat larger in the sky, since we were closing distance.  I could now notice both a red and a blue light beneath the level of the white one.  The red light was blinking.  I realized that the craft had to be too low in the sky for a plane and that it was traveling too slowly.  I remember thinking that it must be a helicopter, but my brain did not seem to fully accept this idea because the relative sizes (positions) of the lights seemed to indicate that they were not lined up in a lateral fashion but instead were indicative of greater depth.  (Amazing how fast a brain can assess and conclude!)  But then it must be a helicopter, what else could it be?  I returned my attention to the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I came to the place where a side road joins the two frontage roads and the interstate overpass crosses above.  I am always very careful here.  This is a spot where accidents tend to occur due to a very short visual field created by the interstate embankment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly and surprisingly, I caught sight of lights above my van and to the right.  There was a large craft hovering above the houses near the end of the residential lane just ahead and to the south.  There was illumination from nearby street lights.  Regarding its width, it seemed to stretch across at least two roofs.  It was grey in color and triangular in shape.  Judging by the houses and the trees it was only about 400 or 500 feet above the ground.  It was not moving at this time.  My windows were up, the radio was off.  You can easily hear the sound of cars as they pass on the interstate, but this craft was completely silent.  I was trying to lean over the steering wheel to look up and still look ahead to avoid going off the road.  There was no shoulder to pull off on so my viewing of the craft at this close range was intermittent and consisted of short bursts.  I remember thinking, “Is that military?”  (This sighting occurred approx. fifteen miles from Scott Air Force Base.)  It reminded me of the pictures I have seen on TV of stealth bombers, but my understanding is that they cannot hover.  It also reminded me of harrier jets, and although they can hover I thought they emitted an enormous amount of noise.  I was bewildered and trying to reach the cell phone in my purse to call my husband and ask if he was seeing this too.  This juggling proved too difficult and I decided to continue on and stop at the church parking lot several hundred yards ahead.  I said, “Did you see that?” To which he responded, “See what?”  (My husband does not generally look at the sky and additionally was tired from a long day at work.  He did not see the craft as he was preoccupied watching my taillights, assuming that I had come to a near-stop due to an animal ahead on the roadway.)  I pointed to the craft still hovering but having shifted just slightly south.  From this new vantage point, the craft itself was too far to be clearly seen but the red and blue lights were visible beyond a deciduous tree line (no leaves on the trees).  No other lights were noted from this angle.  My husband could see the lights and was in agreement on the estimation of height.  Then the craft began to move southwesterly over the fields of a rural area.  I got back in the van and we traveled along a south road with the intention of intersecting it again on the next west road so my husband could see the underside of it.  But to our amazement the craft picked up an incredible amount of speed and while we watched, disappeared rapidly into the southwestern sky past the city lights of Collinsville toward St. Louis, covering at least 20 miles in about two minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the initial sighting of the white light to the moment the colored lights of the underside were gone from sight was approx. 10 minutes duration, although direct viewing of the craft itself from underneath lasted only about 30 seconds.<n>

We left the area both freaked out we never thought about telling anyone for the fear of sounded crazy, until a friend of ours told us about this web site, I have never seen any thing like that in my life and I hope I never do again!

I actually saw a plain fly right underneath it, the airplain look much smaller than &#34;the blue light&#34; the lights on the plain were flashing as it usually looks, and the blue light right above the plain was steady and much larger.

I went for my camera and tried to take a digital photo but it only shows a white light in the distance before it was comletely out of sight.

It was just before dark; but still very much daytime.  I did not have to turn on my halogen head lights.  I looked into the sky at what I first assumed to be an aircraft flying over.  However, I notice that this craft(s) lights were not the normal pattern of an aircraft.  These very, very, intense halogen appearings would almost burn out one by one, still appearing to move in the air.  Once they would burn out.  I couldn&#39;t see any solid shape and I heard no noise.  After all the lights disppeared, I continue to search the skyline and after another minute I just saw one light again and it slowly burned out again.  I reported a similar incident in this county approximately 1 year ago about 12-15 miles outside of this city.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/17/05 18:00|Tucker|GA|Formation|25 seconds|Group of sporadic flashing lights traveling across the sky on feb 17 in Tucker Georgia|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42116.html|123|ndxe200502| Group of sporadic flashing lights traveling across the sky on feb 17 in Tucker Georgia<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading out my works door at about 6-ish maybe a little bit before that and noticed a very stange formation up in the sky.  Basically what I saw was a group of intermintent lights that had no distinct shape traveling very high up in the sky together.  It was almost like flares that were lighting and then extinguishing or perhaps mirrors reflecting the sunsrays.  One thought that I had was that somebody had done a balloon releases and used those silver reflective balloons.  I don&#39;t know what direction the wind was blowing and they would have been moving at speeds comparable to that of an jet aircraft and they were traveling much higher than any commercial airplanes in the area.  You could see the clouds and sky in between the lights but still the lights traveled small group.  Also there were no strangling lights, all the lights appeared and disappeared within that group.  One very strange thing about this is that I could not see the lights without my sunglasses on.  At first when I saw the objects in the sky I thought that I had scratched my sunglasses.  When I took the sunglasses off and could not see the formation and had to put them back on to locate it again.  I tested this a few times.  It definately was not scratched sunglasses.  I did take a picture with my cell phone, well actually two pictures but I can&#39;t really see much on my cell phone and I&#39;m not sure exactly how I am suppose to email them to myself.  Also at some point while I was watching this thing cross the sky, at one point about 7 lights lined very distinctly on the front of the flying group.  That was really the only patter I saw.

2/17/05 17:08|Louisville|KY|Other|55minutes|The cloud in the sky observed for aproximately 5 to 6 minutes suddenly disappeared with a minute.|2/22/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42021.html|124|ndxe200502| The cloud in the sky observed for aproximately 5 to 6 minutes suddenly disappeared with a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking my daily evening walk  in a slight Northeastward direction in the student parking lot of the Southwest campus College  at which I am a professor of ((subject deleted)). It was a clear evening with a nice blue sky. There was a breeze that was blowing out of the west. The only clouds noted where behind me a little above the south-west horizon. The sun was to the rear left of me at about approximately 7:00 of due south at an elevation of approximately 60 degrees above the horizon. The northwest and northeast sky in front of and above me was totally devoid of any clouds except for, I noticed one solid white slight puffish at the top and whispy on the bottom appearing as lopsided square shaped STATIONERY white cloud approximately the size of a piece of paper 8x11 held at arms length. It was at approximately 1:00 of due north and approimately 45 to 60 degrees overhead above the horizon. I thought this was very strange the cloud being the only cloud in this sector of the sky and stationery. It did not touch the ground. There were some students walking about the parking lot at that busied going to and leaving classes. None seeming to notice the phenomena and I didn&#39;t bother about asking them to note the cloud. I kept watching the cloud for about 5 to 6 minutes and suddenly to my astonishment the cloud began to fade going from a white to a smoky looking brown then total disapperance in less than a minute. It expanded some what in size before disapearing. A few minutes later slightly to the bottom left at slight a distance from where the cloud was a slight glimmer from what looked like a silver BB.  About 30 minutes later a manila colored helicopter with a long rounded fuselage with red and blue stripes maybe on the crew cab, appeared from the east and flew near where the cloud was but lower, then it flew west, then south, then north,  then, east in a circle several times and then flew off southward. First I thought it was a medivac copter that sometimes lands at the hospital located east of campus. Strangely a copter did land there later but it was green and had a shorter fuselage. At approximately  17:50 upon the second circumvention of my walk I noticed further north beyond where the cloud and where the silver shiny looking BB were, against the blue sky, an object appearing as a  silver slim roundish fountain pen held at double arms length was hovering about 45 degrees it apeared above the horizon. This could have been an airliner. There is an airport in that vacinity. Coincidently, in reference to the cloud I observed it seemed to have hovered over where I had read in an earlier report about an observer who said he had seen an object in a field about the size of three football field somewhere around the Palatka Road area here in Louisville. The most outstanding, astonishing and startling obsevation regarding this report though is the sudden diappearance of the cloud completely within a minute. My questions are: has anyone else ever seen an ocurrence such as this and/or is there an explanation for this strange phenmomena that I saw. Then too, every cloud we see may not be JUST an ordinary cloud. Perhaps some type of camouflaging agent for an object or objects??? Weather conditions I took later from the weather station here from off of the internet as follows : some clouds, visibilty clear, Temp 31 degrees,  Humidity 45%, Barometric Pressure 30.24 and wind speed at 20 miles per hour  Thankyou.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The thing that made me question whether it was an airplane or not is that the craft had no blinking lights, was a very odd dark bright blue color that seemed unatural, it was almost blending in with the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came from the distance first moving like an airplane, then it moved uncharacteristically of an airplane, it changed directions very fast and erractically.  What happend next made me feel uneasy, it accellerated so fast it went accross the sky and literally disapeared, just shot across the sky faster than any plane i&#39;ve ever seen.  The whole time i heard not a thing, and whenever something is that close i always hear it, except this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

2/17/05 13:30|Nashville|TN|Circle|2min 25sec|Pilot sees a Circular object hover and then goes to speed in one second, goes half mile and hovers again.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42251.html|126|ndxe200502| Pilot sees a Circular object hover and then goes to speed in one second, goes half mile and hovers again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing outside behind my house watching the hawks fly around when I noticed a jet fly over.  Being a Commercial Pilot I am always drawn to watch them fly over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was watching the jet a object to the jets left caught my eye.  By the way I have 20/15 in one eye and 20/20 in the other.  This object was circular in shape and appeared to be at least 500 ft to 2000 ft AGL depending on its size, which was hard to to determine. If it was 500ft it was around the size of a washing machine, if it was 2000 ft it was around the size of a truck or van.  It was a color between orange and gold in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This single object was hovering above the hill behind my house.  It would move side to side, no more than three or four times its width to each side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought, Ok, I am seeing a hawk at a high altitude flying around in a tight circle but it wasn&#39;t a circle it was side to side.  I thought to myself a hawk isn&#39;t round or gold nore can it fly side to side so what is that?  About that time T-0 to T+20 sec. at T-20 it stopped and was completely still and remained frozen hovering there from T-20 until T-40 in between that time I rubbed my eyes to make sure there wasn&#39;t something in them.  There wasn&#39;t because I noticed it was still there frozen in the sky.  It seemed to glisten once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had a tree and a hill as a reference point as I am aware of the fact that without them objects can appear to move.  Anyway from around T-40 to T-60sec it started moving back and forth again.  Then from T-60 to T-80 it stopped and was frozen hovering there again in the same spot as the previous times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime around T-80 it accelerated from velocity V-0mph to its full observed speed of what I later estimate conservatively 180mph within one second V-180mph.  So T-80 to T-81 and V-0 to V-180.  OK?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it move and pass behind the tall tree behind the house that doesn&#39;t have any leaves so I could still see it and it went at the same speed and altitude over to another hill that is over a half a mile away and stop/hover.  When it stopped it seemed to slow from V-180 to V-0 at a slower rate than it accelerated not by much though but it was a noticeable difference, my guess is 2 or 3 seconds V 180 to V-0.  It flew from point A to point B in less than ten seconds which are the basis for my speed estimates.  T-80 through T-90.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the object was higher than I estimate, then the distance and speed would be much more than I estimated.  Anyway it stopped over the second hill and hovered there for another 20 seconds T-90 to T-110.  Then it moved back and forth again ,T-110 to T-130sec, and stopped frozen hovering there for about ten seconds T-130 to T-140.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around this time it flew pretty much dew south from point B with the same type of velocity as before V-0 to V whatever speed ( fast ! )in one second and went out of my sight over the horizon of hills to the south which took around 5 seconds so T-140 to T-145sec.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I called KBNA ATC and talked to the controler on duty the day before.  He was interested in my sighting but said that he hadn&#39;t noticed anything strange on radar that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have flown privately and commercially for twenty years and am aware of all known aircraft and this was not one of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a BS degree in Aerospace and with a minor in Psychology.  I am 37 years old.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.<n>

Getting closer i realized that these lights were not moving or blinking.  So I new it was not a plane.  When I got to where I needed to turn to go to work I pulled into the parking lot where the aircraft was hovering.  Then when looking at the ship closer and trying to get a better understanding of it, it started flying away from me. It didnt fly to fast but quick enough to get from where I was.  There was no noise and there were 3 lights on it in a triangle form.  It didnt disappear just maybe went about 5 miles easst of where I was, and got there in maybe 20 sec. Then I had to go to work before I was late. Creepy and weird.  I believe it to be nothing else but a ufo.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/17/05 01:38|Minneapolis/St. Paul|MN||over 10 minutes|stable tapered vertical light in sky|2/22/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41992.html|128|ndxe200502| stable tapered vertical light in sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night I got out of bed ~1:30 to fetch my girlfriend a snack (poached egg on toast; chocolate pudding).  Upon returning to our bedroom I looked out the window and saw a vertical streak of light starting just above the tree line and extending perhaps 10 - 15 degrees into the sky.  The streak of light started narrow, got slightly wider and brighter in the middle and then narrowed again. It was symetric both vertically and horizontally. The light was a whitish/greening/blueish color, akin to some northern lights displays I have seen.  However, it did not shimmer / wave as northern lights do.  It did however slowly fade and brighten repeatedly.  We both watched it for about 15 minutes before going back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky had a fairly uniform cloud cover.  Dark spots moved accross the sky slowly, but it was not clear if these were darker clouds, or openings in the clouds exposing dark night (I suspect the latter).  Regardless, the spots passed behind the light causing no change in relative brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We could not judge the distance of the light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We live in Minneapolis on Seabury Ave., which is directly on the Mississippi River.  The light was about 5 degrees SE of the Prospect Park &#34;witches hat&#34; watertower:<n> <n><n> <n><n> (http://www.pperr.org/history/thetower.html).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Checking a map to confirm the vector, I judge the light to have been somewhere along the line running through the intersection of University Ave. / Emerald St. and the centerpoint of the University of Minnesota&#39;s School of Agriculture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light reminded my girlfriend of another odd light dispaly she saw years ago with a friend: three bars of stable verticle light each of which were truncated squarely on both the top and bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Go figure.<n>

The craft we saw did not make any noise. This craft appeared to be very big.   My wife witnessed it, but she said she saw a circle of red light atached beneath the triangle. The event lasted about one minute. This is the first time in our lifes that either of us have ever seen a UFL up close.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Douglas Golf Course), my brother and I were returning to our car when to the east approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and 10 - 15 km away we witnessed what looked like a plane (typical cylindrical shape) flying in a southerly direction towards the Olympic Mountains. Obviously a plane flying along the Straight of Georgia in a path towards Seattle is normal, however the &#39;plane&#39; was quite low in the sky (approximately 2000m) AND HAD ANOTHER CRAFT VERY CLOSE IN FRONT AND ABOVE THE NOSE OF THE PLANE SEEMINGLY GUIDING IT. The secondary craft was small...circular and white and it was approximately 50-100 metres in front and above the nose of what I believed to be a plane. For the duration of the event, the secondary craft remained at the same distance from the &#39;plane&#39; except for a brief moment when the gap seemed to close...this may be due to a quick manouvre to the southeast; however the original distance between the two craft was soon recovered. After observing the craft for a few minutes, the craft were soon too far away to be seen in great detail, so my brother and I drove away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 23 year old, home on vacation from working for a cruiseline in the Caribbean.

We we&#39;re driving down the street, a moderatley busy one in fact, and we stopped at the red light. When we stopped, my mom had seen a set of bright lights WAY further (A LOT FURTHER) near the other end of the street, but she didnt say anything about it. THEN, like 5 seconds later, she noticed that the same lights were RIGHT ACROSS the street from us and my mom had se said &#34;Hey whats that up there?&#34; and i said &#34;Where?&#34;. She pointed over above these houses across the street, and there was a triangular shaped U.F.O hovering over a house! It had multi-colored lights around the bottom edges, and it was HUGE. We knew it wasnt a plane because of its shape, and we werent anywhere near the airport. Plus, it wasnt even moving at all, it was just sitting there. The light turned green, so we drove up about another 80 feet, and pulled to the side of the road. It was right across the street from us...such an awesome sight! Then we realised, there was a small bright light, aproaching from behind the triangle, and it went inside it!! So im guessing that the triangle shaped thing was the mothership...and the bright light was a smaller ufo. I wanted to get out of the car but my mom locked the door and started speeding away. She finally got the courage to drive back when we reached the end of the street, but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night, we had told my aunt about it, and she also has something weird to tell us. At about the same time when she was in her house, she had looked at the time, and it was correct. Then when she looked back about 20 mins later, the time had been set back about 3 hours! But the clock works perfectly fine, batteries and all! Weird or what...?<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I travel HWY 84 every day to work and back and am very familiar with our night sky.  We have very few light sources and can see quite well on any given clear night.  A typical night&#39;s lights usually consist of lots of airplanes, cell and other various towers and scattered utility lights.  We also have some helicopter traffic from Ft. Knox.  They do maneuvers in the valley where my house is located.  They hover and will seemingly shoot straight up into the air.  The sound is sometimes ear shattering if they fly too low.  On the night of Feb. 15 I was returning from Louisville.  The night sky was relatively clear, but very black as it can get down this way.  I noticed a large bright light just over the canopy of the trees.  At first I thought it was a very bright star, again not unusual down this way.  The light became larger the closer I drove.  It was not distant like a star or the moon.  I came to the point of emission just past Union Band Church.  The light was bright white, a lozenge shape, and fixed, seemingly about a 1/4 mile in the air.  There was no noise, the wind was blowing, I felt my large vehile move.  The light had various spots of yellow and red on the outside edge.  I continued travelling and the light receeded out of my vision and became obstructed by the canopy of trees as I descended into the valley.  This may very well be a helicopter, of some sort.  I have never experienced one able to maneuver quite like this.  When a helicopter flies at night with a light that bright the viewer usually sees a beam the light creates.  This light was not a beam.  It seemed to have movement within the light.  Not pulses but movement like the way light moves within a static globe.  I just wanted to record this event before I lost part of the memory of its appearance in my mind.  Time does strange things to the way things look.  By the way,  I have searched the daytime area where this occured.  There are no cell towers on any of the ridges nearby.  I simply saw something I cannot rationally explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Then all lights disappeared and two more showed up at the same time slightly lower on the horizon.  The colour of the light was like an orange street light colour.

I looked up and thought I was witnessing a very low plane headed right for the end store and the parking lot but there was no noise and I did not feel any panic or fear.  There were three lights almost in a row but slightly diagonal from left to right (raised higher on the right).  Two of the lights were closer together on the left and the one on the right was at the tip of the diagonal.  They were amber and white and very bright.  All three moved rapidly above the end store and then hovered there for a few seconds.  I was shocked when they suddenly went completely vertical but I could not keep from staring.  Then they rapidly split off in three directons and became pinpoints of light in a matter of seconds. They just disappeared!  I am an accountant and computer tech, female, married, and I am flipped out by this.  I live close to Indiantown Gap so I thought maybe the guys were on maneuvers but if we have anything that can move that fast, I would be happy to hear about it--this is too weird for me and I would like a logical explanation of what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I said &#34;Take your finger off the hole so I can see you&#34; Then the light was there and I saw an image of a body. It was gray &amp; blurry, somewhat small like about a 10 year old normal size person. No features no hair, just a gray figure of a body. I shouted &#34;tell me who you are,&#34; and no answer. I was sooooo freaked I called maintenance,&amp; my husband along w/friends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing ever like this has ever happened so clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just want to report that I can see clearly thru my peep hole, this time......I truely belive it was an alien. There are some other factors. The light in the hallway was messed up w/timer. Why was it black when looked thru it then said to take finger off &amp; w/in a second it was on &amp; the image appeared? Why did I not hear a knock at the door, just my dog frantically there? I know you may get lots of email. I have to get this off my chest.

2/15/05 15:00|Seattle|WA|Other|5 minutes|Middle February, 2002, 3:00 pm, sunny day, black object east of Seattle, moving erratically within a limited area.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43166.html|144|ndxe200502| Middle February, 2002, 3:00 pm, sunny day, black object east of Seattle, moving erratically within a limited area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was studying for the bar exam on the 4th floor of the law library at Seattle University School of Law. It was a sunny day at about 3:00 in the middle February.  Looking east through large picture windows, I saw what I at first thought was a helicopter at a distance of about 5 miles. What intrigued me was that for an object that I thought was the size of a common traffic helicopter, it was moving incredibly fast. After comprehending that a common helicopter could not move to quickly, I began to think it was something else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it for about 5 minutes or more. It seemed to move forwards and backwards and up and down rather erratically, not with the motion that one would expect from a helicopter, certainly not that of an airplane. It appeared to be hovering in that it had no specific direction. Assuming that it was about 5 miles away, which would have put it over southern Bellevue, I estimate that its movements were limited to about 200 yards, but without any pattern to the movement. It moved sort of like an insect would.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be black, with no discerbable shape. As mentioned, I observed it for about 5 minutes, perhpas more, then turned away. When I looked back, it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
2/15/05 14:45|Parkersburg|WV|Cigar|5 minutes|Cigar shaped silver shining object seen in clear daytime sky.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42438.html|145|ndxe200502| Cigar shaped silver shining object seen in clear daytime sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a warm day for February, around 55 degrees. My nephew was on my roof cleaning out the gutters, that is the only reason I was looking up, I was watching him on the roof (he is 21).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw it first, really moving FAST, coming from the south-east and heading north-west. It was huge, it appeared to be silver, and very bright, as if light was being shined on it, it had no lights, nothing flashing, no sound, and no tail or jetstream. It was huge and we could see it very well, as the sky was clear. It had no front or rear, and no windows, it&#39;s entire shape was the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I saw it, I asked my nephew what it was, he looked and we both watched it. As it started to get out of our vision, a jet was coming toward us from the north (it had a fuel trail as a jet does), these two objects were going to cross paths and were nearly side by side at one point. The jet was high in the sky and tiny (although you could tell that it had wings), and this thing was four or five times longer than the jet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am stunned to say the least, we really have no clue what it is we saw.<n>
2/15/05 12:40|Stanwood|WA|Disk|7 minutes or so|black and silver disk - seen again?|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43020.html|146|ndxe200502| black and silver disk - seen again?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking over old UFO reports for my area, and read with GREAT interest this report, identified as: Occurred : 8/7/2002 13:35 (Entered as : 08/07/02 1335) Reported: 8/7/2002 8:16:51 PM 20:16 Posted: 2/11/2003 Location: Arlington, WA Shape: Other<n> <n><n> <n><n> In this report from 2002 the witness described a shape that first appeared as a stationary dark line, which, when it moved, moved in a wobbly fashion, appeared dark on edge but silvery on top, and was a bit thicker in its middle than the edge, and when it tilted, was thought to be elliptical.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just a month ago (mid-February 2005), my mother and I saw what could be this thing’s twin in looks and movement.  When we saw it there was a little breeze out, so we tried to think of earthly explanations for what we saw--pool or hot tub cover, construction debris, tarp, a super-jumbo sized remote-controlled helium toy, but nothing quite worked because the wind wasn’t that strong, the thing was at least as big as my van, and the thing seemed to be moving slowly and intelligently, and often against the breeze -- not just getting tossed around by it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we first spotted it, I had just picked up my mother from her apartment near the east edge of Stanwood.  Sitting in the parking lot, we saw it coming up from behind some big fir trees that were some blocks further east from us (there are fields and woods out that way).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing banked, showing us a big dark disk that I thought was at least as wide as my Chevy Venture van was long.  The disk then spiraled up higher and leveled out above the fir trees.  We could now see that while the disk was dark on the bottom, it was a metallic silver on top, and when viewed on edge the disk was thicker in the middle - slightly more pronounced near the center of the silver side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It banked again, so we moved the car to a different spot where we could watch it, overlooking the east edge of the high school football field.  The disk continued to wobble and rotate along the edge of town, bank and spiral, level out, hover, taking its time working its way along the east edge of the Church Creek housing development and city park as it headed toward Highway 532.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer to the highway and the grocery store/strip mall there, it went waaaaay high until we could barely see it as a bright silver point against a big cloud bank.  Lost sight of it then.  The whole sighting lasted around 7 minutes.   I&#39;d still be tempted to think we saw some sort of wind-driven large piece of trash except it didn&#39;t behave like it was affected by the breeze.  It seemed to be on some sort of sightseeing trip!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
2/15/05 09:30|Riverside|CA|Other|5 minutes|Orange V shaped object observed overhead|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73841.html|147|ndxe200502| Orange V shaped object observed overhead<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 02/15/2005 I had just returned home after taking my son to school, about 0930. I looked up at the sky as I walked from my car to the house to look at the clouds.  Almost directly overhead, in a clear patch between the clouds, I saw a brilliant, glowing orange V-shaped object.  It appeared stationary when I first saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into the house to get a small spotting scope that I use for bird watching and returned. Using the scope, I saw that the V object was not solid orange, but had alternating sections of orange and white.  It had some type of structure to it that I could not quite make out due to distance.  The best I and describe it is a length of a crane or bridge, with it’s intricate crosspieces, bent at a 45 degree angle, painted orange and white. I was not a wing shape at all, as the arms of the V did not have much width to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object would drift in and out of the clouds as they passed by to the NE, the clouds sometimes partially obscuring the object. I would estimate the size as similar to the wingspan of a commercial jet aircraft.  The object seemed to maneuver periodically to remain near the edge of the clouds.  I watched until the cloud cover thickened and the object was not visible any longer, about 5 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize this is almost 5 years ago and I am just reporting it now.  At the time, I assumed that, due to the color, it was some sort of experimental device.  I also considered the date (day after Valentine’s day) of the sighting, that it may have been a balloon arch that got loose, but I have since had the chance to observe balloons released into the sky and they did not behave or look they way this object did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting it now since I see so many reports of V and triangle shaped objects, maybe this is some piece of the puzzle.<n>

There was no drinking at this party(we were playing Halo 2) It was around midnight and it was a clear night with few stars in the sky.  I looked up to take in the calm night when I saw a flashing object.  I thought that it was just another one of those things but I looked at it again and saw it moving very fast across the sky.  I wasn&#39;t scared because I thought that it was too far away.  It blended right in with the sky.  It turned at rather odd and amazing angles.  Then more of these flashing objects moved in.  They looked exactly the same and then I started thinking that this was out of this world.  They started doing manouevers that looked well planned possibly they were all from the same mothership.  Then they left as quickly as they had come towards the moon.  Now that I look back on it I think that this was part of a U.S. military spy training in Canada since we are not that far from the border.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain whether the sighting occurred on the morning of, or evening of, February 15.

2/14/05 19:00|Rockport|TX|Light|1 hour|several unexplained, fast  moving lights in the Rockport, Texas sky disappear after black laser beam is shot into sky|2/22/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41955.html|152|ndxe200502| several unexplained, fast  moving lights in the Rockport, Texas sky disappear after black laser beam is shot into sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from the grocery store with my sister and sister-in-law. My sister said &#34;look at that light in the sky, it&#39;s white, blue, and red.&#34; I was driving so I could not pay very much attention, but I glanced up and noticed it. My sister then said &#34;look, it&#39;s moving.&#34; At that point my sister-in-law in the back seat said &#34;that is not a helicopter, it&#39;s moving too fast.&#34; I wanted to check it out because they seemed to be alarmed about it. As I was turning the corner I looked up in the sky and I saw it move very fast back in the directon that it was coming from, so I immediately pulled over into a driveway and parked. We continued to watch for about 3 minutes when we noticed that there were more lights blinking and moving in the sky. They began to move back and forth and up and down way too fast to be anything other than ufo&#39;s. We noticed that they seemed to be responding to each other by blinking their lights in patterns and after they would do this we noticed the others moving towards each other. At this point we were outside the car screaming to each other in disbelief of what we were seeing. Then we noticed that one of them began to come closer in our atmosphere and moving in our direction. At that point I called my husband, hysterically trying to explain what we were seeing. In this time that I was on the phone the object came closer and moved over our heads at about as high as a helicopter would fly, and that is when we knew these objects were not stars or planes, etc. We could actually see the lights rotating in a clockwise motion around   the middle of the circular craft. That object continued past us, and headed towards town.I then hung up with my husband who thought I must have gone insane. We then focused on the 6-7 other lights in the sky that were moving quickly and flashing lights that were a reddish color. The lights were then scattered throughout the sky and we saw some that they were moving in the direction of our apartments so we hurried home. As I was coming in the apartment complex we noticed that one of the lights looked like it was coming down toward the ground so we drove to the back of apartments to continue watching it. It then started moving behind the trees so we could not see it. Then all of a sudden it came back up into the sky above the trees and then we noticed the other lights coming over from up the street. By this time we are terrifird because there are so many at one time we were afraid that we were being invaded at that moment, so we called the local sheriff&#39;s office and began reporting what we saw, and asked if there were other report&#39;s yet. As my siser was talking to the person on the phone I noticed a bigger light coming from the ground up over the trees. The best way to describe it would be the way a light turns on a lighthouse, except we don&#39;t actually see the light, just the flashing rotation. Just as that light was turning I saw a beam of black light shoot up into the sky where the objects were. I would have expected a laser light to be white but this was not, it looked like a shadow of a laser being shot in the sky. At that point I was really thinking I was insane , and I said to the girls &#34;did you see that black laser beam shoot into the sky&#34;, just as I said that another black beam extended to the sky and we all saw it that time. It was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever seen, as it happened we were all screaming into the phone to the sheriff&#39;s office what had just happened with the beam and that was enough to get him off the phone and out to where this was happening. He informed us that he was leaving the station to see what we were reporting. We did not tell him our exact location or names in fear of us being labeled as insane. We then noticed that after that beam of dark light the colored flashing lights seemed to just flicker out into space as if they were never there. We then rushed home to tell my brother and he confided in us that he&#39;s seen them ever so often in the same vicinity where we saw them. I did call the sheriff&#39;s office back to see what the officer had witnessed and we were told that the sargeant was the one who left and he had&#39;nt returned yet. I know this sounds crazy but I am a 25 yr. old mother who works in the medical field and the last time I checked I was completely sane. After seeing that black laser beam of light shoot into the sky I know that what we witnessed was not ordinary. I have always been interested in ufo&#39;s even as a child but I had never seen one. I forgot to mention that after seeing the first light I said to my sister &#34;I always look and wish to see one&#34; and that is when they just seemed to come from everywhere. It was like they were saying &#34;you wanted to see us here we are, take a good look.&#34;  This experience has changed my life, I came home and described it to my husband and began to cry because everything changes when you actually see one up close and personal. When I&#39;m reading or watching tv shows about them I can put it off as someone&#39;s imagination. Now it is clear to me that we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to have the other witnesses to the alleged event submit their independent reports, as well.

The subway and the Amtrak share a stretch of rail through this part of Boston that heads to NYC and I often see helicopters flying along this path and figured it was just a TV traffic copter or some other helicopter flying towards us. I noticed it was particularly low (maybe the height of a ten story building) and I couldn&#39;t hear it like I typically do when a helicopter passes over. As it flew past us on our left (driver&#39;s side) we could see that the copter had no discernible markings on it and was a dull, slate grey/black color and had a enclosed rotor in the tail - very modern looking. It slowed to a hover and looked as though it was looking for something or someone (if I had to guess on the way it was traveling - most of the other&#39;s just zoom along towards Logan or the hospitals). Even very near to us it was quiet. The whole thing struck me as odd and figured I would report it since &#34;black helicopters&#34; seem to be common around a UFO incident. About five minutes later another copter passed along a similar flight path and was much higher up and garnered no additional attention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  It is unusual for a helicopter to be as quiet as what the witness describes.  However, there are some helicopters, used for military or intelligence purposes, which have &#34;hush kits&#34; installed, which make them much quieter than a typical helicopter.  PD))<n>

The object was a dull white in color. As the object fell, it disappeared behind a cloud, and did not reappear below the cloud, as it should have done, if it was in a free fall.  The object was not an aircraft, but something round and under intelligent control. I&#39;ve held a commercial pilot&#39;s license for 36 years, &amp; I say it was not of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another encounter of mine: In August 4-6, 1991, I was standing in the snow at the 7000&#39; level of Mt Hood. I saw a round shinny object moving slowly at 090 degrees, at 12,500&#39;, then the object came to a stop directly over Mt Hood. The oject glowed, then moved 8 miles south (160 degrees)&amp; stopped, then moved 16 miles north (360 degrees)and stopped, then it moved directly back over Mt. Hood again, then sped out of sight (2 seconds) heading 090 degrees again. All this took place in a matter of seconds. I reported this to the park ranger, who said she gets UFO reports daily!?! So she was not concerned. The object was identical to the objects that was seen flying or hovering over Mexico City in 1990 or 91.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be exceptionally credible.

My husband, brother and I had only been there about a day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I had been standing on the beach looking at the stars.  I had walked back up to the truck to do something, leaving my husband by the water about 15 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately after opening the truck door and sitting down, something caught my eye in the sky.  Immediately I could not rationalize what it was.  I immediately stood up, took of running down the beach screaming my husbands name and to look in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband looked in the air and watched in amazement at what he saw.  The object was pretty low and seemed like it floated through the air, not in a straight line.  It was either one triangular shaped craft with 3 circular lights on the bottom of it, or 3 circular crafts flying in a triangular formation. Also, I heard no noise when it was overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother was by the campfire about 20 feet away,  my husband ran towards the camp yelling for him.  By the time My brother made it to the beach it had moved across the horizon and dissapeared.  And when I say dissapeared it was moving and then it was just gone.  I have drawn a very rough picture on my paint program on my computer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot explain what I saw and neither can my husband.  We stood there on that beach and watched the sky for the next couple of hours and seen nothing else in the sky that night.<n>

At the same time my dogs were barking loudly apparently for no reason.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked towards the Orion belt, I got almost startled seeing a slow-moving reddish-golden blinking light or two.  Immediately the blinking light(s) increased in number to around six or seven and pulsed away on and off at a rapid rate from left to right in a straight string-like pattern apparently under the belly of the possible flying craft (which could not be seen due to dark evening though the sky was fully clear of any clouds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The possible craft started heading at quite a fast rate (faster than any normal aircraft) towards north-west direction (opposite to the airport) while the lights continued to blink in changing colors of red, golden, green and blue.  Within a minute or so the possible craft silently moved away out of my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Living close to the international airport of our capital since last twenty years I have had a good guess and estimation on structural designs of commercial airlines, two-engine light planes and choppers, etc. in flight. But the above described craft with those string-like blinking lights that I witnessed was completely different from any earthly aircraft.<n>

It had white and green lights and circular in shape.  There were 2 other airplanes that flew by.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Tempreture was around 85 degrees. Two of my friends and I were playing golf. We were driving our carts towards the green when I just so happened to take a glance at the sky and saw this circular craft that was chrome looking and very, very shiny and moving slowly into the clouds. At the same time my friend was asking me a question. I took my eyes off the craft for a second to look at my friend and answer his question. I thought to myself I&#39;ll catch it again once it comes out the other side of the cloud. It never did. I quickly told my friends about what I saw and asked them to help me spot it in the sky. It never showed up again. If it was a plane or balloon it should&#39;ve pass through the clouds and reveiled itself on the other side of the clouds. NOTHING! At the same time when I saw it I had a strange feeling inside, I can&#39;t describe it. It was definitely strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/13/05 03:00|Oshawa (Canada)|ON|Disk|20 minutes|Large disk-shaped object with three lights sighted on rural highways outside Oshawa/Pickering, Ontario.|2/22/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42019.html|164|ndxe200502| Large disk-shaped object with three lights sighted on rural highways outside Oshawa/Pickering, Ontario.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend ((male name deleted)) and I were going East on Highway 7. ((name deleted)) was driving. The object was gliding quickly West just below the clouds when I noticed it, and I could see only its lights, but not yet its shape. After a few minutes, it went into the clouds and lit up the mist enough to see the droplets in the air, and its disk shape was at least three times the size of a commercial aircraft. It hovered for a good solid 10 minutes. It faded into a tiny point, then returned to it&#39;s original size!  It changed position from being horizontal to vertical to the ground, but mostly remained vertical. It had three lights. The bottom light was a very bright, brilliant white, and very large. It was flashing extremely fast, and somewhat erratically. It appeared to be made of overlapping light rays. It had an almost a solid dome shape, but looked like a flower, or a thousand-petalled lotus like the traditional image of the crown chakra. The middle light was a dimmer, flat, solid circle, slightly off-center to the left of the bottom light. It was closer to the bottom light than the top, and was not flashing. The top light was a dark red colour, also a flat solid circle, and was flashing slowly and steadily. The top light was lined up with the bottom one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I both experienced strong tingling sensations around our chest and crown. I got rushes throughout my body.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object began to move again. It then faded out of view for a few minutes, flashed the red light once more, and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An hour or so later, when we were returning to Toronto, travelling West on Regional Road 22, the object reappeared. It was very low in the sky and drifting slowly down over Lake Ontario, in a vertical position to the ground. The intersection we were at was stuck on stop in all directions, except for one pedestrian light on the left side in front of us, that was stuck on go, for about five minutes. The radio faded out for as long as the intersection lights were stuck. Again, my friend and I felt tingling at our crown and chest, once again I got rushes, and the air generally felt alive. Things of ours that were with us got really staticky after that, and stayed that way for about two days. When the object was out of sight, seeming to have either gone over the lake into the US, or [and this is what it really seemed like] into the lake! There was no sound from the object at all. And, just my luck, the camera in my bag had just run out of film! [We were out there to take photographs of the city from afar, after visiting with ((witness&#39;s)) folks].<n>

I am not a velosity expert by far, but I would have calcalated by the distance covered in the approximate two (2) seconds of visual exposure that the object was traveling between 15,000 and 24,000 MPH. This was not a meteor, due to the fact that anyone    who(m) has studied meteors, knows that meteors have tails and that depending on their composition what colours are present. i.e.; stone meteors are white and have white tails, copper shows as green, oxygen-red...etc. This area of the country is virtually free of flight paths, so when something does fly by on a clear night be it commercial, military, or other, it tends to stand out. Also, I am originally from Chicago and have lived in many metropolitan centres on this planet ,as well as spent 13 years on Navy and Marine Bases and Air Stations. I know manmade aircraft when I, either see it, or hear it. This object was silent. Was anyone else fortunate enough to witness this object other than me?<n>

It was a flourescent green object similar to a glow-stick. The light appeared and traveled at a very high rate of speed about 30 feet over my head. It probably went 40 to 50 feet from my right to left. The light then just vanished. I have no idea what it was. It was too close to ground to be a meteor crossing the sky. It seemed as if it were just above the tree tops. I could clearly see the outline of the object to be a small cigar shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The 805 runs nearest just under the flight path while the 5 runs near the coast and its 5 or 10 miles to the west of the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of 2/12/05 the 805 freeway was closed for several miles north and south of the base. From the 805 you can see the base, from the 5 you can not see the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All traffic was diverted to the 5 on Sat. and Sunday nights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea if there is a connection but my thoughts are that if they were testing something there and didn&#39;t want people from the freeway to see it then they would close it off and divert traffic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did this on several weekends.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was odd about this is that there is a short section of the 805 that is being repaired near the Mira Mesa exit. There was no reason to have the detour go as far as south as it did. The next connecting freeway was 7 or 8 miles south of the 5 and 805 split. So both the north and south bound sections of the 805 were blocked off for 10 miles, 3 miles north of the base and 7 miles south of the base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made me think, why?  Now I read what that guy wrote and wonder, maybe?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If anyone can provide more information about this alleged traffic diversion, we would welcome an explanation of what happened there.  We have no reason, at this time, to assume that the traffic diversion had anything to do with UFO&#39;s.  PD))<n>

We just so happen to start talking about aliens and abductions, when out of the dark winter sky we seen an unclear shaped light that kept changing colours comming from the north-west heading towards us. At first we thought it was a UFO, but people joke around about that all the time. The craft was going much faster then a normal airplane. about at least 3 or 4 times faster. We got scared as the object at flight was moving farther away, yet looking as if it was to land. At the west another object at flight seemed to follow the craft, we believe it to have been an airplane. Just a bit after the airplane and object at flight had dissappeared, another, from the same spot as the other appeared it appeared. It looked exactly the same as the first object at flight, it may just have been the same one that just turned around. In the same amount as the other one took it dissappeared, in the same spot. The objects that are believede to be UFOs were just about 100 feet above the ground, or less.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As we were approaching the intersection, I notice 4 very bright lights - in a pair above the treeline in the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t know what they were and my boyfriend thought they must be tower lights of somekind.  I was not aware of any toweres being built there, but thought it might be a reasonable conclusion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As time went on, I thought they were moving to the east and toward us and the town.  At that point, we thought they might be military planes as there is a strip in the area somewhere.  But, I felt these craft were too big to be military planes.  However, it was dark and so one couldn&#39;t see much but the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we passed through the interestion, I continued to watch and noticed the lights on the craft.  I felt they were not the usual lighting of commercial planes.  I am not that familiar with military planes, but the back lights did not seem to reflect that of tail lights - but a circular set of green lights (maybe 5).  There was at least one red blinking light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We turned around to get a better look while the crafts were flying over the Hwy.  We thought we would be able to get a good look because they seemed to move slowly.  But, as we turned around, we were not able to see much else at a close range.  They were at a low altitude like military planes, but we did not hear any loud engine sounds like I have heard in the past.  I guess I didn&#39;t think that much about it because we were in a car and may not have been able to hear a noise like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think the biggest thing that stands out is that the &#34;wing span&#34; of the bright 2 lights (left and right) seemed way too wide for a plane and most of all, I have not seen green lights like that before on a plane.  I have seen lots of military planes in the area and this did not seem to be like what I had seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((COMMENT FROM READER))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 2/12/2005 18:00 (Entered as : 02/12/2005 18:00) Reported: 2/13/2005 9:40:50 PM 21:40 Posted: 2/22/2005 Location: Jordan, MN Shape: Sphere Duration:15 minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> This witness might have seen C-130 Hercules planes flying in formation into the MInneapolis airport.

At about mile marker 25 I noticed a tall rectangle in the overcast sky. The sky was typical gray-blue, as commonly seen here in the winter. I think this is why I noticed this shape, it was just up there in the sky to my right. It was white in color, rectangle in shape with a glow around it. Traffic was light to moderate at the time so I was able to look around in the sky and to my left, about North, I saw two contrails. So now I am watching this shape to my right and the contrails which are closing in on the shape on my left. I kept comparing the two situations and the two contrails were headed right for the shape. As the contrails got close to the shape they seem to split into seperate directions around the shape. The shape never seemed to move, change in appearance, it just floated there. At this point I went past the point to see any more activity. I have been around aircraft all my life. My father was in the Air National Guard and my uncle was a high ranking officer in the Air Force. I also have worked for Boeing in WA. In the report I refer to contrails moving to intercept the shape because I never saw what these aircraft were.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was still in my hometown of Penge in London at around 8:30 give or take a few minutes. I was in the front seat and looked up out of the windscreen to see a hovering cigar shaped object just above the clouds. When I looked a bit closer it appeared to be glowing a white light of some sort.  It seemed to be just hovering as opposed to moving but I didn&#39;t see it for very long because the clouds covered it up, I must have seen it for about 4-7 seconds. I am a schoolboy of 9 years old and although I was not scared or shocked by the sighting I am very interested to found out what this could have been and if there were any other sightings in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I had just pulled in the long driveway that leads both to my boss&#39;s house and to her dog kennel where I worked when I spotted something very bright in the sky to my left.  I watched it as I drove slowly down the driveway and soon I realized it was coming my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled into the parking lot and hurriedly opened the door just as the thing came over above me, flying low to the ground and at a slow pace.  It&#39;s so fuzzy to me now to try and recall, but I remember walking towards the building where I work, thinking, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s just an airplane,&#34; but knowng that it couldn&#39;t be, especially since I heard no noise, like the engine an airplane would make.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was large and circular, from what I recall.  Lights were very bright and large underneath it and illuminated parts of the ship.  I&#39;m not sure why, but I watched it as I opened the door to the building and stepped inside, dismissing it, almost as if I was forced to think nothing of it.  In fact, once I stepped inside, I nearly forgot about the whole thing completely.  It wasn&#39;t until much later that I even remembered anything at all.  This seems odd to me since something of that magnitude wouldn&#39;t normally be something someone would forget so easily.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft, whatever it was, was gone within minutes since I had stepped outside once again to unlock the gates and it was no longer in site.  I wish I could remember more, and the memories I do have are clouded for some reason, but it&#39;s all I&#39;ve got.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I was driving my car and it was slightly off to the west of 83. The object moved from south to north in the same direction I was traveling. We sighted the light as we approached middle country road the lightlooked as though it was at an extremely low altitude it scame out of no where i thought it was a plane flying low and about to crash. I was truely frightened upon the site of it. It appeared to travel directly over the Suffolk County 6th precinct police department, and into the parking lot across middle country road in between Ruby Tuesdays and Wendys. We were so astonished by what we saw we decided to turn around about a quarter mile up 83 to inspect the parking lot where we thought this greenish-blue light had decended into. We found nothing out of the ordinary. This object traveled south to north at what appeared to be decending at a very low altitude. I would say around 100-200 ft in the sky and about 3-5 ft diameter. This only happened a short while ago and I still have goosebumps..The light actually vanished before it came near the ground but it seemed as though it would crash. I found no evidence of any impact in the parking lot where we thought it might have landed. We went back over the same route we traveled when we saw it to make sure what we saw was no glare or anything from a traffic light or something...even though we both saw the light decending clear as anything. We detterminded that we saw the light aproximatly 20 feet before the left turning lane for middle country road on route 83. The skies are unusaully clear. no clouds at all. When i arived at my house about 2miles from the sighting, i was freaked out and looking into the clear sky at all the stars hoping to see or not see another light of the same sort. I am a little freaked out still.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They stopped at at T-intersection stop sign. No other cars were on the rural road nor people on the street at the time. My girlfriend was the passenger, so was able to get a better observation. She is a quite sane, college-educated professional person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they stopped at the T-intersection (to take a right turn on the two lane road) she saw a perfectly circular white light (which she said looked just like a full moon) come from the right, traveling along the road at a height of just three or four feet (eye level with the hood of the small car). There was a church directly in front of the stop sign on the other side of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object came directly in front of the car, traveling horizontally, no more than 100ft in front, then went straight up and over the church, where they lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She estimated the object was only about six feet in diameter. She said it was the size of dinner plate held at arms length. It made no sound. There were no flashing lights or changes in color from the original yellow-white. She also described it as one of the glow-in-the-dark frisbees turned on its side. It travelled fast, but not at blinding speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She said it move purposely. It did not stop in front of their car but kept moving. She did not know if it went up into the sky or just hopped over the church to the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The driver made her right turn on to the cross road, the direction the object had come from. She said it travelled along the road from the right to the left, in front of the car, before going straight up over the church.  They thought about going back to see if they could see it again but decided not to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The car was traveling south from Milford into Bellingham, then took the right, going west on to the cross road. They were heading back to Lincoln, Rhode Island. There were no electrical problems with their car or missing time or any other anomalies, she said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Addendum to Bellingham, MA, of 02/12/05.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is an addendum to the sighting on this date: Later in the day after my girlfriend had called that morning to tell me of what they saw, I decided to call two police departments, Bellingham, and nearby Blackstone. Both dispachers told me that no one else had called about a UFO (I doubt they would have told me otherwise, anyway).<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, next, I called News Channel 10, WJAR, Providence. I spoke to news person, a young man, about what my girlfriend saw. He said, oh yeah, we had a few other reports from last night in that same area at about the same time. He went on to say that the previous night the same small circle of light had been seen in another town in Massachusetts, named Billerica.  When nothing appeared on the news on Channel 10 that night I called back the next day to WJAR and asked why nothing was reported. A young woman said she didn&#39;t know, but maybe the editor, &#34;Tim&#34; could tell me. She went to look for Tim but said he was not available and I&#39;d have to call back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had the feeling he didn&#39;t want to discuss it or the reasons it was not &#34;newsworthy.&#34;  Also, my girlfriend, upon further reflection of that night, said the object could well have been smaller than the six feet in diameter she originally thought it might be, but in no way any larger.  So, other witnesses called in to the news station of that same sighting and one for the previous night, but of course, nothing on the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((END ADDENDUM))<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the source of the report, and congratulate him for his willingness to follow up on a report.

It was 200 to 300ft above the pinetrees heading south at speed of a single engine craft.  The object was lighted at about a 75watt lightbulb.  The object made no sound.  I followed the object as far as could and just before it went out of site it appeared to be two off set spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

What I figured was landing lights looked strange, the light where a dull white in color where pointing down or out not forward and they where in a perfect triangle shape and there was no other marker or formation lights on this object. This sighting only lasted about 5 seconds and then it went back into the clouds. I been thinking about this all day and I figure this was no conventional aircraft because when normal aircraft are on approach to land in the rain you can usually make out the beams of landing light pointing forward in the rain, this object lights didn&#39;t do that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a background in aviation and have spend 20 years in the military working on F-15 and F-16 aircraft I&#39;ve watch many night time landings in the rain and this was completely different.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 5 years ago I saw a shooting star at Nolin Lake, so at first so that I wouldn&#39;t freak out I told myself it must have been a shooting star, but it didn&#39;t look the same as the first one I saw. I am a person who has to see to believe and the night I saw the unknown flash, I began to think it could&#39;ve been something I need to look into.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason I kinda feel scared about telling anyone, not scared that they would not believe me but scared of what I saw could possibly harm me.<n>

Our house over looks the river and the West end of the Portland International Airport. When I looked up I saw a very bright light that was white and blue with red lights that flashed and moved around the object. I went back into the house and determined that it was at about 190 degrees on the compass dial from magnetic North. I turned on the television and watched tv for about 40 minutes, when I checked on the object again, it had moved approximately 2 degrees to the West. I went back to the tv and checked again 30 minutes later and it had moved approximately 15 degrees to the West. I fell asleep and when I awoke at 03:00, it was gone. When I was observing it, I never really saw it move, it seemed to hang in the sky with small gyrating motions. I know it was not an incoming airplane or helo because it was way above the normal flight patterns that come into PDX at that time of the night and it hung around too long. I always check the sky every night for anomalies during the last 1.5 weeks I have been here and this is the first time I have seen this object, as I report this on 2/11/04, it is not in the sky tonight (I checked before the clouds rolled in).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect.

2/10/05 23:10|Baltimore|MD|Other|Unknown|Three Cruise ship-shaped objects viewed on descent to BWI airport, Baltimore Maryland|2/22/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41914.html|192|ndxe200502| Three Cruise ship-shaped objects viewed on descent to BWI airport, Baltimore Maryland<n> <n><n> <n><n> While approaching BWI airport on flight 1515 Southwest Airlines I observed three objects, approximately 10 degrees above the skyline.  Two were parallel to each other, and the third was just a little below the two.  They were shaped similarly to vacation cruise ships, albeit much longer and more slender,  and   because of the perspective, must have in actuality been a lot larger, certainly much larger than the plane I was in.  Many other passengers were looking out the window, presumably at the objects, because on most flights I take, I don&#39;t see many people watching out the window during the landing.  No one commented on the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I thought I must have been seeing some weird reflection,  or some lit up building that was resting on a low mountain or hill but they really were too solid and distinct to have been some oddity of the light, and the Baltimore/D.C. area doesn&#39;t have mountains to say the least.  They were subtlely lit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind totally tried to rationalize what I saw, because they weren&#39;t like any common aircraft at all.  When I first glanced at them I thought they were other planes coming in to land, but I soon realized that they were too long and far too large, only their distance made them seem momentarily comparable in size to our aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Only upon seeing an image of a reported UFO seen around 3am over Washington, D.C. on the Coast to Coast am site did I decide to make this report.  The objects I saw were very similar to that image, although I saw three of them and from further away.  So they looked more like huge, long cruise ships, and less like the lighted cigar-shaped object pictured on the main page of the website. www.coasttocoastam.com<n>

I saw what I thought was a shooting star but it was more a ball of light with a long tail trailing behind it that never faded just dissapeared behind the trees I though oh cool I just saw a comet.   Then to the west of me I saw what was first shaped like a fat cigar object with two white lights a red light and I think a blue or green. shapped light a fat cigar with round lights. I watched as it was over head of me it went from4-6 lights to just two white circular lights as it went over me.I saw the siloette  reflection from the stars what appears the  shape of a fat cigar with two triangle prongs on top of the craft. It had a mild engine  very quite noise but nothing like a plane.. I wasn&#39;t sure if it was a government plane but it seemed more like a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I went and got bi-noculars and it was a circular bright light with a lot of bluish lights all over I would guess it was the bottom.  It moved around alot as I proped my arms up against the glass for steadyness.  It must have been going higher also as it would get small all of the sudden, and then you would see the large circle with lights again ..I must have watched it for 30 min.  and called friend who lives 6 blocks from me...he had to go outside...to look in the direction I was asking him to look which from my home in Woodland would be looking towards Davis.  There is a lot of farm country between the 2 towns.  Also in the same direction would have been Travis AFB...but I could not find a contact on their website.  I gave up when my friend couldnt see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  PD))<n>

Its brightness was about like a car headlight from a half-block away. It appeared to go down between here and the Reno airport. The airport is about three miles west; there is farmland &amp; wetlands between here and there. I went outside and whatever was there was now gone. Lots of dogs barking. Nothing on the local news, so I figured I&#39;d post a report and see if anybody else saw it.

They were moving pretty fast but not abnormally fast and in sync with one another.  The best way i could describe it is they were moving like butteflies move.  Almost &#34;dancing-like&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were flying upward in a northeast direction.  Twice they moved towards each other almost touching and then right back away from each other.  All the while they kept flying in the northeast direction.  Finally they went behind a building so they were out of my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would guess that if I lived in the building they went behind (approx 20 blocks away) I would have seen them extremely close.  I couldnt believe what I saw and was speechless.  I&#39;ve been looking out these windows for two years and know what stars, helicopters, planes, fireworks, etc etc etc all look like and this was nothing I have ever seen before.<n>

Declination from the horizon was about 85 degrees.  No contrails or cloud distrubance was seen. The white object was crisply defined and brightly lite against the sky.  The shape was flattened top and bottom with sharply oval ends(cigar shape) and traveled in a straight path.  Its size seemed rather large for a distance object in space (i.e. satellite).  A small plane and a commerial aircraft was seen just prior to the sighting, which is within the inner ring of Class B airspace of Charlotte International.  This sighting was witnessed by my sixteen year old daughter while taking photos for a school project (film out at time of sighting).  She found the experience to be distorting and upsetting and reported the incidence to me the next day.  This report is being sumitted by her father who is an aircraft pilot.  I  believe the object to be a spacecraft, although its precise shape, daytime appearance and apparent closeness is puzzling. This report is part of our discussion and understanding of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The direction was southwest.  It appeared to be 1-3 miles away and was somewhat close to the ground.  Initially I thought it was the top floor of a distant building being worked on by a team of welders.  I didn&#39;t recall a building being there so it sparked my interest that much more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through binoculars it looked cigar shaped.  The middle of it was radiating with  very bright lights (white, blue, red, orange).  It was stationary for a couple of minutes but then started slowly moving north. The object disappeared behind a building that&#39;s about 300 yards from me and I never saw it appear on the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s initial location was about a mile or a little less directly north of E.D.S. (Electronic Data Systems) and as I mentioned before, moved north from there.  It could have been as far away as Dallas Pkwy. between Legacy and Headquarters or just east of there.<n> <n><n> http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?name=&amp;ed=9c.Uk.p_0Tphyk14aQcvuUc39CtpL4nWUdfgggS5S5 pYTahcPrl1EhVFeFMSsXv9oRDJ0bhro_ltFvCpaf4oKvxPq2dSZ6e74EIx6.qe0z6IaA--&amp;csz=Plano%2C+TX+75023&amp;desc=&amp;mag=3&amp;ds=n&amp;state=TX&amp;uzip=75023&amp;country=US&amp;BFKey=&amp;cat=shop&amp;resize=l&amp;trf =0<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object could very well have been a blimp but it seemed too long and narrow.

So i decided to pull over and get a closer look. At first i thought it might be a plane or somthing but it had no flashing light and wa just orange. so we pulled over the two lights were seprate from one another one was in the top right of the sky the other was towards the left. the one on the left slowly was going downwardthe one on the right witch we were mainly focusing on was going left and then shifted and went right it then stoped and either droped or somthing sparked underneath it as if it droped something the same collor as itself.  then it moved towards the right and blinked away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldnt belivre what i just saw i dindt know what to think of it i then focused my attention on the other light witch hade quickly changed its slow moving pace and went toward where the other had just disapeeard. it then reapeated then didnt drop anything but it bliked away. it was crazy . oddley i seen it again both in the same town with more witnesses i had already told the first sighting to. i will post seperatly on the date of 2/14/05 if anyone is interested<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I looked up and saw a small disk glowing very bright green, just the color of a traffic light. It moved quickly across the sky in a westerly or slight southwesterly direction. As it moved away from me it appeared only as a white light. It streaked across the sky very quickly, being visible for only about a second, and then disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was left rather stunned and wondering what it was. I would rule out any commercial or private aircraft. I would estimate its altitude at somewhere less than 10,000 feet. An aircrat at this altitude would move much more slowly. In fact  several minutes later I saw a plane cross the same area, and it was tiny and moving very slowly. The object I saw was also completely silent. The lights it displayed did not resemble those of a typical aircraft. I have observed military aircraft over Boston. They were extremely loud. If this was a stealth bomber why would it display the bright green light?  I would also rule out a low or high orbit satellite as I have seen them before and they look completely different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a graduate of the University of Maine at Orono with a B.S. degree in Biology and also a graduate of the Massachusetts School of Law with a J.D.

They seemed to not go lower than 1/4 up the horizon and not go higher than 3/4 up the horizon. We were unable to judge distance since we were driving and it was dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were very bright white lights, I don’t recall seeing any colored lights, and they were moving slowly westward.  I went to look for my binoculars in another room, when I got back into the living room the lights were traveling in my direction.  I went out to the front porch to get a better look and try to hear the aircraft, they were moving very slowly, not like an airplane or helicopter, I thought maybe a blimp but couldn’t hear any sounds coming from the lights.  The lights passed in front of my neighbor’s house which is north of my position, their house being approximately 300 feet away.  How far the lights were in front of their house I have no idea, but they appeared to be right in front of if from my point of view.  The distance between the lights was the size of two of my fists held at arms length, and black in the center, in other words I couldn’t see anything in between the two lights, which led me to think maybe a blimp but still no sound what so ever.  Maybe it was two aircrafts flying side by side, each with one light on them, whatever it was all I could see was the light, not a shape of a craft or anything to describe how it looked.  I lost them behind the trees on our property, they were traveling west/southwest at the time and I didn’t spot them again on the other side of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbors who live in the house described above were gone at the time and the other neighbors I talked to didn’t see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC N<n>

I was laying on the trampoline in our backyard looking straight up when I noticed the stars being blotted out by something.  Conditions were clear directly above me, no moon, very dark sky. There was a light cloud layer to the north approx. 800 - 1000 feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I focused on the craft and could see it was about 400 feet above me.  Completely dark with a very light grayish V along the botton.  It was going very, very slowly and there was no sound what so ever. There was also no masking noises in the area to block any sound it might have been making.  It was moving south to north very slowly.  It was extremely difficult to see and although it was very close, it was very, very dark.  It had no lights of any kind.  No wingtip markers, no strobes, no anti-collision lights.  There was significant commercial air traffic in the air and it was flying right under the landing path for BWI aircraft as it traveled north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it passed over I got off of the trampoline and walked to the hillside to get a rear view.  When it was between myself and the cloud layer it was almost completely triangular.  I would have thought it was an Stealth Fighter F-117 but the tail was not serated, and it was flying way, way too slowly and with out any marker lights.  I had a good low angle view to its rear and still saw no marker lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I should report it.  A thousand of these could have flown over my house and I would never have seen them.  It was extremely difficult to see.  I have seen stealth aircraft at airshows, both in the air and on the ground, but this was totally silent and only going perhaps 30 or 40 mph.  It would have passed directly under BWI landing pattern traffic landing that night from the north, NW of Baltimore.<n>

As I sat back in a chair I saw some thing glint in the sky.

We were all stund to witness this phenomenon. We sat for over an hour watching the sightings, we were spellbound, so intriguing and unbelievable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To see the speed which they moved was unbelievable, after an hour or so it started to cloud up and I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening when my son was visiting some friends up the road he rang me to say the UFO&#39;s were there again at around 10pm.

They don&#39;t make contrails, and they don&#39;t have wings or make a sound. Planes are not multi directional and can hover in suspended motion. they are of a shape like a ball, and they are a bright reddish orange at night, and by day they are white, because extreme hot surfaces tend to have a white tint to it. And when I said it left at a high rate of speed, It left the earth at a high rate of speed. This is the fourth sighting of this particular UFO, and they all left the earth at extreme speeds. They come and go!...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

It kept rotating back and forth and would travel a distance of about four to five miles in about five seconds.

It kept doing this for about 30 minutes and then disapeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the possibility of an advertising light would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the lights were caused by genuine UFO&#39;s.

2/6/05 23:57|Napa|CA|Light|3 minutes|Orange light slowly travels across the sky and rapidly ejects smaller lights downward from it, before disappearing.|2/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41827.html|225|ndxe200502| Orange light slowly travels across the sky and rapidly ejects smaller lights downward from it, before disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just come home from work and was unloading my car, making several trips into the house.  I noticed an orange point of light in the North sky close to the horizon.  It was the approximate brightness of aircraft headlights.  At first I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it, but as I noticed the light gradually moving in my general direction, the orangeness of the light struck me as being odd, as aircraft have white headlights, red strobe lights, red and green wingtip lights, and white wingtip strobes.  This had none of those lights required by the FAA.  I also started to notice that although this light was moving a bit slower than a satellite, it&#39;s speed kept changing.  Just enough to notice.  It would speed up and slow down as it moved from North to South.  As it got closer I kept listening, but never heard any engines or any noise at all.  I also noticed that it began swerving slightly and it&#39;s overall direction changed to a Southeasterly direction.  The intensity of the light remained constant.  It got to a point where it was as close to me as it was going to get and was now moving left to right.  It was a mostly clear night, with a few patchy areas of stratus clouds.  A couple of times this object passed behind a cloud and could still see some light through it.  It&#39;s altitude was hard to guess, but high enough to be above the low clouds.  At it&#39;s closest point, it was about 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon.  By this time I had run into to house to retrieve a pair of binoculars to get a better look at this.  I focused in on it, and it was a solid orange point of light.  It left no vapor or smoke trail.  As it moved southeast I suddenly saw a smaller &#34;piece&#34; of the orange light fall or get ejected downward from the object.  The odd thing is, the &#34;piece&#34; kept the same forward velocity as the parent object as it fell rapidly downward, so it did not lag behind or trail as it fell.  Once it fell, it quickly twinkled out.  Then I saw another piece drop, and then another, in the same exact fashion.  Then the parent object quickly faded out into the blackness of the night sky.  Nothing further was seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Had this been a satellite or space junk burning up in the atmosphere, any pieces breaking off would stay together and slowly drift apart.  The &#34;piece&#34; was moving downward at about the same speed as it was moving forward.  Not sure what to make of this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

As I looked up I saw an airplane flying from my left to the right. Just then I saw two orange lights moving in a circular motion glided from my right to my left. It lasted about 10 to 15 seconds. I couldn&#39;t be sure because I was standing in awe of what I just saw. The lights were dim or glimmer, not sure which word to use. The lights then faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I now call Sirius &#34;my star&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had just purchased a brand new digital camera (Kodak Easyshare CX7430) and as it was a clear night I was out in the back garden taking photos of my dog running round when I spotted Sirius.  I though i&#39;d try and grab a shot of it even though it was probably impossible as it is so far away.  &#39;<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I uploaded the photos i&#39;d taken, in amongst them was the photo I have attached.  The orbs are caused by the damp weather but who knows what the other thing is.

2/5/05 21:15|Whitehorse (Canada)|YT|Light|15 mins|3rd witness report on Whitehorse, Yukon sighting of Feb 5/05|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43931.html|230|ndxe200502| 3rd witness report on Whitehorse, Yukon sighting of Feb 5/05<n> <n><n> <n><n> This information was sent to ufoyukon@ufobc.ca on February 6/05. I will repeat what I wrote in my original e-mail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;Tonight- Saturday - at 9:15pm I went outside for a smoke and did so on the backdoor stoop - which faces east, north and south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the horizon to the east (added - from Mary Lake subdivision)I briefly saw a light low on the horizon but obscured by trees - thinking a star. I moved slightly to to look for it again but did not see it. A few minutes later again saw a light briefly but again it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later a light appeared from the east in the direction I had seen before along with another, following.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both lights were of the same intensity and both were of a reddish colour about 3 times the brightness of the planet in the ESE at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both lights followed each other, slowly. First impression was of 2 helicopters coming in to land at the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no flashing lights, just a reddish light common to both with no apparent difference in intensity nor quality.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Followed the lights, measured the distance between then when above (as high as an uparm salute {80 degree arc?}as the distance of 3/4 of my index finger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight path came from the east deviating in a northerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When at their highest but to my left both lights stopped. The lead light then turned north (and at this time a small meteor came from the east) and within a short distance faded altogether.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other light then continued on its flight path - easterly/northerly - and I had to step off the stoop to go to the edge of my deck {16&#39;} as the roof of the {2 storey} housebegan to obscure the light. The light then continued for a short while until it too faded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am assuming that perhaps this was a satellite insertion of some sort. However the colour of the lights and slow speed were not something I have seen before in reference to satellites nor the direction. Other satellite insertions have been from the south to north - where rocket/satellite separate at relatively high speeds/altitudes and with a colour of usual satellite observation - ie white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea of the altitude of the reddish lights. Difficult to judge without knowing the size of the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound involved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally at 11.45pm there were 2 meteors coming from the north - the first with quite a &#34;head&#34; to be followed seconds later by a smaller one.&#34; I live in Wolf Creek Rural Residential Subdivision which is located 1 mile west of the Mary Lake Subdivision mentioned in one of the reports on this incident and my property is on the eastern boundary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This area is on one of the flight paths into Whitehorse airport and on the flight path of Anchorage flights to the east and reverse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There are numerous satellites traversing overhead and dependent upon reflection can be very bright or quite dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

This was puzzeling to me because the Sun was brightly shining.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch and after a few moments it began slowing moving westward very slowly, at this point, I became bewildered and went to the pool attendent, an aquaintance, and asked him to confirm the sighting which he did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then others at the pool became engaged as we observed the object moving at varialble speeds but always slowly as it made a lazy arc to the north east.  We watched it maybe for 7-10 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were in the midst of high rises and a cloud passed by and afterward it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all were perplexed and I am a strong sceptic but I have no rational explanation for this and neither did any of the others who saw it.  I was somewhat entralled but others were somewhat nonchalant about it which astonished me almost as much as the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night I had dreams of UFOs so I guess it had an impact on my mind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had to share this with others.  I am so amazed and in a way grateful for this experience, to witness the unknown.<n>
2/5/05 09:15|Whitehorse (Canada)|YT|Fireball|6 minutes|Two very large Orange Orbs Hovering directly over our House, Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42168.html|232|ndxe200502| Two very large Orange Orbs Hovering directly over our House, Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada<n> <n><n> <n><n> Posted below was my actual email to the ufoyukon@ufobc.ca website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then i have figured out that it was 9:15 because i dialed 411 at 9:21 to get a friends phone # to tel them to look up at the these lights  Also since then we have figured out that the lights wer emaybe the size of 1 or 2 737&#39;s as the other night we saw a plane fly over our house and the size of the plane allowed us to roughly determine the size of what we saw..as what we saw was maybe 300-500 feet away from our house (we live in the country in total darkness with no city lights or anything) and the tops of the trees and part of the gorund covered in snow was lit up orange...<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> On the tuesday after our house (wife, fatherinlaw, motherinlaw and I) saw this a friend phoned me and mentioned her husbands two contractor buddies and a couple children at a group home about two streets over or maybe 8 acres away saw the exact same thing.  I was told by my friend that they were so scared they hid under their house until it moved away as they thought it was going to crash into thier house (that is how close it was) ..when it slowly moved away (which was towards my house ) they came back out and watched it slowly move away and stop and then shoot straight to space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> i have phoned them a couple times but i am afraid they are still to scared to talk about what happened...these two objects were so close to our house and i guess their it was unbelievable...it was truly unbelievable and has changed my life forever...<n> <n><n> <n><n> on the wednesday after our sighting...in iqaluit (nunavut) CBC reported a story of two bright orange lights over that city following each other and sounded like a mirror image of what we saw that night....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also since talking to the UFO BC web site people...i have read recently that there was 2 other sightsing out here in teh past 7 years....similar story...<n> <n><n> <n><n> All i can say is i wish i could talk to somebody to understand what we saw...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again there was no sound...and also since talking it over many times we both agreed we saw a red lights in the middle as it got closer and top and bottom was the orange...<n> <n><n> <n><n> the strangest part i will never forget was wathcing it go away...it didnt go north, south east or west...it went UP...i had goosebumps the size of elephants on every inch of my skin...<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) 867-((telephone number deleted))   *******************  Saturday night February 5, 2005    9:25pm<n> <n><n> <n><n> Watching TV.  went to check aurora Borealis predictions for father-in-law at about 9:25pm tonight.  Came back into living room where I told him that tonight would be a good night to see the green northern lights.  Took a peek outside to see if it was actually clear and two quite large VERY ORANGE lights were slowing coming towards the house very slowly.  They seemed side by side and we noticed no other flashing lights or anything.  We heard absolutely no sound from the outside as we looked towards the weird lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued to approach the house ( we live in Mary Lake Country Residential Subdivision, 15 minutes outside of Whitehorse Yukon).  They went ot he side of our house and we watched them for maybe 5 minutes as they just seem to hang around outside slowly moving away.  The lights then came really close to each other, then one went up , the other went down, and vice versa.  Then the right light slowly appeared to move farther away with the other light following the first light.  The lights didn’t go further away but rather straight up.  Then one just disappeared completely.  Then the last one just sat there way up in the sky and appeared to have some additional colors flashing    I ran back downstairs as I went upstairs to watch them move away.   I got back, the other one had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart is still beating fast.  I have never seen something so silent, so bright, so close just float by my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather :-30  Wind, nil; clouds, none    Never had such a weird feeling, and as I write this I remember the TV flickered a bit just before I saw these northern lights, but they were not the lights I originally looked outside to see?    If you hear of others this night please email.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A couple years ago I thought I saw a disc shaped object by a fox lake we have up here but thought nothing of it..till now.  That one also disappeared.quickly    Have a nice night!    ((name deleted))<n>

Whilst going to toilet they looked up to see 3 large bright lights, too bright and low to be stars. The lights were independent and lined up on top of each other with the top light  slightly off to one side. Suddenly fighter planes began approaching the lights from three different directions and at this point the middle light began to flash very quickly blinking on/off. All three lights simply faded out by the time the planes had reached the point in the sky where they were located.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It looked like a comet southeast of Fort Smith over Fort Chaffee headed southeast. At firstI thought it was a flare and then a plane coming in and then the moon shinning through a hole in the clouds since the sky was cloudy and no stars were shinning.I waited and no plane ever came in. It had a light on the head of it and a tail that looked just like a comet. It finally just faded away and disapeared. NO noise, it was to far away probably 2-3 miles, but it had to be really big.This is the second strange thing I have seen in the sky in my life. P.S. I do not believe in UFOs never have and never will, but I do enjoy reading this site for entertainment. I think it&#39;s funny. Anyway I thought I would report it. Maybe someone else saw this and knows what it was.If so please post I would like to know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  If the object had a &#34;tail,&#34; it could not have been the planet, Venus.  Also, if the time duration estimate is correct, it almost certainly would not have been a contrail behind a high-altitude jet, we believe.  PD))<n>

I saw an object hovering very high in the sky above my property.  It looked like it could be an airplane but it was not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a white light in the middle and two red lights on either side of it. I thought it was odd that it did not move naturally like an airplane as I continued to stare at it, it finally moved over my home and out of my sight.  My son thinks it is US government doing testing.  I agree.  We also live close to the Philadelphia airport.<n>

I was outside, getting ready to take a drive up to the mountains, when I happened to look up, just in time to watch a light briefly streak across the sky. At first I thought that it may have been a meteor, but then I realized that it did&#39;nt have a trail behind it. Usually, this is the case. But, there was no trail, or anything else! The light was moving WNW to SSE at about 40 degrees above the horizon. Could have been a meteor, but since there was no trail...!<n>

My daughter pointed towards the left at two big, bright, white lights, resembling headlights in the sky. I slowed down and watched it glide towards us. It had a smaller white light in the back, with no strobing lights, and appeared to be triangular in shape. I parked as it was gliding upwards behind trees. I had the window rolled down and did not hear noise coming from the object. It then moved away from us, completly behind the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Second report from daughter.

I was approaching the Port Orchard airport when I saw 2 bright white lights (looked like headlights) ahead and to my right. The object was flying low. The object then turned right (my left) and traveled directly over my car. There were the two bright white lights in the front, one smaller white light in the back, and two small red lights in the center. The object appeared to be triangular in shape. There were no strobing lights and no sound that I could detect. This happened at 18:40.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I returned home, I called my daughter and she reported seeing what sounds like the same object on her way home. She sighted the object at the other end of Sidney Road as she traveled from downtown Port Orchard toward Tremont Ave. She saw two bright white lights on her left. The object was traveling to her left, then appeared to go upward and then turned right to the direction of Seattle.

I looked up to take a look at the plane as I always do, and right above the flight path of the plane I noticed a sphere shaped object glistening in the sunlight. It was probably at 2,000 - 3,000 feet hovering motionless. I stood there staring at if for approximately 1 minute and then it began emitting a rainbow of colors, very intense and bright and it definitely had a pattern to it. I waved my arms, convinced that whatever was occupying this unknown object had intelligent life forms aboard it. It then began to move westward and then took off at amazing speed. Nothing significant, but it was something unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

2/4/05 00:00|Phoenix|AZ|Rectangle|1-2 minutes|UFO Sighting on North Mountain in Phoenix|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45528.html|248|ndxe200502| UFO Sighting on North Mountain in Phoenix<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting was on North Mountain in Phoenix.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I used to climb to the top of North Mountain every night for excersize. Coming down one night, I saw what I first thought was an airplane, but it came closer and it looked like it had slowed down quite a bit, ruling out an airplane, at which point I thought it was a helicopter and became alarmed (sometimes police helicopters fly over North Mountain park, which closes at 11:00 PM, I did not want to be &#34;spot lighted&#34;). I was eyeing the aircraft very closely to see if it was in fact a helicopter and because it was approaching North Mountain.  It was flying very slowly at some point, and I was looking directly at it, trying to make it out against a black sky. I caught the first glimpse of its shape, it had lights on it, like a helicopter would, but the rear of the aircraft was square.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I became very confused, trying to figure out what kind of aircraft was &#39;square&#39;. Also, it was very quiet, helicopters make a lot of noise, even from a distance, this one wasnt making any noise at all. I continued to stare at the aircraft, caught a second glipse of it, and the shape looked definitely square from the back end (couldnt make out the front end because of the lights on the aircraft). At this point, I became nervous, I was starting to panic, I moved into a dark area off the paved road under a small &#34;ridge&#34; to keep myself from being seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft flew nearly overhead from where I was standing, and it literally dipped down towards the gorge area, flew back up a little and circled around the peak across the gorge (this was the peak where the radio antennas are located). The aircraft must have not been more than 50 feet from me at one instant. It was black and sqare shaped aircraft, made a quiet turbine machine like noise, I had no idea of what this was, but it was &#34;right in my face&#34;, so to speak, and I was mortally terrified. What went through my mind in that instant was not good, I was really scared, I wanted to run away at full speed down the mountain towards the apartments where I lived. I just wanted to get out of there, quick, but I also realized that any movements might cause me to be detected by whatever that aircraft was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the aircraft circled around the North Mountain peak, I did not see it again. I was worried that it might circle back around, but it didnt. I somehow consoled myself by thinking that whatever that was, it was not looking for me. After a few minutes, I started back down the road briskly in an effort to get to the other side of the ridge, so if it did circle back around then I would be obscured from its path. On the way down, I considered calling the police when I got back to my apartment, but then I realized that I wouldnt have been taken seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to climb North Mountain after that, but only in daylight hours. I didnt think running into something like that would ever happen again, however, the incident had shaken me up pretty badly and I did avoid climbing up at night after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Previous to this incident, I did not believe in UFOs and when somebody mentioned it I would go so far as to get upset and try to prove to them that they do not exist and it is impossible by the laws of physics to cover great distances in anyones lifetime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After witnessing this, it is obvious to me that they do exist because I saw one, although I dont understand it or how it could be possible. But I still saw it. i can speculate that maybe the reason why it was flying over that area was because of the radio antennas? At any rate, I had a close up visual of the aircraft, it was not a helicopter, and it could not be anything else because of its extremely low altitude at the final moment of the sighting. Aside from the fact that helicopters are obvious and make a great deal of noise, not even a helicopter would fly that low in that area because of electric lines that go across the mountains (danger of hitting an electic line).<n>
2/3/05 22:30|Colorado Springs|CO|Circle|20 minutes|Bright white ball flew from west to east, did strange manuevers over and around Polaris.|2/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41804.html|249|ndxe200502| Bright white ball flew from west to east, did strange manuevers over and around Polaris.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was round and white--not like an airplane at all. I looked out my back window and noticed something flying high, because there was a few jets flying by--making lots of noise...weird time to be flying jets! When i looked out the window, it slowly went from west to south east, and it appeared to be far away. I went outside a few minutes later to see it better, and because it had dissapeared from my window view. It was fairly nice outside, only misty-looking clouds in the north west. It went slightly past (I think) Polaris, to the left, then made a manuever to the right, which seemed too unreal for a plane to do.... It seemed to hover in the south east sky for about five minutes--and for thirty seconds or so, seemed to be coming toward my direction, then went back again. Then, after going around in a weird centricity, it seemed to still, right in front of what I believe to be Polaris. It did the strangest thing: it appeared to fly at the same rate as Polaris(?) was moving across the sky. I went in becauseit was cold for gloves, and when I came back, Polaris(?) was less intense--it was alone now.... Anyway,It was like a glowing ball of light. I watched for another hour outside on and off; and even brought out a map of the sky for positioning. But the map I have is for January--don&#39;t know if that was Polaris! I&#39;m not into astronomy or aliens except to read sci-fi! I watched two airplanes cross the southeast sky afterward. Gave me a good idea of how close it was: not as close as an airplane--that&#39;s for sure! It never seemed to blink, too; not like the stars or airplane lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
2/3/05 21:30|Fort Collins|CO|Triangle|9 seconds|Triangle craft spotted in Fort Collins Colorado|2/22/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41841.html|250|ndxe200502| Triangle craft spotted in Fort Collins Colorado<n> <n><n> <n><n> My name is ((name deleted)) and I live in Fort Collins, Colorado.  On February 3rd around 9:30pm I had went out back to smoke a cigarette.  It was a very clear night, not a cloud in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My backyard is on the north side of my house.  I was looking up at the stars because the sky was so clear.  As I was looking a large craft appeared over my head.  It was the shape of an equilateral triangle and was heading NNW.  About 20 degrees to my left of where I was standing.  It made no sound as it traveled.  The craft&#39;s bottom was all I could see.  The base color was black with a hint of grey.  In each of the three corners, not the tips, were three circles that gave off a very dim blue-white light.  It was just the outlines of the circles that gave off the light.  The centers of each circle were the same color as the rest of the bottom.  I remember thinking that craft was so geometrical.  The inner circles were also in an equilateral triangle configuration.  That is if the center of each circle were the points of a triangle.  It felt as if the craft was very close, 200-300 feet over my head.  But as there were no clouds to judge distance with I really don&#39;t know.  My view to the North of my house is blocked by the town-homes that are directly to the north of my house.  I estimate that I can only see the sky above 50 degrees from the ground.  The craft traveled over my head till I couldn&#39;t see it for what I estimate to be 9 seconds.  I never took my eyes off of it, I felt stunned to be watching it.  If I were to held my hand out as far as I can open palmed it would have not have fully covered my view of the triangle.  After it had passed I went inside and told my roommates what I had seen.  I grabbed a pen and paper and noted the time on my microwave:  9:32 PM.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then grabbed my video camera and went outside to see if it would return and I could capture it on film.  This time I went out the front of my house and into a field that borders my neighborhood to the South.  I did not see the object again.  I did note however that there seemed to be a lot of smaller planes flying around in the area.  I could see the lights on the planes and could hear their engines.  I noted that one plane was circling the town in my area a half a dozen times while I was in the field.<n>

Then I realized how big it was, how low it was in the sky. It had quite a long streaming tail which appeared gaseous.  The trail was fairly long, about 3x the diameter of the main object. The main object, at arms length I would say was the size of a nickel. It looked exactly like a comet.  It was reddish in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving from East to West, horizontal to the ground although it looked like it was going to come down.  It did not move in any erratic patterns. I ran towards it but lost view of it behind trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I realized there was no impact...I pretty much ruled out that it was a meteor.  I did see a private jet flying into Scottsdale airport at that exact moment. The pilot of the jet had to have seen it.<n>

We were at a stoplight with considerable light pollution (i.e. yellow street lights, commercial signs, etc.) and were looking straight ahead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both saw a bright, steady white light move from the middle right of the windshield to the upper left (East to West) at a high rate of speed-it crossed the windshield in less than 1 second. It dissappeared into the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared to be slightly larger than the size of Jupitor or Venus seen on a dark night. There was no flickering, fading or sparking as I&#39;ve seen with meteorites before, and the angle of travel seemed inconsistant with an object entering the atmosphere, or even skipping across the upper atmosphere. It looked to be ascending.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The steadiness and clear whiteness of the light gave us the impression it was artificial. The speed, however, was astonishing. We had the impression the light was a good distance away (meaning more than a few hundred yards-seemed like a few miles at least), but have no idea of true distance or speed-just that it was very, very fast. There wasn&#39;t any sonic boom or other noise we could associate with it.<n>

I had my friend look at it too and she saw it in the binoculars as well.  Then I looked up the street that we were standing on and there was another blinking light off in the distance that wasn&#39;t moving either.  The lights were both staying in the same places for the whole entire night and I can go out on a clear night and point them out to anyone who might be able to explain what it is.

While stopped at the light which is unusually long timed I noticed a contrail a short distance moving slowly through the sky. It was of a short length and the object emitting the contrail could not be seen. What made it unusual was that the entire contrail appeared to be moving slowly across the sky and not being left behind and dissapating. I pointed this out to my wife and children and collectively we noticed another 4 contrails of what appeared to be identical lengths spaced out into the distance. The sun was setting in the west at the time but the day was clear and would definitely be considered a daytime event. The closest contrail appeared to totally disappear at least twice but reappeared seconds later. There were some wires crossing the road at the traffic signal and I moved my head up and down to make sure that the &#34;disappearance&#34; was not caused by the visual obstruction of the wires. It was not, the contrail totally disappeared and reappeared at least twice though the heading and travelling distance appeared to remain approximately consistent during the disappearance/ reappearance. In general the contrails appeared to be moving in a generally counterclockwise direction to where Kennedy and LaGuardia airport would lie about 50 miles to the west. Three were heading towards us and two were moving toward the north or right of us. I am not qualified to judge the actual distances but the closest contrail was certainly close enough to us that a plane at the front of the contrail should have been easy to see. Yet as hard as we tried we could not see one. Can anybody tell me if they noticed this daytime display, do the airports &#34;hold&#34; planes in clockwise or counterclockwise directions, is there some type of visual phenomenom that can cause a reflection of some type during the setting of the sun that could cause this?  The observers were a typical family of Husband/Wife and four children ranging from 7-17 yrs of age.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I would like to say that I was witness to another sighting, that appeared on ABC News, the one that took place in New Jersey. I got home about an hour before. I was kind of bored, so I look out my window. In the sky, I saw what looked like vertical lines in the clouds. I would have not given it another look, but the clouds were greyish-blue, the lines were almost a gold. Then one by one more rips appeared. One was headed towards the Verazanno Bridge(for those who don&#39;t know, a pretty large suspension bridge). There were two orbs near the bridge. Then every one of the &#34;lines&#34; went from vertical to horizontal, and became fireballs, almost like jets. I thought, maybe I&#39;m seeing things, they&#39;re just jets, but the jet-trail dissapeared, almost like a comet. The one by the bridge slowly moved, and the two spheres dissapeared, and that one line kind of just drifted, but eventually it went out of my line of sight, due to a tree, and that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

About 3 football fields big.  Everything was dead silent, and a feeling of fear grips us.  We couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing.  We were on a wooded highway with very little traffic at this time of night.  The object was moving silently just above the tree tops.  We were so scared.  I began to drive very fast away from the object.  We became very sleepy shortly after this event and pulled over in a church parking lot to rest. When we awoke 3hours had passed.  The rest of our drive was spent pretty much in silence, until we arrived home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I see this light in the south eastern sky after dark on a very regular basis, any night that is clear it is about 40 degrees above the horizon. The light at first glance looks like any other star but if you fixate your eye to the other stars in the area, this one twinkles more AND it has motion up down and left right. The color as best I can describe is like a police car light bar red/white/blue at great distance. I can&#39;t tell how far away the object is. I have observed this light with 2 other witnesses at different times. I do not think it is a planet, air craft or satellite. I do see aircraft in the sky occasionally when I see this object. My guess would be that it can be seen from Connecticut and Mass also. It would seem that the object could be off the coast over the Atlantic Ocean but I cant be shure of this. I would like to hear if anyone else from the RI, CT or MA area has seen this.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were getting in the car anyway and decided to follow them as best as we could.  We noticed them only for a couple of minutes and then lost sight of them.

We noticed another one north east about the same altitude, at first I thought it was a illusion from the gases in the atmosphere and decided to wait  an hour and see if it was a star or plane, an hour later they were almost over head both at their same distance apart. the next clear night the exact same thing occurred again and again a neighbor told me that they are pulsars and another said they are satellites. But now I have the whole street looking at them on every clear night. I recently went to Long Island , New York and I could see them there as well. Again on a clear night if you look east an hour after sunset about 20 degrees up from the horizon you&#39;ll see them one N.E. and one S.E.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of star, Sirius.

Objects were to far apart. Also, if there were 5 planes in the air that close there should have been some noise, there was no sound. Late afternoon, clear sky, watched for 15 to 25 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Spread accross full view of horizon moving very slow, no noise noticed, towards a large purple cloud on horizon. Objects reamind first spotted while driving. Seen first 2 objects first for 10 miles (give or take) along state route 93 comming from Otsego towards Adamsville. Pulled over roadside to take pictures, at this time we observed 5 objects definatly and watched for another 10/15 minutes. Ojects were still on horizon almost out of sight when we returned to vehicle and headed on towards our home. Camera was in hand from taking photos at a nearby real estate property.

The object was dark except for a lighted area in the lower lefthand quadrant.  The lighted area was changing from silver to orange and back at a rate of about 5 to 7 seconds per cycle.  I observed this object for about three minutes and it appeared to be stationary with respect to the contrail and was at about 60 degrees off of the horizon slightly west of due south.  I pulled the binoculars away from my eyes expecting to see it with the naked eye but could not and was not able to locate it thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Renton Airport to see if they had observed anything on radar at that time.  They explained that their radar does not have the range to locate anything in that area (South Kent to North Auburn) and directed me to the Seattle Air Traffic Center.  I called them and left a message but have not heard back at this time.  The person I talked with at the Renton Airport was very interested and asked if I would give him a call back if anything was noted by the Seattle Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By way of background I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Above the clouds very blue sky. Flight left Newark at approx 7:45am due to snow delay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At about 8:00 - 8:15 the plane was above the clouds, sky was very blue.  Seen a light very far away with numerous other lights moving around it, sort of circling.  Very hard to keep an eye on them as the contrast and distance made it difficult to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed this main object (all objects seemed white) move up and down, sometimes slightly to the left.  Various times, I had seen other lights move around this main light at higher speeds, until they just seemed to disappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very difficult to keep track, kind of like looking at a sea gull at a high altitude on a bright sunny CLEAR day. The white on blue makes it hard to see, especially at great distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was I saw, I know it was NOT a plane or aircraft as we know it. The movements where just to odd. Personally I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes, before I had a chance to get confirmation from the person beside me we started descending on our approach to Toronto Airpot.<n>

I was actually on an alarm call (I am a police officer) in a large industrial area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard what sounded like the noise (wind, exhaust, but not an engine) of an aircraft.  Not alarmed at first because there is an airport a couple of miles away.  But I turned around to see that the noise was right over me, and though I could not see a &#34;ship&#34; or &#34;craft&#34; I could tell that something was distorting the view of the sky.  Kind of like a cloaking or camoflauge of some type.  I also observed it to hover low, less than 100 ft, and appear (based on the noise and movement of the grass and bushes) to circle the building I was at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This building was an abandoned telephone office complex that is close to a Lockheed Martin facility.  As far as I know, this place only builds aircraft metal parts such as cowlings for the B52 bomber and other pieces.  The adress of the building I was at is 1222 MCI Drive, the old MCI building that has been vacant for several years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what else to say, other than you could not see the object, but I KNEW it was flying and hovering and could tell when it departed.  It went due south and out of the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I went back to my police cruiser, the engine was dead.  I always leave it running, as it was chilly on this night.  I also had to restart my MDC (Mobile Data Computer) as it had shut down.  It would not work the rest of the shift and had to be turned in for repairs.  I have not heard what was wrong with it, but I DID NOT tell anyone about the incident.<n>
