I was alone in the car, I had to urinate and was speeding towards a rest area I knew was thirty three miles ahead.  There were no other vehicles around me when I saw to my right out in the fields paralleling the interstate a very bright light.  I looked into it and it appeared to be a combine working in the field and loading a big truck.  At the moment of this incident I thought it odd this would be going on in the middle of the night and that the light could blind someone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the combine and big dump type truck seemed to be Tonka type toy&#39;s.  Then the rest area was at hand and I realized I had to urinate quite badly.  I slowed and followed the rest area road info the parking lot and parked.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I did so another smaller car followed mine and parked to my left and the driver got out and hurried over to my car as I was opening the door and he said &#34;did you see them?&#34; I said &#34;see what?&#34;  He said &#34;the bright lights following your car.&#34;  I said &#34;no, but I did see the combine with the light shinning on the highway&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> he said &#34;not that, the round lights that were all around your car?&#34;   I said &#34;no , just the combine and I have to use the toilet fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to the rest room and when I came back I went to the passenger side of his car and a woman put the window down and there were three children in the back seat.  The woman and the three girls in the back seat were obviously frightened.  The woman asked me again if I had seen the lights and I told her the same as I had told her husband.  &#34;No, I only saw the combine light but that it had held me and I did not remember the last thirty three miles.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told them not to be afraid, if whatever it was wanted to harm us it would have, and all I accomplished was to further frighten the children.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got back to my car and headed back north on I-5 to a motel in Stockton.  As I was trying to sleep I felt as though I had been one with that light.  I&#39;ll never be sure how long I was with the light, I know I lost attention with the road for at least thirty miles at 80mph.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the years since I see the combine and truck as toy&#39;s and feel as though I was encapsulated by the light.<n>

However, this &#34;aircraft&#34; was not flying and/or adhering to any of the air traffic patterns or speeds I was accustomed to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will also add that the pattern of lights (they were white)I mentioned, which seemingly defined the object(s) leading edge, did not blink or even appear to twinkle due to any atmospheric distortion (it was a very clear night though).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Furthermore, I never heard a sound. In summary, what I saw is the first and only thing I&#39;ve ever seen in flight, in thirty plus years, that I can say without hesitation, I don&#39;t know what it was.  In fact, I only came across this site trying to find some information for a friend who is interested in UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, what led me to doing this posting is that in looking through the data, out of curiosity I looked back to 1994 to see if anyone had posted a sighting similar to mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, lo and behold, I found a Riverside, CA, event on 10/11/94 in which the description of the object (chevron), with the farmost lights from center offset a bit) matches what I saw in 8/94 in San Diego, perfectly.<n>

They seemed very amazed, so I asked to take a look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw one disc shaped object dart in a reverse &#39;z&#39; direction.  The object looked very bright in the sight, so it must have been very hot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened quite a few years ago, but I recall that the tower had been listening to us and said (after laughing), &#34;I hope you don&#39;t want anyone to think you believe in UFO&#39;s.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> After that comment, we never really talked about what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Near the kankeke river.  was as big as four tennis courts stacked two side by side end to end. Shaped like a triangle. The reason i saw this object was, because i was shooting off fire works rockets and looked up to see why one of the fire works did&#39;nt exsplode.I was standing near a weeping willow tree that stood at least 65ft high.  As i looked up it apeared that part of the sky began to rotate slowly. This is what caught my eye at the same time i heard what sounded like a &#39;&#39;humm&#39;&#39; like a high voltage transformer as i continued to look at this object it apeared to have stars on the out side as if to hide..  it apeared to have some dim light comming from it&#39;s seams. As it moved out   over the river it droped behind the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole insident was just above the tree top.  I have kept this to my self for all these years. Because i didn&#39;t think any one would except this story .  But i know it happened.<n>

This light was pretty far away, straight in front of us, from our vantage point just peeking over the tree tops.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was an airplane tower light but it seemed too bright and high.  My husband asked, &#34;What is that?&#34; and we started to explain it away-plane, helicopter, etc..  Then it moved straight up and straight to the left and repeated this movement as if going up stairs a couple of times, until it was high in the sky, like a very bright star, in front and slightly to the left of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we were talking to each other- is it some military helicopter or UFO or what? Also at this point we were driving on a straight road and we had slowed down considerably.  Then the light dimmed from a bright white to a orangish color and began moving in a straight line directly to us.  It was weird because it was very far away and we never took our eyes off it but it was right on top of us too quickly.  It was like it moved very slowly and steadily yet it got to us faster than it should have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we had stopped in the middle of this road and turned off the headlights.  There was no one else around. The UFO stopped and hovered directly above our car and slightly to the left about 20 ft.? above us.  I&#39;m not that great with measuring distance but it was right on top of us. It was about 4 or 5 times the size of our thunderbird turbo coupe, Triangular with rounded edges, apparently black in color and had many lights on the bottom.  Because it was right on top of us we couldn&#39;t see the top but it did appear to have a &#34;windshield&#34; on one of the points facing the same direction we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no noise, created no wind that I could tell and even though it had lights it didn&#39;t give off light or light anything up.  It was slowly turning back and forth (left and right) but not all the way around.  From the time it reached us to the time my husband stuck the car in gear and went peeling down the road was probably only 30 seconds or so.  I felt like an animal, we were both crying and panicing.  The UFO crossed over the top of our car so that it was on the right side. To the right(out my window) was pasture and the UFO was flying at the level of my window-4 or 5 ft. off the ground (?) and seemed to be playing a game with us, it would stay along side the car, then back off and catch back up, shoot ahead and wait for us, etc.. this lasted about a minute or 2.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking from it to my husband who was trying to drive and screaming at him to get away.  At one point I looked back and it was gone.  We made a right turn and I was looking in the sky and found it looking like a bright star again, about 1 minute after it had disappeared.  We made another right turn so as it was directly in front of us, high in the sky and it just dove down into the trees at an extremely fast speed.  That was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband is a plumber and I am a stay at home mom.  I wished for a long time that this didn&#39;t happen.  I&#39;ve gotten past it now and try not to think about it too much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We became lost for two to three hours down a rural country roads in or around Swanton OH.  As we were driving I noticed lights within the trees which were brighter than normal house lights but I paid no mind thinking it was a house or cabin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approx two hundred yards from the trees we came across a corn field at which time my sister&#39;s friend slammed on the brakes and said ,&#34; What is THAT?&#34;   As I looked I noticed aprrox 25 yards away from the road was two story house with a large barn and a combine and approx ten to twenty feet above the house was an object shaped like a football beaming different color lights.  We immediately stopped and starred in disbelief as we tried to figure out what we were looking at.  In my mind, I ruled out all known hovering vehicles such as blimps or helicopters.  This football shaped object made no noise, created no wind, and was approx half the size of the house.  We all became terrorified as my sister&#39;s friend drove slowly passed the house.  I looked to my right and noticed a State Trooper parked with no lights also watching the object.  At that time, my sister&#39;s friend did the quarter mile in what seemed like ten seconds.  I told her to slow down because of the Trooper.  As we slowed I looked out the back window of the car and saw three identical object approx five hundred yards behind us which was ten to twenty feet over electrical wires in formation moving slowly across the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have told few people of this story and the people I have told do not believe the me or poke fun.  My sister who is now a devote Christian denies these events.  I was sixteen years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since then I have served four years in the Marine Corps in a line unit, flown and seen many helicopters, and witnessed many things in the military.  However, with all that I have experienced I know what I saw that night.  I know this was not a helicopter because helicopters while stationary cause enormous down drafts, in fact hurricane force winds.  I&#39;m not saying it was little green men from Mars, it was by definition UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not amazed or awestruck by the objects, only frightened at something I could not identify or explain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

8/25/94 11:45|New York City|NY|Egg|5 Mins +|Observation of egg blimp shapped object in front of World Trade Center Towers, NY.  Possibly a second sighting.|6/21/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13136.html|11|ndxe199408| Observation of egg blimp shapped object in front of World Trade Center Towers, NY.  Possibly a second sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have pasted the sighting information I am referring to at the end of my account regarding same.  I respond to this as a possible additional witness to this event, my account is as follows:<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working as a long haul truck driver and viewed this &#34;thing&#34; from the north bound New Jersey Turnpike, off and on, between Newark International Airport and exit 3 where I was to exit the turnpike, and proceed west to my destination.  My reference to seeing the object &#34;off and on&#34;, has to do with observing it, and continuing to drive the vehicle, not that the object would disappear and reappear.  I too am unsure of the exact date, however, after coming across this, I will be digging out my old log books to pinpoint it precisely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to view it consistently for about 3 or 4 minutes when I had to sit stopped in traffic at exit 3.  It was at this time I was also able to further verify, in my mind, that I was seeing something, I did not know what it was.  I even tried to see if the event was being reported on the FM radio in the truck by hitting the scan button, as well as a radio scanner I had in the vehicle, finally, of course the C.B.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My search of the airwaves on the radios yielded nothing out of the ordinary.  I also wondered if any one in New York City was looking up that day since I was not hearing outside news of this event. This &#34;thing&#34; was egg or blimp shaped and dull silver in color.  It was, from my vantage point at exit 3, hovering then moving slowly forward and back, in front of the World Trade Center Towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I observed it during my travel from where I first saw it, (Newark International Airport), until I got stopped in traffic at exit 3, I figured it was a small blimp, or balloon used for advertising.  When I got stopped in traffic at exit 3 and able to study the object closer, IE: with out distraction, I assured myself it was NOT a blimp or a balloon.  It had no fins, no control gondola, no appendages of any kind that you would expect to see on a balloon or blimp, nor did it have any advertising on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch this &#34;thing&#34; a white Bell Jet Ranger helicopter approached it, and appeared to be in close proximity to it.  The object would have been about 2.5-3.5 times the size of the helicopter that was approaching it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to see what happened next, as the helicopter continued to approach, since traffic started to move.  When I was able to again direct my attention back to the object, a minute or so later, it, and the helicopter, were gone.  The weather was clear and sunny that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is not the first time I have seen an object like this, the last time was in 93 just west of Deming NM, and south of I-10.  At least I have one nagging question answered regarding this, if we did indeed see the same thing, at least I was not the only one looking up that day!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Occurred : 8/25/94 12:00 (Entered as : 08/25/94 12:00)<n> <n><n> Reported : 5/19/00 11:15<n> <n><n> Posted : 6/6/00<n> <n><n> Location : New York, NY<n> <n><n> Shape : Egg no light and moved very slowly I was looking outside of my window at work and saw a light blue metallic blimp shaped thing, moving very slowly.

Overlooking Belfast Harbor<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and a friend were sitting at the city park when we heard something like a sonic boom, then a splash,then another boom.  My friend told me to stand behind him and look over the water.  When I did I saw a triangler shape swaying in the sky.  My friend told me to look at him and when I did I saw a white dot on his head.  I followed it to the triagle.  We got up and headed out of the park. We walked about 5 feet and stopped to look behind us.  It was gone.  Then there was a bright light above our head and we looked up.  The next think we know we had walked about 2oo feet and didn&#39;t know it.  That 200feet I have no idea what happened.<n>

AS I STOOD BEHIND THE CAMPER I LOOKED UP AND NOTICED A VERY  BRIGHT WHITE ROUND LIGHT IN THE SKY, ABOUT 2000 FEET  FROM THE GROUND. THE HEIGHT IS VERY HARD TO TELL BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS SO BRIGHT. THE DISTANCE AWAY FROM ME WAS MAYBE 1 QUARTER  MILE AWAY. I WAS AMAZED AND WATCHED IT SLOWLY MOVE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT SILENTLY.  IT REALLY GOT ME THINKING WHEN THE LIGHT JUST STOPPED AND HOVERED THERE IN FRONT OF ME. NOW I WAS REALLY THINKING WHAT THE HELL IS THAT LIGHT.  IT STOPPED FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS   THEN SLOW STARTED MOVING AGAIN IN THE SAME  DIRECTION AND SUDDENLY TURNED A BRIGHT ORANGE COLOUR AND DISAPEARED INTO NOWHERE WITHIN A SECOND.  AFTER A FEW MOMENT OF THINKING ABOUT IT I QUICKLY RAN INSIDE MY CAMPER AND TOLD MY WIFE WHAT I HAD SEEN AND LOCKED THE  DOOR. I WAS SO SCARED I COULDNT SLEEP ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY I ASKED OTHER CAMPERS IF THEY HAD SEEN THIS LIGHT BUT NOBODY HAD BEEN OUTSIDE AT THAT TIME. I HAD BEEN SCEPTICAL ABOUT UFO SIGHTINGS UNTIL I HAD SEEN THIS UNEXPLAINED LIGHTED ROUND OBJECT. I HAVE SINCE ENCOUNTERED 2 MORE SIGHTINGS IN WHICH ONE I HAVE 2 WITNESSES BUT THAT DOSENT MATTER. I BELIEVE THERE IS OTHER LIFE OUT THERE OTHER THAN THE HUMAN RACE AND THATS ALL THAT COUNTS. I AM TRUELY INTERESTED IN ALL SIGHTINGS AND BELIEVE MOST OF THEM TO BE TRUE SIGHTINGS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was heading northeast at about 3000 feet and approximately 300-350 miles mph.  It was first seen below the full moon for about 3 or 4 seconds.  The whole sighting lasted about 20 seconds.  These figures are of course estimated.  No sound could be heard above the outside plant noise (which was moderate).  The bottom of the craft was seen from the 5th floor at the plant.  It looked grayish in color.  The craft appeared to be a little longer than the fuselage of a Boeing 707.  Two large white blinking lights were on the end.  Both lights blinked at the same time.  Another small red light appeared in the middle.  Two small white lights were in front bottom of the braft.  These lights also blinked.  I was outside and looking toward the moon, which was high up in the Eastern sky.  It was cloudless at the time in that section of the sky.  The outline of the craft could clearly be seen because of the moonlight.  The craft was last seen just east of the local GE plant and still flying horizontal.  I later called Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base&#39;s control tower.  No other calls were received about this sighting.  My personal feeling is that this object was perhaps one of our secret projects or an alien craft.<n>

We were outside and watching the meteors when we noticed a red glow. We thought it was an airplane when it zoomed in at extreme speeds that no plane or helicopter could reproduce. It zoomed in, my brother and I were staring at it. It had red lights and something that looked to be windows, I dont know what exactly they were. The shape was a football kind of shape, maybe more oval, but It had to have been no further than 500 feet above us. It made no sound that I heard, and I couldnt see anything or anyone inside. We got scared and ran inside. Less than a minute later i ran back outside and there was nothing in the sky. I am 100% certain it was NOT a meteor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

We live in the country, so we take the back roads home. It was a unusally dark night. We were about a mile from home. As I went by the river, something came over just above the trees. It was going very slow. I stopped the truck and got out for a better look.I left my truck running and could hear no other sound. I was only 150 to 200 feet away. Curious I walked toward the craft. As I did three illuminated triangles came from it and started my direction. Scared for my safety, I ran to the truck and raced home. I was busy driving. My wife said one of the triangles passed through a telephone pole. When we got home we checked the time to be sure none was lost. Two of our children were with us. We don&#39;t talk about it much. The craft must of been dark in color as I could&#39;nt make out a shape. It had nine large lights . Six were gold, with three red in the middle. They were very bright abd I stared at them. That could be why I could&#39;nt see a shape. The newspapers the next day reported mysterious lights in the sky.The triangles had squares around them with a circle in the middle.<n>

In a car almost to our home, my mother stopped the car when she noticed some lights when looking out her driverside window (looking in a southern direction).  There were several lights of various color which looked as if the object was spinning very slowly, and one blinking light in the center on the top.  It could be seen not far above the tree line in the dark moving in a western direction VERY slowly with no change in elevation.  After debating if it was a helicopter or something we rolled down the window and there was complete silence.  If it had been a helicopter, it would have had to be within a 1/4 mile and would have obviously made considerable noise.  Soon it stopped and began to decend straight down even more slowly than it had been moving.  Suddenly it instantly accelerated almost too fast for our eyes to follow it increasing in elevation and heading in a south-eastern direction.  I thought I could still see it, quite some distance off now, but my mother was quite shaken by it and wanted to get my sister and I home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was a warm August night, (not sure though on the date, either 1993 or 94) and I was out on the front porch at home and I just happened to glance up and saw a very bright blinding light that was moving in my direction.  As I looked up it seemed to pick up speed and as the object moved overhead and to the side a bit, the light became an oval glowing white light and I noticed a smaller red glowing light on one side and a small green glowing light on the other.  The object whizzed by, arcing downward and disappearing from sight.  It made no sound at all.  It was very low, just above the tree-tops.  I saw no solid mass that the lights could have been attached to, as this sighting took place on a clear, dark, moonless night.  Total sighting lasted only about 2 seconds.  I was in absolute awe of what I had just seen.  I ran around back of the house to see if I could still see anything.  At that time I became overcome with fear.  I had read stories about men in black showing up at people&#39;s doorsteps after seeing a ufo and threatening them not to report such things.  With that in the back of my mind, I locked all the doors and told my parents about what I had just seen.  Nobody ever showed up at the door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although all aircraft are equipped with white lights and a green light on one wingtip and a red light on the other wingtip, this UFO&#39;s lights were too dim and too large.  They were glowing, not shining, like aircraft lights do.  And all the lights were clustered together, unlike an aircraft&#39;s.  This was completely silent, moved way too fast, and low, to be an aircraft of any kind.  It was moving North.  This also happened to be around the time that Napa was plagued by unmarked black helicopter traffic for months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a beautifull summer late day around 7:00 PM. There was a party outside my friends home who has a house right on the beach. By this time of day, the sun was setting in the West and could no longer be seen, but the light was still bright and coming in on a side angle from out of the West. We were on the East side of the house just a hundred yards from the ocean. My band was about to play that night. I had only drank less then a 1/2 of cup of beer and I do not take drugs. I just happened to glance up towards the top of the house when suddenly and without any sound at all, a triangle shaped object traveling at my estimate, faster then the speed of sound, flew directly over the house conming out of the West and proceded out over the ocean into the East. When it was about 5 miles offshore it divided into 2 seperate objects  and kept flying at the same speed and the same altitude, about 1,500 feet, untill both objects dissapered. The whole incident lasted less then 4 seconds. There were about 25 other people at the party. I looked around quickly to see if anyone else had witnessed what I just seen. I saw another man look at me with the same look I must have had on my face and he said, &#34; did you see that ? &#34;. I just nodded my head in stunned disbelief. No one else besides us had seemed to have seen it. It had happned so fast and silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFOR Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

There I am alone but not far from the others when I hear a loud, &#34;WHAT THE HELL IS THAT???!!&#34;  I went over to where it came from, we all gathered there in a line, and there they were in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the southern sky at about maybe a 50 degree angle were 2 large lights.  A big one following a smaller one.  They appeared as large lights in the sky.  To give an idea of how large they looked, the larger one was like 25 stars put together in size.  They both were bright with a orangish color, the smaller of the 2 had more of a uniform color, whiter.  The larger one had a whiteish center surrounded by an orangish hue.  They moved across the sky from west to east in a slight arc/downward angle. They didn&#39;t just move in a line though, the surged and stopped, surged and stopped.  It was very fluid though, the pauses they made were not jerky, the motion was smooth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued across the sky until the smaller one, the one in front appeared to stop moving while the other continued, but it didn&#39;t stop.  It started to get smaller, and fainter until it disappeared straight off into space.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the other did the same.  We all watched it as it got smaller, and smaller, until finally it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire time I was the only one who spoke, and I repeated the same thing over and over, &#34;What the @#%$ is that??!!, can anyone tell me what the @#%$ that is??!!&#34;  none of us had an answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now we&#39;re not rocket scientists, but we we&#39;re not morons either.  We tried to figure out what it could have been, plane, helicopter, weather balloon (lol) and no matter what rational explanation we came up with, there was always a reason why it couldn&#39;t have been that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Way in the distance there appeared what seemed to be a star in the horizon.  staring at the star I noticed it to appear closer and closer.  as it hovered above the pond I had seen that it was a disk shape almost like the &#34;classical&#34; shape of flying saucers seen on old black and white movies.  the top was a bright light and the bottom was black like a shadow.  I knew this could be no plane nor helicopter because there was complete silence and a airplane just cant stop and hover like that making no noise at all as close as i was (apx.40yards).  after ten minutes or so the ufo shot straight up faster it would seem then the fasted jet or missle in the world.  upon my conclusion of what i saw, i FIRMLY believe that this was a true U.F.O.  i&#39;ve never seen nothing like that ever in my lifetime and reflecting on this I still get the willys when I think about it or when I tell my story to my wonderful daughter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

WE ALL RAN AWAY.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Imagine the beach at night... How the water seems black. There was a thick fog rolling in and a few of the citys orange lights were barely visable through the fog. My cousin and I were camping at Dillion&#39;s beach with our family. When our parents had gone to sleep my cousin and I snuck out of our camp to meet up with these two girls we had meet eailer that day. I remember they were students of the Sacramento FFA. We meet up with these girls and decide a walk along the beach would be kinda fun. So we followed the trail through these large sand dunes that obscure the view of the beach. When we got out on the beach we began to flurt around and my cousin said he wanted to sit with girl he was talking with. I still wanted to walk the beach and so did the other girl (I don&#39;t know their names - only that the blonde had a good size scar on her left cheek) So we began to walk the beach and we were talking about somthing when she suddenly grabbed my arm and in a husshed tone said &#34;What is that?&#34; Ilooked up to where she was pointing. &#34;I saw something move over there.&#34; I looked and saw nothing. Just fog, ocean and a few specks from the street lights about a mile and a half away. I told her she was seeing things and we continued to walk, but this time she grabbed my arm violently - nearly making me fall over. &#34;LOOK!&#34; I looked up to see a green aura slowly emerge from behind the dunes and it slowly floated towards the shore. It casted a lime green color but unlike an electric lightbulb beam, the light emmiting from this thing was spread out evenly, there seemed that there was no source, no origin to the unearthly green glow. I looked over at the girl and said &#34;Let&#39;s go get my cousin&#34;. She agreed hastily as we ran down the beach to find him. He was were we left him with the other girl and I ran up to him from out of the darkness and in a tone I have never spoken before said &#34;GET UP AND COME WITH ME NOW!&#34; and for some reason he did not even ask why as I lead the other three back up the shore line. All the while I was thi! nking how stupid we would sound once we got there and nothing was to be seen. Much to my suprise the green aura was there! It was hovering silently above the wet part of the sand. All four of us stood in shaock. I remember someone asking what it was but no one answered because the aura began to move. And it was moving towards us! The two girls immediatly turned tail and fled as my cousin grabrd my shoulder and told me to run. I resisted and he let go and began to run as I looked back the aura was moving much faster than a seconed before and it was coming at me... I felt afraid for my life...I have never been afraid like that ever. I stood there just a moment longer to get a good look at it then I too ran away as fast as I could and I never looked back. When we got back the girls went to their camp and my cousin and I sat around the embers of our campfire. We began to talk about what we had seen when a horrible scream filled the night air. It was a girl&#39;s scream and it was coming from the girl&#39;s camp. The girl that my cousin was talking with on the beach begaing to scream out at the top of her lungs &#34;WHAT was IT? WHAT was it? WHAT was it?&#34; Untill the members of her camp came out to calm her down. She was having a breakdown mentally and it really set in my mind that what we saw out there is nothing we are ever taught about in school.<n>

It was almost midnight.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw something coming diagonally over us from behind.  I alerted ((Name deleted)), and we both got a good long look.  It was approximately the shape of a minivan, and about twice as big.  It was dark grey or black in color, and we approximated that it was between 40 and 60 feet above us, and traveling away from between 30 and 60 miles per hour.  It was virtually silent, except for a slight hum, possibly displaced air. It had no markings that we could see.  The most amazing thing was how it moved, completely steady.  It never sped up, slowed down or wavered in it&#39;s course, it was as if it was on a track.  It was so unusual seeing something as large as it was traveling so smoothly, quietly, and slowly in the air without wings.  It was truly defying gravity. It passed over our heads, over the golf course, and then into the desert heading east. Shawn and I have always been bothered by the fact that the description of our sighting does not match any others that we have heard or read. Why was it moving so slow, why did it not have any lights, why was it not shaped like most &#34;UFO&#39;s&#34; we hear about. I wish I knew!!!<n>

The next thing we knew a huge ship was coming slowly right above us pretty slowly. we freaked out bad and tried to get off the big limestone hill we were on. As we tried to get out from being directly underneath this ship I noticed 2 pod like ships cruising at the treetop level about a few hundred yds away, slowly following the big ship or checking out the quarry. 2 friends ran to the car which was parked 200yds away. my friend and I paused to watch the big ship float over the lake once again, as the big ship started coming at us again, we had had enough fun at this point and ranfor the car. After we got on to the highway my 2 friends in the backseat said that it is coming after us, I drove probably 70-80 mph and noticed a increasingly bright fill my mirrors then disappear! needless to say I didnt sleep for days. we never have reported it till this day.<n>

A lot of time has passed, but it was one of those moments that get seared into one&#39;s mind forever.  I would like to give some background information and describe my experience as best as I can recall it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a summer evening in late August, my friend, mother and I were laying outside in our yard on our trampoline.  It may have been around 11 to midnight as it was most definitely dark, and the sun would not have set until 9:15pm that time of year.  We were idly stargazing and chatting as we often did.  We lived near rural Ida, Michigan, (an agricultural community in southeast Michigan, about an hour south of Detroit, near the Ohio border) and did not have a lot of light pollution so stargazing was a normal summer evening past time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would often track commercial airlines and  watch  the horizons because where we lived is defined by very flat, treeless farmland and uninterrupted views could be see in any direction.  Plane spotting was easy as we seemed to live under the flight path of the Detroit Metro Airport, and would very often view low flying commercial aircraft circling over our house.  So I am very familiar with viewing planes at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On that evening, however, I recall quietly talking, and not really paying attention to anything particular in the sky.  However, I remember all at once immediately realizing that I could not see the stars up above me.  It was a clear night.  I recall sitting up in the trampoline, looking up and seeing a mass in the air above our yard that was large enough to seem to sit over the entire property as it passed, which was around ¾ of an acre.  I could tell it was a triangular mass only by lights on three points.  I generally recall that they were not too bright, yet also illuminated the ground around us below.  It was low, seemingly floating just barely over the top of our barn and farmhouse, however, since I did regularly experience those low flying planes that were waiting to land, I knew it only seemed to be that low.  What was most eerie about the encounter that the flying mass seemed to make little or no noise.  It glided almost over like a helium float, but in a controlled and steady fashion.  I recall there being something like a low pulse hum, but I don&#39;t remember it being loud, like if I had been in the house or if there was traffic noise etc, I may not have noticed it at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mass headed in a southern direction.  However, I did not watch it to see where it went.  To be honest, my friend and I were scared out of our minds and as soon as it directly overhead us, I remember fleeing to our house in sheer terror, dragging my mother along, who was laying tummy down and didn&#39;t notice it right away (which tells you how quiet it was).  I was very freaked out, as the 90&#39;s was hooked on X-Files and crop signs, but I don&#39;t ever remember feeling it was alien.  It&#39;s hard to explain, but even though I couldn&#39;t explain it, and I feared it, I felt it was military or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I can&#39;t quite remember is, is if there was a center light.  I feel like I remember there being a cooler light in the center of the mass, but I am not entirely sure as I only acutely remember the three lights making the triangular shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never again saw an object like that fly in the skies where we lived.  Although, I did note lights that would seem like satellites in the sky, (bright, no twinkle) but would stop and start movement in the sky in unpredictable patterns.  And when they move, I would get light interference in radio signals.  (I would often wear headphones and listen to fm radio on my Walkman if I was stargazing alone).  I noted these most often in western skies and off and on over several years.  I don&#39;t know if this was related.<n>

It has always stayed in my mind as I had never seen anything like it.  I never knew to whom or if I should report it to anyone as I thought that people might think that I’m crazy.  Anyway, I would like to share this story now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me, my husband and two young children, ages 4 and 10 at the time were on our way to Disneyland in Anaheim, California.  To avoid the evening traffic, we had left our home in San Jose, California at about 7:30 pm in hopes of checking into our hotel at least by midnight.  My husband and I had decided that I would drive as I had been home resting during the day and he had worked.   We decided that he would sleep during the trip and I would awaken him if I would get tired of driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10:45pm and we were at least sixty miles away from Bakersfield and my husband and younger child were asleep in the back seat.  My older child was asleep in the passenger seat.  I was listening to music.  I could see in the distant the dark gray of the sky with the shadows of the hills beyond.  I could also see what I thought were city lights in the distance.  All of a sudden a very bright light above the hills caught my attention as it seemed that it was descending in a very vertical manner and quite rapidly.  My first thought was, &#34;Oh my God, could that be a plane that is falling?&#34;   No sooner had I thought that, when it seemed that it was coming right towards our car and very quickly.  I got scared and began to speed up.  I looked into my rear view mirror to see if other cars were close by, but it seemed that the car behind me was still a ways back.  “The object” seemed to have come right next to us to what seemed about 25 to 30 feet away in the open space next to us.  It zoomed by very low, almost parallel to my vehicle.  It went past us and I remember looking through my side mirror only to see it coming back at a slower rate.  It was hovering and spinning slowly.  It then came exactly parallel to my car as I drove at about 70 MPH.  It just hovered and spun next to me for what seemed like a minute or two.  My youngest son awoke at that moment and I asked him, “JJ, what is that thing?”  I wanted to make sure my mind was not playing tricks on me.  He replied in his four year old voice, “A spaceship!”  Just then it made a final quick and rapid spin and disappeared back into the distance in the direction it had come from.  I was speechless and still trying to wrap my head around what I had just experienced.  I quickly woke my husband to tell him what had just happened and he said that it was probably a helicopter or some military object test being conducted.  I then replied, “A triangular helicopter that spun with white lights around it and made absolutely no noise!”  Furthermore, it was not onl! y triang ular, but the triangle did not have straight lines, it seemed to have inwards curves with many lights all along the curves.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know if it indeed an UFO, but to me it surely was unidentifiable.  I had never seen or have ever seen anything like it.<n>

We had arrived there around 5:30 p.m. or 6 p.m., and the only reason the security guard at the gate let us in was because my friend knew somebody. There were private homes surrounding the lake, but there were no homes in the area where we were fishing, which we did for hours during the visit without catching anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At around 10 p.m., I turned around to get a cigarette out of my tackle box when I noticed three large bright lights hovering behind some trees. Behind the pond was an open field of high grass a few hundred yards in diameter, and along the perimeter of the field was dense forest. The object I saw was off to the left. I said to my buddy, &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;   Astonished, he said, &#34;I don’t know.&#34;  The object moved out from behind the trees and started to slowly make its way toward our position. It was only two or three stories above the ground, and I had a great fear it was about to land in the open field. My friend pointed his flashlight at the object when it was just about over our heads. I wanted to get in his truck and flee the scene. The object, which emitted no noise whatsoever, then started to move in another direction away from us toward the forest until it finally disappeared over some trees. The object’s lights faced us during the entire sighting, making it impossible to determine the craft’s shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I threw our fishing gear into the back of his truck and sped away to the entrance of the private lake, which happened to be in the direction the object flew. We were traveling along a dirt road when we had to stop and wait for a slew of deer to cross. The animals were running from the area where the object had flown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regarding the object, we were unable to make out its shape because the three lights facing us were extremely bright. Each light was three times as large as an automobile headlight, and they were brighter than high beams. The object must have been fairly large, however, because there was some decent space between each light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object could not have been a plane, jet or helicopter because of the way it moved and because it made no sound. Furthermore, I’ve never seen any flying craft that could move so close to trees like this one did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Other aircraft were visible from our position, but they were merely planes taking off and landing at a nearby airport, which was pretty far away from the lake. The object we saw basically was right in our faces and, again, couldn&#39;t have been a conventional aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The penthouse is maybe 15 stories up.  The object was at an altitude of approximately 170 feet.  It approached from the Northwest horizon heading Southeast.  It was in my sight for approximately two seconds.  This timeframe includes the approach.  It appeared to be a cluster of maybe four to five spherical quartz halogen type lights.  It was about the size of a small automobile.  There was no sound.  It was close enough to me and it went so fast that I should have felt a wind wake as it went by but I felt nothing.  I ran to the other side of the penthouse in hopes of seeing it disappear over the Southeast horizon but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is all that I saw.

It was dusk, and the sky was beginning to darken.  I looked up and saw a disk, apparently black, with a red light in the center.  There was no distortion at all; this was a flying disk-shaped object.  It simply passed overhead, made no sound, and I never saw it again.<n>

The craft gave off a loud, deep, oscillating, electro-acoustic, bass, humming sound that came from the sky.  The bass from the craft oscillated slowly and became louder and deeper and began to shake me and the ground.  The craft came very close during the encounter and appeared to be on the ground in front of me and another approximately 40yrds away.  I do not know if it was the same craft in the sky or something different that approached the two of us.  I could go further into what happened next, but I will reserve the right not to continue.   I will say this, if I could of saw what approached the two of us I probably would not have stuck around.  I am glad I did because I know that there is more out there than meets the eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

They were looking south toward Pine Ridge, when they noticed a revolving set of lights in the sky.  There were five different colors in this order:  orange, yellow, blue, green, and red, each slowly revolving one at a time around a large invisible circular area.  The circlular area was &#34;like a plate laying down&#34; in a horizontal attitude.  The phenomenon appeared to be inside the clouds and was very large.  Finally they &#34;gave up&#34; and went back in to play cards, and later went back out to find that it was still there.  This continued for hours, no sound was heard, and the revolving phenomenon just sat there the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/10/94 22:40|Fort Irwin|CA|Unknown|3-5 minutes|Yellow-Orange object in sky north of Baker California,  August 1994.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42237.html|37|ndxe199408| Yellow-Orange object in sky north of Baker California,  August 1994.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at NTC in Fort Irwin with the 2AD and 1st Calvary Div. I was a dismount in the Army 3-41st at the time and was 20 years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had a fairly large perimeter we were guarding. There wasn&#39;t anything to do, but look at the stars. I was amazed at how many stars could be seen in the sky in the desert. I was watching airplanes, satelites in orbit and just star gazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had been watching the sky for probably close to an hour before seeing this yellow-orange light moving across the sky at a consistant speed, not fast or anything that caught my eye.  I continued stargazing and watching other objects in the sky.  I was kind of tracking the objects seeing where they were going and what they were doing.  I was keeping track of a satelite an airplane and this other object which I thought was also an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was looking at these three items when I couldn&#39;t find the yellow-orange light. It didn&#39;t flash like the other airplane I was watching and wondered where it had gone.  I thought I saw it in the sky but it was not moving.  The position I was facing was toward Baker California. The object was to the left of Baker, I have no idea of the distance. The desert is very deceiving about distance but Baker was atleast 20 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I focused my attention on the object and was about to dismiss it as the plane I had been watching when it moved. It made a series of movements and returned to the position I first saw it sitting stationary in. The first movement was side to side it moved left, then right past center, then left past center, then right past center, then returned to center. It then moved up and down starting in the position I first saw it in stationary.  It moved up, then down past center, then up past center, then down past center, then back to center. It then did what I would call a four leaf clover move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was strange about it, or what stuck in my head is it never took the same path during this move and returned to center. Between each of these moves it would return to center and pause for about a second to a second and a half.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I am running toward another soldier in my squad that has a set of binoculars I wanted a better look at the object and also for someone else to see it besides me. The event was over before I made it to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next two moves is what I couldn&#39;t believe. The object paused a little longer after the clover leaf move, maybe two seconds, then moved away from the ground in an arc towards the sky. The object appeared to be in the place I first saw it stationary and also where I would describe the edge of space at the same time. The yellowish-orange light was about 3 inches long and the same width and intensity as the object. The light caught up to the object in a fraction of a second. It then paused again for about 2 seconds and went out into space as far as I could see at a slight angle away from me. The light appeared to be wherever it was going and where it was at the same time again and then the light disappeared after it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was so incredible that I believed I was seeing things. I started changing my mind when I saw seven helicopters come from behind and to the right of me, go the the area I saw the object, circle the area, then return where I saw them come from. I also felt relieved the next day when I ran into a guy from the first Calvary Div. that said he was lying on his tank and described the same thing I saw.<n>

Back in the mid early 1990’s while I was driving to my 2nd shift job at the time at approximately 9:45pm I saw something that I cannot explain.  I saw a large perfectly round red ball in the air over a field.  The best way I could describe it would be a fire ball.  At first it looked as if it was falling to the earth but was too slow of a descent to be something falling.  The object stopped falling hovered and moved to the right and then started to ascend back into the sky again.  There probably is some logical explanation as to what I was seeing but for the life of me I can’t think what that explanation would be.  I would love for someone with UFO experience to contact me and give me a logical explanation of what I was seeing.<n>

Sylvan was so crouded that we chose to stay up the road at Gull Lake.  There was myself, my girlfriend at the time and two other couples in our party.  It was a beautiful day, I was laying on the beach with my head on my girlfriends lap.  She was sitting up so her shadow was covering my face which allowed me to remove my sunglasses and marvel at the blue, cloudless sky without having to squint my eyes.  I noticed a line of smoke form, not unlike the exhaust of a jet plane but much lower as I could see the billows forming at the front and being left behind as the trail continued to grow.  It took me only one second to realize that there was no plane in front to cause this and as my stomach tightened to sit up, out of the front shot a black triangle spinning clockwise.  It spun two-thirds of the way around and stopped dead.  By the time I could say &#34;what the fu-&#34; , it took off in level flight across the sky and disapeared in the distance, not over the horizon, just into the distance.  It moved as fast as a thought.  No sound, no exhaust.  As I finished my sentance &#34;-ck is that?!!&#34;  my girlfriend looked up and said all she saw was a wisp of smoke disapate.  I looked around to see if any one else was looking, but they were looking at me because of my outburst.  I was so shocked by what I KNOW I SAW, I had to get up and walk back to the campsite.  Aproximately two months later, my girlfriend handed me a newspaper article I believe was from the Edmonton Journal about variuos UFO sightings.  half way through the article was the sentance &#34;and still unexplained are reports of dark triangles seen flying over southern Alberta.&#34; I still have it somewhere, so I know somebody else saw it.  I have since, through personal experience, been able to estimate the height at between six and eight thousand feet.  This triangle did not come from the outer atmosphere, it entered this &#34;space?&#34; or &#34;dimention?&#34;! right before my eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We headed up to Grizzy Mountain where I&#39;ve previously hunted since a teenager.  It was late when we got there and I set up our tent and started a fire.  While we sat there enjoying the great outdoors I began to feel very uncomfortable.  That feeling you get as if someone&#39;s watching you or your not alone.  I told my wife how I felt and she shrugged it off saying I&#39;m probably just tired.  I agreed and went and sat in the front seat of our car to look for a something I could use as a weapon so I could make myself feel as comfortable as she was feeling.  While sitting in the front seat I noticed a light to the left of a tree top.  I thought it was just a star but then the light moved to the right of the tree top and I began to rationalize it as the rotation of the earth or something or wind blowing the tree tops, yet I felt no breeze and none of the tree tops seemed to be swaying.  I watched the light for awhile as it kept moving from one side of the tree top to the other, until I finally heard my wife call my name and ask what I was doing.  I told her to come sit in the car next to me and watch what I thought I was seeing.  She was quite annoyed by it and felt like I was trying to play a prank or something which she didnt find funny at all because she was pregnant and wasnt in the mood for it.  When she sat in the car I asked her to watch the star/ light and tell me what she thought of it.  After a few minutes she got real close to me and said she wasnt feeling very comfortable up here in the mountains anymore.  She told me she things the light keeps moving from left to right of the tree top and then back again.  That settled it for me.  I knew I wasnt just seeing things then.  Then I felt a boldness and got out of the car and started yelling up at the light saying come on down we&#39;re friendly and we mean you no harm.  I want to see what you look like ! and stuff like that.  Truely I was completely scared but by doing this it kept my nerves steady.  Then the wind began to blow real bad and I thought I sensed a movement on the ground it the surrounding trees but I couldnt tell.  The light of the fire was making it too hard to see the surroundings.  I put the fire out real quick and waited a bit so my eyes could adjust to the dark so I could try and see if I noticed any movement.  A few moments later my wife freaked out saying she felt weird and was scared for her unborn baby and ranted about other things I dont remember now.  Then I heard alot of movement in the trees about 30 yards away and it freaked me out.  I jumped in the car with her and told her screw this we&#39;re getting out of dodge. I tried to start the car and the freaken car wouldnt start.  We were both really stressin out then.  We were parked facing up hill where are camp was and my car was a stick shift, so I put it in neutral and let it roll back to pop the clutch.  It worked and the car fired up and we took off down the way we came, sky ranch road.  On our way up the road was really clear, but as we sped off back down the mountain trees started falling over next to us and branches were falling off of trees and I couldnt make any sense of where I was at.  I knew those roads like the back of my hand and due to panic or who knows what else, I felt a bit lost.  Then my wife said stop the car, we just passed that same spot awhile ago and I think we just went in a big circle.  I stopped the car and we got out of the car and we started calming each other down trying to reason all this out.  Then I became stressed out again because I knew that there was no way we could have went in a circle.  There was only one way back down that mountain , sure there were plenty of off roads to go elsewhere, but none of those roads would have took us in a circle based on where we stopped.  I couldnt make sense of any of it.  For some reason we both looked up about the same time and we both saw a blue glowing ligh! t with an ovalish/ coccoon shaped object spinning within it.  I was in awe.  It was so pretty yet so weird looking.  My wife jumped back in the car and said drive damn it.  I jumped back in the car and told her we arent going any further.  My instincts told me that when your panicing its best to just stay put and calm down regardless of the situation.  Think things out.  I checked by watch and I knew it was almost morning time and we could just wait it out.  Whatever it was it was sure to leave when the sun came up.  While waiting we both faded in and out of sleep until  I noticed things were getting alot lighter.  Thank God the sun was coming up.  When the sun came up we just sat there in the car holding each other.  I asked her if we just both had the craziest dream or what?  She said theres no way we could have had the same crazy dream and she wanted to leave.  My stubborness wouldnt let me just leave though.  I wanted to go back to camp and get my tent and belongings.  She said forget them, we can get more, but I wanted my stuff and my curiousity was killing me.  I wanted to troll around the camp in the woods and see if I found anything strange.  We got back to camp and packed things up and walked around a bit and noticed a large burnt area up aways from were we camped.  We felt real creepy again and both agreed to leave.  We told my Mom about it and my Step Dad when we got back.  My Mom was way curious because she knew I never was a story teller and never made things up.  My step Dad was probably thinking just the opposite after hearing what we just them.  We never told anyone else though.  Thought people would laugh or make fun of us.  A few months later though my Mom talked her husband into taking them up to the same spot to camp.  He knew exactly where it was at.  Hes been hunting up there for years.  The next day we went by there home and they told us they went up there to camp, but they didnt stay.  They both told us that they felt really uncomfortable at that camp spot and felt like they were ! being watched or something.  They came off the mountain the same night and came home.  I havent been back to that sight yet and dont plan on ever going there again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I found this web site right now I couldnt resist telling our story.  It feels real good to be able to talk about it again.   Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

It was a clear starry sky.  It seem really high up in the sky, if one was to hold up a quarter an arms length might have been even smaller say a nickel.  It was not round but rather an equilateral triangle.  There was a maroon light (the size of an average star) on each corner and one in between the corners (on two sides).   I feel like one side didn’t have a red light in the middle but there could have been.  The brightness of the maroon lights didn’t stand out too much from the stars probably same intensity only maroon colored. Its location was fixed in one spot (for 15 min).  The only movement it made was the rotation.  It was rotating clockwise very slowly at a constant speed, maybe one revolution per minute.  There was no sound coming from it.  We looked at it for about 10-15 minutes and then went inside to tell the adults but no one paid any attention to us.  We didn’t! go back outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A friend and myself were walking to her house around 10.pm from the house of another friend.  We turned down a side street and thought we saw a plane flying very low we moved into the middle of the street to get a better look.  we thought this was a plane because we saw lights (lights like that were pretty visible then because alot of the sidestreets had only 2 or so streetlights on them so there was alot of dark areas).  we stopped walking, looked at each other and remarked to each other about how low that plane was flying, and how something must be wrong for them to be so low.  we spoke for what had to be less than a minute or two. as we looked back up the lights were almost directly above us and hovering.  it was oval shaped, black i think, with 3 lights in a semicircular shape, there were 2 sets and 2 rows of these lights facing each other.  they were so bright.  they were just so bright it seemed unreal.  It must have been about the size of a large oval pool.  i think that is what shocked us the most.  that what we thought was a plane was so small and so quietand that while it was  hovering it was sort of dipping from side to side kind of like a small boat on choppy water, not like it was going to flip over or anything i don&#39;t think.  just like choppy water movement.  my friend and i looked at each other again for what seemed like an hour,  and ran in different directions.  we finally caught up with each other, and made it to her house. no one believed us.  even now, today no one believes me.  i don&#39;t speak to that particular girl very much anymore we both went different ways in life.  but any time i see her we both end up talking about it.  we know what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the two witnesses might have observed the object allegedly seen by dozens of witnesses from the Staten Island Ferry at 22:08 hrs. on Friday, September 15, 1995.

It was close to a new moon so the sky was dark and we had a clear view of the evening sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were facing in the direction of  Cathedral Rock which would have been northwest of our home.  I first noticed what seemed to be a very bright star just to the west of Cathedral Rock and pointed it out to my husband.  Within minutes after we noticed  a white laser type beam came in from the east and hit this object which I thought was a star.  We could see the object flare at first and then about 20 seconds later it exploded causing a firework type of effect - sparks floating down.  There was no sound and we just sat there shocked at what we had just seen.  About an hour later we received a phone call from friends in West Sedona telling us that there was a fire going in Secret Canyon (west of 89-A), but they didn’t know much about it. We told them of what we had seen just a hour before and we all wondered if it might be connected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By morning the fire in Secret Canyon was quite bad, but because it is a very remote canyon the Forest Service decided to just watch the fire rather then try to fight it with water planes.  We went into town to a local coffee house and meet a few other people talking about the fire and the night before. One couple stated that about an hour before the fire was reported they saw a small flaming object fall into Secret Canyon and they thought that was the cause of the fire. That would have been right about the time that we witnessed the explosion in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The people of Sedona watched this fire burn for ten days, many sitting for hours at night on Air Port Mesa looking out over Secret Canyon.  When the fire finally began to reach the area of resorts in Oak Creek Canyon the Forest Service decided to fight the fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In itself this story doesn’t sound like much in the way of a UFO report, but at that time in Sedona many locals were aware of something strange in Secret Canyon, and another area, because many hikers into that area had been turned away by military type men in black uniforms with M-16s to back them up. There had even been two off duty police officers hiking there  that had been turned back and told to not return.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the fire was put out the whole canyon area was closed off for about 3 months and many trucks were seen going into that area. Many of the locals at that time felt that there might have been some type of aerial fight between two “UFOs” and the one shot down fell into Secret Canyon.  Many of the locals were talking about it and many tourist over heard and asked questions - and then a few days later some of the locals working in the shops had visits by men dressed as tourist in dark sunglasses. I was one of those locals, a man entering the shop and came “nose to nose’ with me and said, “I hear that you know a lot about UFOs, tell me about them”.  I knew exactly what that was all about and said nothing and the man left. There were enough locals afraid after that to just remain quiet.  One local rancher had already had much trouble from different government agencies because of UFO reports he had made and so it put the locals on pins and needles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a LOT that has, and still does, go on in this area revolving around UFOs and alien life forms - people just don’t talk openly about it anymore<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were watching a metorite shower since this is one of the best times to view one all year long, (being usually the first week in August of every year).  Anyway, we live near the U.S. Army&#39;s traing base of Ft. Rucker and that night and many other nights had witnessed numerous rotary wing and fixed winged crafts.  We had seen what we though that night to even be a satellite or two ,--  but anyway back to the story we knew what we were looking at and the Northeast corner of the sky is where our attention was that particular night. My Son , 12 years old at the time was the first to see &#34;it&#34;, he said &#34;look at that - pointed to almost the same place of the meteor shower, and what we saw was a perfectly round dark/black object with maybe some sort of illumnination shing up above the craft.  It was moving basically North to South and we witnessed it for maybe five seconds.  The size of the object was approximately the size of a silver dollar or say maybe if you make the O.K. size with you your hand the circle your create is close to the size. We noticed no noise and after it left our field of view we all felt like we had witnessed something very unusual.  My 13 year old Daughter was witness to this also. What makes this very unusual, if that is the correct word, is that I was talking to a coworker - was was also out looking at the metorite showers that week and I was telling him about what we saw on Tuesday night of that week and he said his Son had said to him on Thursday Night of that week &#34;Dad you will not believe what I just saw ? It looked like a Dark Circle going East to West&#34;.  Well when my friend told me that it solidified my thougts that we had indeed seen something very unusual that could not be ex explained and would definitely fall into the catagory  of a U.F.O. . All I ask is -- I sincerely want to find out if anyone has any idea of what we witnessed .???  Please notify me ??? I have tried to contact MUFON and report this to them and all the sent me was a membership form -- get real -- no wonder people do not report these sort of things.

I sped home to tell my family so we could go and investigate the matter.  My wife called 911, but they claimed they were something to do with the mine.  I rounded up the kids and we drove out to meet them.  Two of my stubborn daughters would not accept the fact, so me, my wife, and our believing kids began driving over toward the huge lights off in the distance.  By the time we got to the mine, they had disappeared<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness describes self as &#34;student.&#34;  PD))<n>

The reason why he does not want to report it is because he is skeptical of aerial phenomenon but I thought it was woth reporting it if he wasn&#39;t going to. My friend was at a men&#39;s retreat in a upper Wisconsin area, very far north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said him and about two others were enjoying the summer evening when they saw a light far away up in the night sky.  He said when he first noticed it he figured it was a satellite.  But then he realized it was moving faster than a satellite and moved at sharp and random horizontal, vertical and angled paths. &#34;Kind of zig-zaggy&#34; is the term I think he used. I don&#39;t recall if he said the lights were colored or not.  He just noticed the unusual movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> (P.S. Regarding the report a UFO over at O&#39;Hare International in Chicago on Nov. 7, 2006. I&#39;ve known several people who work at the airport on the ramps, maintence, etc, and I find them to be people who would not make something up as controversial as a UFO sighting in restricted airspace, especially n this era of heightened airport security and the Patriot Act, it impresses even more.  My feeling is that these people must have seen something significant or they wouldn&#39;t have stuck their necks out as they did to report it.)<n>

One does not report such things unless he is willing to be scrutinized.  I was not so willing.  I am grateful that I can share this anonymously and be taken seriously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was mid summer in Beloit, Wisconsin.  Some friends and I were sitting around a bon fire that night talking and laughing.  I enjoy looking up at the stars, wondering what else is out there and who.  As I was gazing into the night sky something, a shape, caught my attention.  There were no lights or sound.  There was only that large triangular shape obscuring the starlight as it glided stealthily across the sky.  If you were to hold your hand up, it would have been approximately half the size.  I watched it move silently for about 45 seconds.  It didn’t move fast, but it maintained a constant speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind raced for a logical explanation, but I could find none.  I thought perhaps it was a stealth fighter plane.  I then deduced that it would have moved faster and made some sort of sound as it passed by.  Not to mention, it would have had lights being over U.S. soil.  I also thought about telling my friends, but I didn’t feel comfortable with being called crazy or told I was just seeing things.  That was the only time I saw an object as such, yet I still stare up at the sky hoping that I might catch a glimpse of it one more time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it’s not much, but it is what I saw that night.  This is the first I’ve even mentioned it.  Please, do not take this as a hoax.  I know what I saw and I know we are not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,  Sky watcher in WI<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I saw 2 orange flashing lights on the Eastern horizon.  I grabbed him by the shoulder and without saying a word I pointed to sky.  These lights flashed and then made a jump towards the South.  They moved parallel to each other and after making an inital jump they appeared to jump back to the spot they had jump from before.  Each jump forward and backward increased their speed until they were moving faster than anything I&#39;ve ever seen.  I don&#39;t think this was an asteroid because it was moving slowly at first and then accelerated.  Plus there were 2 bright pulsing lights that moved parallel from North to South.  After the lights disappeared I asked him what he saw and he smiled and said you know what I saw.  My friend called in the report to some one over the phone, but no one else saw what we saw.  Most people were probably looking West at the sunset.  We see figter jets all the time in san diego, but this was no jet and this was no rocket either.  We were too far away to see the shape of the craft.  I would estimate we were 15 to 20 miles away.  These lights covered and an amazing amount of distance and were still excellerating when I lost sight of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We saw several faint falling stars.  Then we saw a bright light flash twice in the Northwest sky, the next second it flashed twice lower, and then it flashed twice in between the first two areas.  That was it.  We were saying, &#34;what the heck was that???&#34;  We lived out in the country and I had grown up in the house and knew very well that there are no towers around that would have lights on it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if it was 3 objects, or just one moving around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We, of course, kept watching the sky, but saw nothing else like it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
