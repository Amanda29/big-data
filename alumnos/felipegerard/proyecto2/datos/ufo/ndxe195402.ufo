I saw the UFO high above on the far side of lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In an attempt to be rational I asked the young lady if she saw anything in the sky.  She said, &#34;Yes&#34;.  I then asked her NOT to tell me anything she was observing, so we would NOT INFLUENCE each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed one large saucer and soon two more small ones.  The smaller UFOs were maneuvering in and out toward the big UFO as if they were in a refueling process.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon one of the small UFOs went over the horizon and the other went straight up and disappeared.  The large UFO then went through a series of amazing maneuvers from hovering to amazing speeds back and forth and up and down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the UFO started appearing larger and larger until about the size of a football field and directly over my car!!

2/1/54 02:00|Fairbanks|AK|Unknown|19 MIN.|RADAR INTERCEPT OF UFO BY USAF PILOT IN ALASKA 1954.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67341.html|2|ndxe195402| RADAR INTERCEPT OF UFO BY USAF PILOT IN ALASKA 1954.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WAS A PILOT ATTACHED TO THE 449TH FIGHTER INTERCEPTOR SQUADRON ALL WEATHER AT LADD AIR FORCE BASE OUTSIDE OF FAIRBANKS ALASKA IN FEBRUARY 1954. WE WERE FLYING F-94A&#39;S AND F94B&#39;S. OUR GROUND RADAR CONTROL STATION WAS CODE NAMED CRANE CONTROL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I HAD BEEN SCRAMBLED OFF ABOUT TWO AM WITH MY BACKSEAT RADAR ORSERVER. WE HAD MADE OUR INTERCEPT AND WERE RELEASED BY CRANE CONTROL. AS WAS THE CUSTOM, WE WERE FLYING ABOUT BURNING UP FUEL AS IT WAS UNWISE TO LAND WITH MUCH FUEL LEFT IN THE WING TIP TANKS. WE WERE ABOUT 50 MILES NORTHWEST OF LADD WHEN WE WERE RECONTACTED BY CRANE CONTROL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THEY SAID THAT THE ANCHORAGE RADAR CONTROL STATION, WHOSE NAME I HAVE FORGOTTEN, HAD CONTACTED THEM AND THAT THERE WAS AN OBJECT FLYING NORTH AT ABOUT 1100 TO 1200 KNOTS PER HOUR. THEY HANDED OFF THE CONTACT TO CRANE CONTROL. NOTE, THIS WAS 1954. NOTHING FLEW THAT FAST IN 1954. BY CHANCE WE WERE IN THE FLIGHT PATH OF THE OBJECT. THIS WAS FEBRUARY AND AT THAT LATITUDE IT WAS BITTER COLD AND VERY BLACK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> CRANE CONTROL GAVE ME A VECTOR FOR AN INTERCEPT. MY RADAR OPERATOR SOON PICKED UP THE OBJECT AND WE HAD A HEADON INTERCEPT OR VERY CLOSE. NOT THE BEST SITUATION, BUT I PLOWED RIGHT AHEAD AND KEPT THE BOGEY DEAD CENTER. IT TOOK ONLY ABOUT 30 SECONDS FOR THE INTERCEPT SUCH AS IT WAS. I WAS SURE I WAS DEAD. NOTHING HAPPENED. NO VISUAL, NO TURBULENCE, NO STATIC OR ANY THING. I DID ABOUT A THREE G 180 AND MY RADAR OBSERVER PICKED IT UP AGAIN AND THEN IT WAS GONE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ANCHORAGE IS ABOUT 250 NAUTICAL MILES SOUTH OF FAIRBANKS. WE WERE ABOUT 50 MILES NORTH SO THE ENTIRE EVENT MAY HAVE TAKEN ABOUT 20 TO 30 MINUTES.<n> <n><n> <n><n> THIS IS NO GREAT STORY BUT I AM 80 YEARS OLD AND DON&#39;T WANT IT TO DIE WITH ME. THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT THE OBJECT WAS PICKED UP BY THREE DIFFERENT RADARS. IT HAD MASS AND SIZE ENOUGH TO RETURN A PRETTY GOOD RADAR RETURN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I HOPE THS ADDS SOMETHING TO YOUR FILES.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
