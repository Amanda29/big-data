She was driving in her car with her husband (my grandfather, a pilot and member of the barnstormers group &#34;The Victory Flyers&#34;, now deceased).<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both saw a large glowing gold saucer that followed them for several miles in broad daylight before speeding away at a rate of speed never heard of or seen by either of them before.

It was passed on to the resurrected &#34;Project Blue Book&#34; based in Arkansas at the time but there was never any follow-up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This may be the earliest sighting in the USA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted)) is still very sharp and able to give details of the sighting if anyone is interested in taking a report.
