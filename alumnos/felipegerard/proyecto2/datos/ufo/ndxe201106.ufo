6/30/11 23:30|Modena|NY|Light|up to 5 minutes|Lights over the Shawangunk Mountain Range.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90001.html|2|ndxe201106| Lights over the Shawangunk Mountain Range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our deck faces the Shawangunk Mountain range in NY.  In the summer months we spend a lot of time outside at night and witness strange lights in the sky.  One night in 2011, the light seemed to be getting larger and larger as we watched it and it indeed appeared to be getting closer.  It seemed to be over our yard eventually and shining the light right on us.  All of a sudden it was gone.  It was an amazing experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On another evening we had company over and were outside on the deck again when the lights appeared.  This time, there were 2 lights.  Our guests were going insane and my husband and I had to explain that this happens all the time over this mountain range.  The lights seemed to be dancing when all of a sudden, once again, they were gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is not only during the summer months we see them.  One of our bedroom windows also looks out onto the mountain range and I see the lights often, dancing in the sky over the mountain, as I lay there at night trying to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On one afternoon while standing at the top of our long driveway for our daughters school bus, I also witnessed 4 objects in the sky in the opposite direction of the mountain range.  They were silvery looking and almost shaped like a sombrero. they appeared in the sky one at a time and moved around a bit then disappeared as they appeared, one at a time.  There has been a lot of activity in this area for as long as I&#39;ve lived here (23 years).  Not just over the mountain range, but all around the community here.  I&#39;ve never reported anything for fear of being ostracized and thought of as crazy.  However, with more and more of my friends, family and neighbors talking about things they witness, I feel much more at ease discussing it now.<n>

The light then proceeded to a very high attitude.  I watched the light for several minutes.  It moved in all directions and occasionally would give a strange burst of light usually in a triangler shape.  This strange movement of up down circles continued for about 20 minutes in that same area.  I went inside to check on my infant daughter and upon returning outside the light had moved from the northeast sky to the northwestern part.  It wasn&#39;t hard to locate and appeared to continue with the same pattern of movements until about 23:43.  It then simply vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

6/30/11 22:08|Cape Girardeau|MO|Light|2 mins|Orange Light passing over city, silent.|7/4/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82015.html|6|ndxe201106| Orange Light passing over city, silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Went outside to smoke, noticed a bright orange light in the sky moving southeast to northwest.  Assumed it was a firework of some sort because people are shooting them off already in town.  After about 30 seconds or so, it had not dimmed at all and was still progressing at a medium rate of speed, it seemed to grow even brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Called wife and daughter out to look &#39;hurry hurry!&#39;  Took eyes off of it for maybe 10 seconds.  Wife and daughter arrived in time to see it continue it&#39;s travel across the sky, heading away from us towards Jackson, Missouri.  Finally &#39;went out&#39; all at once, but could still see the bottom edge of what ever it was lit by the city lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object was a bright deep orange and looked very bright, like a flare, until it&#39;s light seemed to extinguish, but something was still there.  Was a circular light, bright enough to obscure any other detail of the object until it went out.  Did not &#39;sputter&#39; out like flares typically do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am positive it was not a normal firework, far too long being lit up.  Potentially an orange flare, not red but deep and bright orange attached to something that was able to float along but there was virtually no breeze.  In fact there was absolutely no discernible breeze noted as such because of the temperature and the air conditioning currently on the fritz.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I both in our late 30s, professionals.(I.T. Network Specialist and Medical Coder)  I am a 7 year veteran of the Air Force, familiar with various aircraft (worked on C-130s) and avionics.  It was NOT an airplane or chopper.  Was close enough to our location to have heard some sort of engine noise. Heard no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seemed like it was fairly close and not very large.  Possibly 2000-3000 feet above city.  About half a thumbs width when it was at it&#39;s closest point, growing smaller as it moved away.  Was not moving fast enough or at the correct angle to be a falling star.  Hard to tell it&#39;s actual size and distance because there was no good points of comparison, but &#39;seemed&#39; to be small and fairly close, traveling directly over the town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Left no &#39;trail&#39; or burning bits, was solid until going out.  Had a slight delay in going out, like the decay of stadium lights turned off.  Did not flicker, just quickly faded. Also possible that the light was directional and was turned away from our vantage point.  That might also fit the manner in which it went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Was certainly out of the ordinary.  Daughter described it as &#39;spooky.&#39; Noticed no other effects, like power outage or upset dogs or anything of that nature.  Also do not yet know if anyone else saw it, will try to find any other witnesses via local paper website.  Did not call police or anything, they likely have their hands full enough tonight and it did not seem to pose any threat at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards feel like a goober by not grabbing a camera, but a cell phone video of an orange light isn&#39;t going to help anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have reported in the past other sightings, been several years ago and also investigated another local sighting by a police officer in Cape Girardeau in 2000, speaking briefly with Peter on Jeff Rense&#39;s show.  First thing I have seen in years and it was rather striking.  I would not be adverse to passing any info along to any other local researchers, but there&#39;s not much else to say except perhaps to be a &#39;one more&#39; to the sighting.  I am sure others saw it, given the outdoor activity going on (you could hear fireworks going on all around) but if someone else says anything publicly is another matter.<n>

I was outside in my driveway in roughly 2011 (forgive me as it has been a couple of years so I do not exactly remember the year, since I didn&#39;t lend much credence to it at the time), but, I happened to look up in the sky and saw 3 different 6-triangle shaped lights moving VERY FAST across the sky.  There were NO Red &amp; Green lights that would indicate any aircraft.  I live near an airport so I am used to seeing airplanes flying either overhead or very near my sightline.  These were simply white lights.  These lights were moving so fast that I literally didn&#39;t have enough time to grab my cell phone to record them moving.  There are NO aircraft that move THAT FAST! ,  Plus, I have seen the pictures of the SAME lights that I saw, but, what I saw, there was a group of 2 sets of those lights that over-lapped each other.  Meaning, and looking up and moving West to East, and number the lights from front to back, and left to right, 1 first row, 2-3 second row, 4-5-6 third row, when you see the first set of 6 lights, the second 6-set of lights were in synch, but,  the 2nd row of lights (light #2) overlapped the original 3rd set of lights at light number 6.  Then the last set of 6 lights followed behind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, these lights were moving way to fast to be ANY aircraft!  I have been trying to find something like I saw and your website has EXACTLY what I saw, but not in the cluster that I saw flying over my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to try to find out if there was a &#34;fighter squadron&#34; flying overhead at that time but, there would be NO reason why a &#34;fighter squadron&#34; would be flying over this location at that time of night, and flying faster than the speed of sound, which is the ONLY way ANY objects could be flying that fast. Plus I had no idea HOW to investigate this. Thus, I just keep this to myself until I saw the images on your website. I hope that someone has an explanation to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

While I was stopped for a moment some kind of aircraft flew over to me.  I watched it approach and it came and hovered about 100 feet above me for maybe 5 or 10 seconds.  All I could see of it was a perfect semi circle made of separate lights.  I believe it made an odd sound like a quiet helicopter but I don&#39;t specifically remember the sound.  It seemed about the size of a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point I was very scared and ran back to my house as fast as possible but I believe I saw it flying off to the south after this.  It flew at a very normal speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t remember all the details because afterwards I assumed it was some kind of helicopter and only recently started looking into it and found that there don&#39;t seem to be any kind of aircraft with a semicircle of lights around the front, but there are many suppsed UFO sightings described as a semicircle of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not believe that God created life outside of this planet but I believe that demons are real and deceptive and we must be wary and equipped with sealed protection in a relationship with Jesus Christ.  With Him we have nothing to fear because Jesus is already victorious over satan.<n>

I have read multiple other reports lately from nearby Myrtle Beach, SC, and Holden Beach, NC, of strange orange lights appearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On June 30th, while sitting outside alone around 9 PM, I am watching the sky over the ocean, but don&#39;t see anything unusual until I glance behind me to the North toward Ocean Isle airport (which is only a mile away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the exact area where you would normally see an airplane on downwind leg to runway 24 at the airport, I watch a steady orange light cruising in a straight line near the airport, &#34;silently&#34;, for about 15 seconds before fading out completely.  It appeared to be cruising around 100 knots and to be between me and the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later, a small general aviation plane flew almost the same pattern with the expected engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange light was definitely not part of a conventional aircraft, due to the speed combined with the lack of noise.<n>

We were convinced that it was an asteroid or something crazy like that, although there was no trail of smoke.  It disappeared past the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10 min later I seen this object shoot back up into the sky using the same path it had descended from.  Once it reached a comfortable level in the sky it quickly changed its shape into a silver Ball and shot across the sky through a lightning storm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To our suprise 30 min later there were even more objects in the sky that were unknown and making very quick movements dodging aircrafts and sneaking up behind them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This to me is the real deal, something one has to see to believe.

I saw some meteors, aircraft, and a few satellites pass over.  Nothing really out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then at exactly 3:50am (I did a time check right after this), I saw these two bright, white lights moving away from me to the southeast.  They weren&#39;t blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The southern most one was slightly ahead of the other one.  They were moving about the speed of an aircraft, but these were too far apart to be lights on one airplane, but still very close together in the sky.  I don&#39;t think it was two lights on one big object because they both seemed to move independently of each other.  I also heard no aircraft noise at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were both brighter than a satellite usually is.  I&#39;ve seen ISS fly over before and they were about that bright, but the one trailing behind the other one suddenly got even brighter, like someone moved a dimmer switch up.  It got brighter for about 5-10 seconds, pulsing slightly, and then they both started to get dimmer and then they disappeared behind some trees.

6/30/11 00:00|North Shore Oahu|HI|Oval|3 minutes|North Shore Oahu Ball of Fire.|8/30/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/101/S101478.html|23|ndxe201106| North Shore Oahu Ball of Fire<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aloha 	I wish to file a report of a sighting I personally witnessed.  This incident took place in the summer of 2011 on the island of Oahu Hawai’i.  The reason for the delay in submitting this report is that I was unaware of your reporting site and I was not a Coast to Coast listener until earlier this year. Even though I’m a Coast listener,  I hesitate to report because I believe most of what I hear on coast is a fabrication of the callers.  Most of these people are wack jobs in my opinion.  It was not until I heard the stories of “Fireballs” making 90 degree turns that the hairs on the back of my neck stood and I realized that I too am a wack job.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I mentioned above that it was the summer of 2011 on a Friday or Saturday night late possibly very early morning.  I was at the famous Sunset Beach with a couple of new acquaintances.  My job would take me to the North Shore of Oahu every Thursday night where I worked as an auditor.  Friday mornings was the beginning of my weekends for partying on the famous North Shore.  I slept in my vehicle at Sunset Beach as to be the first and last at the endless parties.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of the sighting it was late and I determined this because the only people for some time was myself, two others whom I met recently and a few party goers on Sunset Point toward the east of the beach down near the water.  The partiers had a bomb fire as did that location almost every night.  I and the other two people were standing on the walkway in front of my vehicle talking story.  I had been drinking beer as I did every weekend. I must have drank at least a six pack by that time.  This was not an uncommon amount of alcohol for me. I can drink large amount of beer without problems.  Anyway, I was speaking to one of the other two people in my company.  We were discussing the bomb fire at the point.  That’s when the third person in my company made a comment about the fire. I said to him “what do you think we are talking about?” He replied “No! Not that fire. That fire.” Pointing above and to our right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked in the direction he was pointing;  I saw a ball of fire traveling toward us. It seemed only a few seconds before the ball of fire had passed directly in front of our location.  It was just above the beach between us and the water.  It seemed close enough to throw a rock and hit it.  It was maybe twenty yards above and in front of us.  It clearly was a ball of fire with flames moving around it’s circumference.  It was orangeish red. The ball of fire did not stop and seemed to be traveling about 30 mph.  When it was directly in front of us as if it were for our benefit; between us and the water over the beach it changed directions in a perfect 90 degree turn. IMPOSSIBLE; I thought.  It than seem to accelerate directly out to sea away from us.  It seemed that it was about five to eight seconds before it’s illumination was no longer seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and the two others were astonished by what we witnessed.  There was a lot of “did you see that?” as if one of us may have somehow missed something.  After only a few moments of discussion the two others had changed the subject and as for me, I was still searching the sky above the ocean for answers.  I then turned to them and said “How can that 90 degree turn be possible?”  	In the following months I continued my weekend ritual of parting at Sunset Beach.  I was cautious to avoid contact with the other two. I did not want to appear a freak to other frequent party goers of Sunset. Then months later I was in conversation with a couple of other persons.  The conversation was about objects that appear under water at night.  The person telling the story said that the light under water appeared florescent green.  That’s when another person listening interrupted and stated, “Wait to you see the balls of fire flying”.  I immediately blurted out “you’ve seen them too??”  My friend the person mentioning the flying ball of fire said “you spend enough time in the north shore, you will see them.  My friend has spent much of his 65 years on the North Shore of Oahu.  He claims to have seen them more than once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the time since that incredible night on the North Shore; I have replayed it in my mind. I try to think in details cautious not to add unseen details. My first focus for some time was the 90 degree directional change. I was in the US Marines and had spent a lot of time flying in Helicopters and planes.   My father was in the US Air force and we live near base growing up. NEVER in the air, on land or sea can the direction change be possible whether at a stopped position or in movement as was the case that night.  I finally gave up on the direction change as I could not explain it.  I then moved on to who?  Or What?  I considered where I was and where it happened.  The Island of Oahu! This is key. The Island of Oahu is likely the most protected area in the world.  Sunset Beach on the North Shore of Oahu is only a few miles from the location where the Japanese came ashore back in December 7, 1941.  Oahu has in the north part of the island military training sites to include restric! ted areas just behind the hill line where we stood that night.  The Island has many military posts for the US Navy, Marines, Army, Air Force and Coast Guard.  I come to the conclusion that it must be us, as in the United States. Just east of Sunset Beach located on a hill top is two large round globe like buildings. They say it’s a radar station.  It’s in the direction the “fire ball” came.  If this fire ball was alien, then would not the radar station spotted it and one of the many fighter jets stationed within miles be in pursuit?  I had not seen no other object or plane in the sky that night. It must be us as in the United States.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My most recent focus of detail that night is the fire ball itself.  The size seemed to be about twice that of a sports utility vehicle.  The color was as mentioned an orange ish red.  The shape was a perfect ball.  The texture was flames in motion around the entire surface.  That’s when I realized two important details.  These details defied logic as much as a 90 degree directional change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flames the covered its entire circumference did not stretch behind the object like a tail when in motion.  The flames appeared tight to the shape of the ball and moving around it almost as if the fire was within the ball seeking a way of release to the outside.  I also recalled that it appear to illuminate the ocean’s surface below it as it made its way out to sea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also noticed that the direction of travel was near dead North out to sea.  This was interesting because the Hawai’i Island chain north of Oahu continues with Kauai to the Northwest of Oahu.  The next Island after being even further toward west and so on.  Where was this ball of fire traveling to?  The direction was an indication that its destination was not a nearby Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In addition I recalled that it made no sound.  We were within yards if not feet of it while it was in motion and no sound.  The area where the sighting took place was quite at that time of night.  Finally the last incredible detail recalled to this date is that the fire ball as big as two sports utility vehicles covered in flames close enough to hit with a rock produced no heat.  This detail probably would have been over looked by me if not for the fact I have been to a Nasa Shuttle launch.  The location I viewed Columbia’s launch was the nearest allowed. It was on the base located in Central Florida.  I was told our location at that launch was three miles from the pad.  The one thing most that stands out about that day at the Shuttle launch was the heat everyone felt when so far away.  I remember thinking that day that if the wind were stronger we would all be suffering from burns.  Unlike the shuttle, the fire ball was silent and without heat radiating from its flames.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for reading.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We have several motion detection lights around the yard which had activated, thus flooding the yard with light.  My wife had a long busy day and stated that she was going to retire to bed.  Since it was such a clear and starry night, I urged her to remain still for a bit, and let the motion detector lights shut off; so that we could get a good look at the stars before we retired for the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short time with the lights off and as we gazed at the stars in a northeasterly direction my wife noticed the big dipper off to our left.  I turned my head left to the northwest to look towards the dipper and just as I was turning back towards the northeastern sky; I observed two circular objects the size of a dime, in relation to the sky, with a faint orange glow silently flying or floating across the night sky.  They were coming from a northwesterly direction and heading east towards the Long Island Sound.  The objects were in close and perfect unison, approximately an inch apart in the night sky and at about 45 degrees above the horizon.  The orange glow was brighter on the forward sides of the circles and lightened up towards the rear or left sides of the circles.  My observation lasted about 8 to 10 seconds before they passed behind a large tree and were then out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to my wife and asked if she had seen the objects and she replied &#34;yes&#34;.  I then asked her what she thought they were.  She was quite spooked, shrugged her shoulders and questioned, &#34;A helicopter?&#34;  I replied, &#34;Did you hear any noise&#34;, and she hesitantly replied, &#34;no&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Upon discussing this occurrence, I asked my wife why she replied that it was a helicopter and she stated, &#34; Because I&#39;ve never seen anything else fly so low in the sky before.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us, my wife 61 years old and I 58 have ever in our lives seen anything like this, we both concluded that we had just observed a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptionally objective, and eloquent, individual.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness, and quite capable of reporting accurately what he and his wife had observed.  PD))<n>

After awhile my eyes drifted up towards and sky and I started to star gaze.  Some time after I started to star gaze, I became fixed on a certain star that seemed to keep holding my attention.  It was noticeably brighter than most other stars that were visible that night, and have a very characteristic amber color to it.  However, after studying it a bit longer, it appeared to be much closer in terms of distance than the other stars that were visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maybe another ten minutes of studying this star, it started to move at a very slow and steady pace.  I started to think maybe it was just aircraft, although it was much, much too high to be an commercial airliner.  This lead me to believe it could have just been a satellite.  Yet, those thoughts were soon pushed out of my mind completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2-3 minutes after it initially started to cruise, the object stopped, and then started to go back to the space where it came from.  It continued to move back and forth in this manner for 3-4 minutes.  At this point I was certain it wasn&#39;t an aircraft or a satellite.  I kept looking at the object, thinking maybe my eyes were just playing tricks on me from staring at one place for so long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked away for a minute or two to rest my eyes, then looked back up towards the object.  After staying stationary for a few more moments, it started to move again, but this time in multiple different directions.  It would go forward, back, side-to-side, etc., all while coming to complete stops multiple times and then continuing to move about (almost as if inertia had no effect on it).  This continued for about ten minutes, and during this time I was able to point it out to my friend who also confirmed that he could see the object moving.  I&#39;d like to note that while it was moving, a faint trail of light followed behind it, resembling a sort of little tail at the end of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time, it was after 11:00 PM.  The object remained stationary for quite some time after it had done all that moving about (but stayed in the same general area the whole time).  I kept my eye on it, waiting for it to make its next move.  After staying in place for about 15 minutes, the object moved again, this time moving in an arc pattern that was EXTREMELY noticeable.  Seeing it move this way made it certain that my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  After this, it continued its previous moving patterns from the beginning, which I continued to observe until approx. 11:50 PM.  At that time I drove home, the object still being there when I left.  Unfortunately, the area this occurred at is not visible from where I live, so once I left my friend&#39;s house, I was only left to wonder how long it stayed there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel it&#39;s important to note that I felt very, &#34;otherworldly,&#34; when I was observing this object. While this sounds a bit cliché, I definitely felt something when looking at it.  Some sort of connection possibly, that I could feel that this object was not of this world.  Then again, I could have just been awestruck. I plan to keep an eye on the night skies more often, though.<n>

I opened the door that leads to the backyard to let my dog out, and stepped out too.  It was dark and i looked up at the sky, i saw a very very very very very bright diamond shaped flying object in the sky,  I thought it was an airplane but then i realized it wasn&#39;t blinking and it was way too bright and oddly shaped to be one.  I rubbed my eyes and closed each eye to see if it was still there after.  It wasn&#39;t exactly flying in a straight line.  It was flying in a slightly curved u shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then as it got closer to a star in the sky it started fading away till it disappeared.  I had called my mum during this but as usual she took her own sweet time to come outside, but she did stop me from stepping backward into the pool.  She unfortunately missed what i saw and instead thought i was looking up into my bedroom window .<n>

I noticed something that looked like it could have been a star or a planet begin to move slowly across the sky.  I pointed it out to him and we watched it slowly move in a strange arc across the sky.  It was a brilliant white light that was so bright, it had a starburst effect, making it look like an asterisk.  It moved well across the sky for no longer than five minutes.  Suddenly, the light dimmed quickly to a tiny red dot, and then it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college student, my boyfriend is a labor worker, and we have an infant.  We&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.  We could see planes in the sky that night - they were much, much lower than this light.

This was around 9:00pm.  I noticed the objects appear on the ocean horizon (probably closest point of approach around 4 miles).  While looking at the end of the pier, the two orange/red oval objects appeared to the right (south/southwest-40 degrees from the end of the pier).  I instantly showed my wife and Family.  The other witnesses (about 15 other people saw it as well, including the waitress at the open air restuarant).  The objects were flying in formation and stopped on a dime.  They were hovering when my son shined his lasar pointer on one of the objects.  The lights in both craft cut off instantly (you could see the laser on it) and when he stopped with the lasar, the lights to the craft came BACK ON and the two objects zipped 2 miles south (estimate), stopped on a dime again and then shot STRAIGHT up towards the atmosphere.  These objects were manuvering in a manner unlike any aircraft known to me and defied the laws of physics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: the objects portrayed more of an orange color than the red color that was witnessed.  I am a trained US Navy Veteran who worked with radar and many aircraft operations (honorably discharged) and I am a Project  Manager for a Mechanical Engineering firm.  I will be glad to talk with someone and to sign any statements (thanks for talking with me today Mr. Davenport!).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Best regards,<n>

At 14:25 we were 1.6 km south-east of Steinker.  At this time we saw a light in the sky move from north to south.  The light moved from one side of the sky to the other in less than 20 seconds, a very great speed as I am sure you will agree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light also looked like it was very high in the sky, maybe two or three times the altitude airliners fly at, but I cannot be sure.  The object was almost as bright (vivid?) as the Sun looks in the sky, and about 25% as large as the Sun looks in the sky, so quite easy to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The shape of the light:  Ellipse.  The light did leave behind a condensation track, so the light must have been hot.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw this light I thought it was a meteoroid, as I have seen videos of meteoroids which looked similar to what I saw.  When I got home that evening, myself and my freind who also saw this light used the internet to understand and research what we had seen.  Strangely, no websites, not even websites that measured meteoroid activity over Scandinavia had information on what we saw.  There was nothing on these websites yesterday, and nothing today.  These websites are &#39;updated&#39; every 1 hour, too.  There seems to be NO information on what I saw, which is strange.  Because of this, I am not sure what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

The object was traveling, from the best that I could gather, from northeast to southwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It did not make any noise that I could hear and was flying relatively fast until it disappeared into the distance toward Henderson, Kentucky.  In size comparisons, the object was about 5 times the size of a star in the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will be the first to admit that I honestly have no idea what I saw.

We watched a bright light, what appeared to be a star come out of a tree line.  It then slowly crossed the highway. It appeared t be hovering once it crossed highway for about 30 seconds before flying off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It flew away rather slowly and made zero noise.  The light it gave off appeared to glow as if it were a star.  I was able to capture a couple still photos of object and a 59 second video clip with my iPhone 4.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m extremely curious as to what this is.  I&#39;ve always been a skeptic of most UFO sightings but I have never seen anything like this.  Would love to have a logical answer to what this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appears to be a star except the fact it was flying across horizon.

There I was told that about an hour earlier that my two friends had seen a glowing orange circular object that &#34;was semi-fast,&#34; with no noise at all.  I quickly put it off as either some sort of meteor or asteroid that had flown through our atmosphere.  They assured me that it was nothing they had seen before and was too big to be either of those.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Skip to around 11:30pm, I was driving away from their house and saw a bright orange glowing ball in the sky that I first identified as a fire work in the air that had not yet exploded.  After a few seconds I realized that it was not firework and it was heading my way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stayed parked in my car I watched as this orange circle flew over.  It was really bright, was about the size comparable to a quarter or half dollar, made absolutely no noise, and seemed to be at the same distance from earth an airplane would fly at.  Even though this UFO was really bright I felt like I could see some sort of outline around it but could not make out the shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flight pattern was relatively straight, and according to my friend’s story was traveling the same exact direction the first time they watched it.  The speed was relatively fast for the distance it was away, but seemed a lot slower than what a airplane would travel.  By the time I had called them and had driven back to their house the object had become smaller and disappeared out of site.  I did get a hold of my friends in time for them to actually see the object to confirm that it was the same.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did some research to see if it was one of the so called &#34;Chinese lanterns,&#34; but it was way too bright and large for it to be one of these.<n>

6/28/11 23:00|Lexington|KY|Sphere|approx 2 min|Orange orbs flying at 500 feet elevation in a formation.

Three in a line and a fourth trailing behind<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was upstairs in bed when my friend came up after viewing late nite news at approximately 11:50 pm on June 28, 2011.  He screamed at me from the other upstairs bedroom to come and see these objects.  They were four orange orbs flying in formation at a low altitude towards our home..about 500 feet above ground-helicopter flight space for our police helicopters..there were three in a line around 50 yards apart and one behind around 100 yards flying directly behind the middle orb.  We rushed downstairs and watched.  They executed a 45 degree turn and crossed our yard at a slow speed...never changing formation.  They were the size of the full moon about three quarters up in the sky and there was movement inside like moving crystals..sooo hard to describe and the air was disturbed around them..Very scary. There was absolutely no sound from the objects.  I went inside and got my camara.  I was very excited and fumbling with the camera.  I managed to get them in s! ight as they moved over the houses behind my home.  I was so upset I forgot to take the flash off.  When I took the picture the sky lit up and the back orb went out...just like that...Then as they moved on it came back on more dimly.  Unfortunately, the flash blackened out the sky and took a pic of my patio umbrella which was in the side forground of the pic.  We called the police, a tv station and I spoke with an air traffic controller at the airport, but at that time no one had reported these things.  We later checked chinese laterns, but these things were under control.  They stayed in formation and one extinguished the light in response to my camera flash!  We have sketches of what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was leaving the next morning, so I was sitting out by the lake before going to bed.  As I was walking back to the house I looked at the sky to the ssw and saw an orange orb.  My first thought was that I had not heard that Jupiter was going to be exceptionally visible that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my mind was trying to make sense of what I was looking at a cloud of vapor appeared near the orb and then it looked as though the orb sucked in the vapor, then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this happened in about 30 seconds and there was no sound related to this occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, from about the same place the orb was, there were trees around where I saw the orb, I heard what sounded like a plane.  The &#34;plane&#34; that flew out over the lake was like nothing I had seen before.  It was flying away from me and had a bank of four &#34;taillights.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Those were the only lights I could see, they were also orange and were on constantly, no blinking lights.  The two in the middle had a pattern, the outside two were just plain light.  It flew out over the lake and banked in a way I have never seen a plane turn before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again there was some vapor that appeared and was absorbed but it kept flying until it was out of sight beyond the trees.<n>

This year we stayed at North Beach Plantation in North Myrtle and really had a good time.  On our second to last night there, my girlfriend and I grabbed two beach chairs and headed to the ocean around 9:10 to relax!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a 10-15 minute walk we arrived to the beach and were looking for a place to sit.  As we were walking south, with the Atlantic Ocean to our left, I looked at the sky and noticed three orange/reddish lights that resembled a perfect triangle.  I dropped the chairs and couldn&#39;t get the words out of my mouth fast enough to tell my girlfriend to look as she was beside me.  We both saw the lights hovering for about 1-1/2 minutes before it completely vanished.  We sat for about an hour after that and rolled out every single possibility from a plane, fireworks, ship, moon, local airport, stars, parachutes, etc.   We were not under the influence of any d! rugs or alcohol and had no explanation for what we saw.  I NEVER believed in any type of UFO&#39;s, aliens, whatever.. but after seeing what I saw, I&#39;m a believer!  We left around 11pm and went back to the house and looked online to see if anyone posted anything like this on the internet in the area, and low and behold there was.  Someone else spotted the same thing a few months back.  I almost feel like I should have to justify myself and explain that I&#39;m not seeing things or that I&#39;m in perfect health and not delusional, but I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are actually headed back to Myrtle for another vacation in a few weeks and are eager to see this again.<n>

They looked similar to aircraft strobes that you can  see on various high altitude aircraft traffic 5 to 10 miles away that are  visible on any clear night.  But these lights were so jumping around so fast in the distance, that it could not be one aircraft on a set course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last sighting that night, was of two orange! lights very low over the water, slowing rotating around each other before fading out.  I would estimate the distance of the lights at 2 miles.  The motion of the two lights resembled what you would see if  a small aircraft was banking its wings at night, except of course both lights were orange instead of one red and one green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Those two then faded out completely.<n>

At first I thought it was just a plane, and maybe my eyes were not focused or something as many planes fly in the same general direction because of the airport a few miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed it was not flying like a plane and the lights did not match to what I usually see with a plane.  It was flying in a more &#34;casual&#34; manner.  That is the best way I can describe it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights across what I call the top made the triangle shape very apparent but it also had two to three lights below which made it look like a triangle with a stick pointing to the ground vertically below it.  That is the best way I can describe that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn’t judge the distance between me and it in the sky but it appeared to be close to my location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was waiting for it to get closer, the object casually started an upward ascent.  The lights started to &#34;fade&#34; out and it just vanished.  There was no where it could hide in the sky.  There were a few thin clouds but not enough to cover whatever it was or keep me from losing sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was flying in my direction and then it’s gone!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 30 to 40 minutes before dark (dusk).  I’d say 2 1/2 minutes to 3 minutes from the time I noticed it flying my way.<n>

I have read multiple other reports lately from nearby Myrtle Beach, SC, and Holden Beach, NC of similar orange lights appearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Let me describe my 3 recent sightings:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6-9-11: I saw at least 4 stationary orange lights blink on and off a few miles out over the ocean around 8 PM.  When I saw the first one , which was due South at about 25 degrees elevation, my first thought was it was  plane switching on its landing light as it was nearing Ocean isle airport.  The light was only on for about 10 seconds and then went out.  Over the next 15-30n minutes, I saw the same thing repeated at least 3 more times in different spots in the same vicinity over the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6-28-11: This was the most interesting sighting, which was also witnessed by my 15 year old daughter and 13 year old son.  Around 9 PM , my daughter comes inside the house to say she thinks she saw a UFO.  When I go out, I see an orange light near the spot of the one on June 16th and we watch it until it fades out.  For the next hour between periodic orange lights appearing, we also see faint twinkling lights similar to aircraft strobe lights  which randomly twinkle in different spots in the southern sky over the ocean.  They looked similar to aircraft strobes that you can  see on various high altitude aircraft traffic  5 to 10 miles away that are  visible on any clear night.  But these lights were so jumping around so much in the distance, that I was not one aircraft on a set course.  The last sighting that night, was of two orange lights slowing rotating around each other before fading out.  The motion of the two lights resembled what you would see if  a small aircraft was banking its wings at night, except of course both lights were orange instead of one red and one green.  Those two then faded out completely<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6-30-11: While sitting outside alone around 9 PM, I am watching the sky over the ocean,  but don&#39;t see anything until I glance behind me to the North toward Ocean Isle airport ( which is only a mile away).  Just in an area where you would see an airplane on downwind leg to the airport, I watch a steady orange light cruising over the airport , no sound, for about 15 seconds before fading out completely.  That was the only sighting that night.<n>

There were no blinking lights to indicate this was an airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was very low to the earth compared to the distance flown by airplanes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A low humming noise could be heard, but that may have been due to something else.<n>

I knew something was so strange about it to I continued to watch it for about 30 seconds until it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then used my cell phone to try to capture the craft again and I did.  I saw farther south in the sky and I turned to find it in the sky.  This time is was triangular because I was closer to the craft and it flew in a odd direction and flew away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have the full video to share with the National UFO Reporting Center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I posted this video on youtube but I will send you the link so you can see this video and try to get it out there to the public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://youtu.be/_6tbnLnYDR0<n>

Only visible from our campsite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My best friend back at home in Illinois witnessed the same ufo a couple days later while driving in the car at night with our good friend, this was probably near Hampshire, Illinois.  They both saw it doing odd and fast zig zagged motions across the sky, high up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since these sightings, I have begun to see ufos on a regular basis.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last week on Friday, my girlfriend and I saw the same or a similar orb hovering in the sky, for about 10 minutes, near the constellation scorpius,  except it stayed still, moved very slowly a short distance, and then we watched it disappear.  This sighting was in Elgin, Illinois off of Mclean and 20.  I! saw a similar still orb last night while driving home in the sky but it was glowing white, also watched it disappear in the sky.  While swimming outside at night, my best friend and girlfriend witnessed three separate orbs which we considered undoubtedly to be ufos<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At first we thought it was an old airplane, the kind that was just made of all sheet metal, because the reflection off of this object was extremely bright, almost blinding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I pointed out to my friend that I didn’t think it was an airplane due to its movement (of which there was none, it was just hovering there), it rolled (it was almost like a tumbler rolling in midair), and spun overhead.  With that simple twist, it became a bright circle, and it shot ahead of us towards the lake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within seconds the point of light was across Lake Erie, towards Canada, and could not be seen anymore.  It left no trail, no sounds, nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The person I was with is a skeptic, and even he was dumbfounded as to how it could just disappear without a trace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was able to snap a photo on my cell phone camera, right when it was doing its little tumble.  It is not the greatest, but you can tell there is definitely something there.<n>

The object was small in size but clearly visible in a cloudless sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a period of about 3 or 4 minutes the object suddenly broke pattern and made a beeline to the northwest at a relatively high rate of speed (much faster than an airplane).  I watched until the object disappeared from my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with several family members at the time who were not able to see the object themselves with the naked eye.  After the incident I realized I was the only one wearing polarized sunglasses which apparently made the object more visible.<n>

These appeared to be about half the size of a dime held at arm’s length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the spheres was leaving this tight cluster and going out about the distance of 40 or so of the spheres.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a slight haze around the cluster, and a smaller haze around the individual object, but the spheres at the center were CLEARLY visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Confused as to what I was seeing, I removed my prescription sunglasses (which are polarized), and put on my non-polarized indoor prescription glasses.  With these glasses on, the objects were COMPLETELY invisible against the bright blue sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For nearly five minutes, I watched them with my sunglasses on, and during this time I tried to watch them several more times with my normal glasses.  The objects remained invisible to my non-polarized glasses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approximately five minutes, the objects began heading west towards the mountain at a fairly high rate of apparent speed.<n>

I was half asleep myself, and told her to go back to sleep, that she was having a bad dream.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She replied that she was not dreaming, but that there are two triangle star things outside in the sky.  I told her not to be afraid that she was just having a bad dream and she said, &#34;No I’m not, I’m looking at them right now.  I can see them through the window.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Unfortunately, I did not get out of bed to investigate, but went back to sleep.  My daughter doesn’t get nightmares, but I was very tired and groggy that night, and I am generally fearless, so I didn’t give it much heed until the morning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter was very clear on the description, and drew the shape for me.  She said they were triangular, but with rounded edges, white, cloud-like in color, sort of like light, but without lights. They were quite a bit bigger than the stars, moving around mostly slowly.  One flew faster in a semi-circle around the other, then up and down.  There was no noise, and they gave her a terrified feeling.  I am not sure how long it lasted, because after a min. or so, she was too scared to watch anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wouldn’t have thought to report it but when I came across this site and saw that somebody else had reported black triangles in the same little town in Jan. and that a &#34;haunting feeling&#34; came over him/her,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wondered if more people have seen and experienced similar things in this area.<n>

When we got about a mile away from the house we saw a bright light through the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We soon entered a section of the road that was positioned between two open fields with a clear view of the sky in all directions.  The road was heading North-North-East during the first part of the sighting.  We observed the object for about 20 seconds before heading into tree cover again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 15 more seconds passed and we pulled into the driveway.  I immediately got out and ran to the field behind my house, (the same field on the right side of the previously mentioned road), and the object was still there.  At this time it was about 11:10 and I was facing east.  Two or three miles a head of me, and a little to the left was the object moving slowly to the right.  I called out for my mom to come quick but she didn’t get to see it again in its brightest form.  As soon as I called for her, the object  started quickly moving south eastward toward a cell phone tower one mile away from where I was.  I know this distance for a fact so I used the tower as a reference point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could distinctly make out the fact that it moved behind the tower because the light dimmed for a split second.  After crossing behind the tower, the craft slowed down and slowly descended behind a nearby wooded hill near a residential street.  I DID NOT see the craft land, I simply saw it decrease altitude.  By now I had seen the craftchange directions from moving North East to South East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was in an oval shape and was a very bright, non-pulsating figure.  It changed directions quickly and accelerated quickly and slowed quickly. It did not zig- zag.  The color was a very bright yellowish white and it was brighter than the cell phone tower by far and much brighter than any of the stars.  The craft was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had just stormed and there was partial cloud cover. There was also a great deal of lightning, but none during the actual sighting.  There were two conventional aircraft in the area that I have great confidence saw the same thing that I was seeing, because they immediately turned in the direction of the aircraft in question.<n>

My goal is to get solid evidence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A month ago this object appeared while my friend was over and I pointed it out to him.  A week after I was in the yard with my girlfriend and I pointed it out to her.  This object goes from a dim light to a bright ice blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 6/27/11 and 6/28/11,  my brother and I were in the backyard.  I told him he would see something and we did.  On the 27th the bright ice blue object glided across the sky from west to east.  On the 28th the object glided from the northwest to southeast, but this time it was a bright white and a major rumbling occured at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in the Belltown area of Stamford, CT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If anyone else has seen these objects I&#39;d like to get your point of view.<n>

There were so many clipping across the sky at such a high speed I was mesmerized and then I got really scared.  I went inside and told my mom to come look at what I was seeing and when we got back outside they were gone.  I call what I saw a fleet of UFOs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never ever before had I seen a UFO and I tried really hard to convince myself that what I was seeing was NOT UFOs but I have no doubt as to what I saw.  I have seen very similar video of what I saw.  I couldn&#39;t count them but for some reason the number 84 (towards the end of my watching) was a number I would have guestimated.  It was exciting yet very scary.  I always look now just in case.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The evening was slightly cloudy but not so much that I was mistaken in what I saw.  The stars had not come out yet but it was late in the evening.  I have lived here most all of my life, with all kinds of military including Langley AFB so I would have known if I were seeing fighter jets.  It was not anything like I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at this form a couple of days ago and decided to wait before posting my sighting.  Today however, I feel it&#39;s time to share what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did look the next day for any reports of meteor showers or anything that could explain what I saw but there was nothing.  Not even a report from anyone else via the news as to what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now wonder if I am the only one who witnessed this.  Sadly...I did not get photos  :(<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
6/26/11 23:30|North Babylon|NY|Light|15 minutes|2 sperate sighting I will never forget!|3/13/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/087/S87374.html|78|ndxe201106| 2 sperate sighting I will never forget!<n> <n><n> <n><n> February 26, 2012:  Multiple UFO Sighting from Long Island   I am from Long Island NY. I have several sightings to report they are from different years and the reason I am reporting several at once is because I did not know there was a national UFO reporting center to submit claims too as I have always believed up until my first sighting that UFO’S were simply &#34;TOP SECRET MILITARY AIRCRAFT.&#34; The first sighting I ever had changed my mind in the blink of an eye and I have the image of what I saw that night burned in my memory for ever.  Being experienced with airplanes and how much air traffic is over me on a daily basis I am well aware of what a regular plane or helicopter looks like and these sightings were without a doubt neither of them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sighting #1- it was January 5th 2008 and I was traveling on the long island express way going west bound at about 65-70 mph. I was in the car with my older sister and 3 of my friends in the back seat of my car.  It was a pretty cloudy night and this is why I knew what I saw was not any type of aircraft I am familiar with or currently exist. I glanced out my window for a second and just so happened to glance up at the sky and I noticed what appeared to be a white ball of light below the clouds moving at a speed I thought was very strange. JFK and Laguardia airports are both in the area and if I had to guess an estimate I would say the lowest clouds that night were about 5-7 thousand feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am experienced with air traffic and planes as I have 50 hours in a Cessna 152 and have been obsessed with the military since I was a kid. I am well aware that around major airports there is a limit on air speeds depending on the class of airspace you are in when flying by or over them.  The white ball of light I witness had to be between 3500-4500 feet in the air and was moving at a speed much faster than regulation speed allowed if I had to guess I would say it was moving at about 500-600 knots.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the probably 20-30 second I saw this object I noticed it had no strobe lights and did not seem to be flying in a traffic pattern consistent with the airport. I found all of this very strange and I would of never guess what was going to happen next as it seem to have opened a new world to me on what might really be going on.  As I was looking at the object moving at an incredible speed it seemed to pulsate once as it appeared the light got brighter for a split second and then it quickly dashed off into the clouds at a speed that did not seem possible and I did not see it again.  The 4 people I was with this night driving all saw the same thing I did and when it dashed off into the clouds as fast as it did the car went silent for about 15 minutes as we were in disbelief at what we just saw happen and till this day my friends talk about it very little as I think it scared or weirded them out to a level they didn’t think was possible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second sighting was on july 26th 2011 this time located from my house in Suffolk county long island at about 1130 at night. I was outside in my court as I usually am during the summer with my step sister her bf and 2 of my friends.  My step sister noticed this bright light coming from the north to use a landmark it appeared to be coming in a direction from the long island sound and straight down as I live on the south end of long island so it would be heading toward the atlantic ocean.  When I first looked at the light I noticed it I could not really get an idea of how fast it was really moving as it appeared to slow down and then speed up just a bit at times.  As it was coming south I knew that sometimes the head lights on the bigger planes are so bright you can’t see the nav and strobe lights until they get directly over you or are moving away.  As it started getting closer I knew something was wrong as there was no noise of any type of jet or other type of airplane engine.  Also is it got directly over us there were no strobes or nav lights and the brightness of the light did not change it stayed consistently bright from every angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got over us it also seemed to completely stop for about 5 or 6 second and then continued south and we followed it until it got over the tree line and we could no longer see it. I don’t know what I saw in either of these cases but they were certainly not aircraft from this country unless they have something I don’t know about. If that is the case though I don’t see why the government would be hiding this great technology and not using to their full advantage. I do know one thing for sure though something was indeed flying these objects and it had to of had great intelligence for the way they were moving. I hope one day someone can explain what me and my friends saw.<n>

The entire parameter ((sic. Perimeter)) of the craft was outlined in bright white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hanging low in the sky and was immobile.  One flashing white light was pointed towards WPAFB and was blinking on and off.  I could not detect the color of the craft as it was dark outside.  It almost looked like it was black or invisible but could detect an outline; like black against a black sky.  The circular craft had a half circle bubble on top of the circular base and that also had lights around the parameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off on the Harshman road exit and pulled my car into the Riverside police station for a better look.  It was hovering right over the overpass very low to the road.  I rolled down my window and could not detect any noise.  I was surprised that no one else was pulling over to view this strange craft as it was so low to the road and very out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about five minutes since I drove upon the craft and pulled over that the craft very slowly descended into the base area until I could not see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I relayed these events to my friend and she posted this to her facebook page asking if anyone else saw this.  Two other people wrote back stating they saw the same thing around the same time.  Not sure if this was some prototype from the air force base or if this was something else. Did not see any other airplanes or other crafts around the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I will say that twenty years ago when I was ten years of age, I saw an identical looking craft above my old house that was located ten miles from the sighting previously stated.  It was around the same time at night.  It had the same blinking white light that flashed into my bedroom blinking on and off for ten or fifteen minutes.  The blinking light made rectangle shapes on my bedroom walls.  I brushed it off as car lights until I noticed the blinking lights weren&#39;t stopping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked out the window and saw the same circular craft with lights around the parameter (sic.  Perimeter) hovering very low to the ground not making any noise.  It frightened me and I ran and told my parents.  Of course, it was gone by the time they came to investigate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wanted to mention this older past experience as the craft of Sunday&#39;s experience was identical in appearance and behavior.<n>

I skywatch every night and had just gone out, facing west, clear dark night, when a beautiful bright, sparkling object appeared towards the south, and silently moved at a height lower than our few commercial flyovers, quite slowly and steadily without variation in altitude, apparently heading north-northwest.  I of course assumed it was a plane—and from my angle it did seem to be a flat elliptical shape, but I knew the colors were wrong:  red at the rear, gold at the front, with the lights moving and interplaying into brilliant orange and a coppery gold at the center.  No separation between the lights and colors.  They weren’t flashing but instead moving and pulsing, really lovely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After only a few seconds of watching this, the lights all suddenly and uniformly dimmed and got hazy and changed character and it looked like a tiny version of a nebula cloud like I’ve seen in Hubble photos—but then I was distracted by a sudden narrow streak of dull white light that shot down, from some distance southward behind the “craft,” straight down to the ground (which I thought well, this could be a meteor, just without luminosity which isn’t uncommon).  Then the original “craft” immediately got bright again, back to red and orange and gold, and traveled only a short distance more when it just disappeared.  I waited and searched the sky to see if it reappeared but it didn’t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 30 seconds later, another one appeared from almost the same point of origin, again out of nowhere, again silently and fairly slowly traveled the same flight path, but this one was all gold light and the light was more steady and the “craft” seemed a bit smaller.  When it got to the point where the first one had dimmed, it vanished.  All of this took between 1 – 2 minutes.  Nothing more occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had not myself heard of any UFO sightings with orange as a key color but I’ve now googled and see there are some, including multiple sightings in Washington in 2009.<n>

Did not make any sound at all. Somtimes it looked as if it had wings other times it looked oval.  Very high up but below the cloud cover.  Also seemed to have a glowing ring around the craft.<n>

I noticed that there was two constant lights the one to the south was brighter than the one to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a vague triangular silhouette of the craft and an intermittent red white and green flashing light pointing to the west.  It appeared to be rotating slowly at about 25 Degrees per minute in a clockwise direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage point the craft was at a true north bearing of 255.  The wind was blowing out of the south east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had gained in altitude from 30 degrees above the horizon at the beginning of the sighting and had risen to approximately 55 degrees from the horizon before disheartening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made several calls asking for people to look for the craft for an attempt to triangulate it&#39;s position they all refused.

Was outside looking at the stars to the south when an object (possibly a fighter jet) was moving north at a very high altitude at high rate of speed (for a jet aircraft) and started to turn toward the east when it was directly above me.  It was at this moment when what i initially thought was a star flashed a brilliant white light at the (jet?).  Had the (jet?) not banked east, this (star?) would have been just about directly in its flight path, and as soon as the light was flashed, the (jet?) banked back around to the west side of the (star?) and as it was going by it what looked to me like a weapon of some sort was fired from the (jet?) at the (star?) with no effect, then the (jet?) just continued north. The (star?) it still just sitting out there…<n>

It started off dim and then got brighter but unlike a shooting star which fades fast it kept getting brighter and closer as close as a plane in the nights sky and then slowed down.  It had a reddish amber glow which emenated an aura around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved irradically up and down and diagonal then before I could call my wife out to see it, it shot across the horizon as fast as a shooting star and then disappeared without a noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen a plane move like that before and the direction and speed of travel was out of this world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shocked so I sat outside to perhaps see it again and I did see a star which started to move like a sattelite but was much brighter.  It was super bright and moved very slow across the night sky from the point of the big dipper East towards the mountains.  This was different than what I had seen earlier but still pretty cool.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed to get brighter and brighter filling the night sky and then dimmed fast and out of sight.  Not that It was past the horizon to where I couldnt see it any longer because when it had dimmed it was right above me.  Very strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess I need to focus on the stars more often because you can see crazy stuff.  I notice that more and more u.f.o sightings are happening more regularly I wonder if 2012 end of the world hooplah has something to do with more and more u.f.o sightings.  I guess I won&#39;t know until 2013.<n>
6/25/11 22:35|Fontana|CA|Other|3-4 mins.|06/25/2011 A brief sighting of what appeared to be an offset horse shoe with 2 bright white lights.|7/4/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81965.html|93|ndxe201106| 06/25/2011 A brief sighting of what appeared to be an offset horse shoe with 2 bright white lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was heading east on my way to work that nite.  I had been scanning the skies for the past few nites looking for sattelites.  As I approached a stop light I looked to my left, (south), when I noticed  an unusually bright light fairly low in the sky.  It really caught my attention beacuse it was so bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it to be a passenger jet due to the fact that we are within miles of an intrenantional air port..  But the color of the light was quite different from other air craft that were traveling through the skies at that time...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second thought was that it must have been a hellicopter with its search light on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it for a few seconds, I noticed that it was moving rather quickly across the sky heading in a north eastern direction.  I began to think, &#34;What is that?????&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i continued to watch it, I noticed that there were no other blinking lights around the main light.  Not only that, the color of the light was bright soft white and the center had a bluish tint to it.  It resembled the hue of a halogen head light on a car, but much more intense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I noticed hat there were 2 lights on the object, one apparently in the front, and one in the back.  Both had the same type of glow, but the 1 in the back seemed less intense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took notice that there were still a lack of any other blinking lights to show me that it was a typical air craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched it traveling across the sky, it appeared to be traveling closer to where I was on the road.  The 2 lights were not even in thier alighnment but they seemed to be part of the same craft, due to the flow of the flight pattern.  The rear light (the dimmer of thye 2) was a bit higher than the front (brighter) light.  Looking at the way the lights were slightly off set, I thought it to be sort of a horse shoe- offset squarish shape.  The lights being on the bottom front and rear feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, the way it was fluently and very quickly cutting through the sky was what really caught my attention.  It cut across the sky traveling both easten and northern simultaneously.  It was like it didn&#39;t need to turn or change any direction in order to travel in in a direction.  It was like it was able to cut across the sky and not have to steer.  It flew faster than any other craft that I have ever seen. It was almost like it wasn&#39;t propelled by a fuel type of means.  It was too perfect and fast.  It seemed silent, almost as if it were skimming across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued to cut across from the south western sky into the south east, I really took notice of the lights.  The intensity and the brightness.  I could see a very thin and vague trace of a beam that came from the rear light and pointed at an angle to the rear and slightly downward.  It quickly made its way across my view heading northerly with a hint of an easterly direction.  As if it could go both directions at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to notice that it seemed to be losing altitude as it glided tword the mountains.  I quickly decided to try and track it as the light changed. I quickly decided to make a right and head north to attempt to track it.   As I approached the next signal light I could tell that it actually semmed to be descending tword the base of the mountain range.  I saw it come down to wher the mountains actually shallow out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is when I lost sight of it.  I continued to search  it out, but by the time I got out of the buildings that covered its decent, It was gone.  I went to a gas station where I could get  good view of the exact area where I saw it descend.  But there was nothing. I figured someone else had to have seen the same thing.  There were quite a few cars out on the road for that time of nite.<n>

I have lasek vision so i can see perfect.  im also very good at judging distances. the main reason i dont think its human craft is because theres no way anyone could withstand accelerating that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

6/25/11 22:30|Gastonia|NC|Light|2-3 min|Saw 2 low flying objects with bright lights, no noise..|6/27/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81937.html|95|ndxe201106| Saw 2 low flying objects with bright lights ,no noise..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 10:30 the night of June 25, 2011, my husband and I both noticed what at first looked like 1 light as it got closer you could tell it was 2 (low enough to tell they had some sort of shape to them, but too bright causing almost a sort of shadowing so couldn&#39;t make the shape out) that were not blinking and were EXTREMELY low right around cloud level.  There were several airplanes headed toward the airport which is only 10 miles from us) and these lights appeared much lower and slower in speed and the lights were moving independently of each other at first, but continuesly circling around each other yet maintaining a straight consistent travel pattern.  As they passed over our house the lights moved even closer together and were in such synch with each other in movement.  For some reason the movement reminded me of a boomerang pattern.  (My husband doesn&#39;t agree about the boomerang thing so I guess its all in perception). I still cannot believe what we saw and it was most definitely not a plane, helicopter, balloon or shooting star.  Also, they made no noise which was odd being as low as they were.(Id say as low as youd normally see a helicopter) We called around and found no information which is odd being that the air control monitors so closely and this being so close to Charlotte Douglas Airport and being so low. Looking on google at last night&#39;s date, I was able to find many articles and pictures from other people all over the country, but so far none locally.  Someone HAD to see it.  There were several planes coming in and it was a relatively clear night..  It was just so odd. It is hard to put into words because it truly was something I have never seen.  Also the lights appeared white or soft yellow<n>

At the time my son spotted it, it looked like it was stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We quickly pulled down a side road to get a closer look, to the beach to get out and get a better view.  We got to a road closest to the beach and spotted it now above land  looking west at a stand still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It started moving at a steady pace moving south west at an angle in the sky.  It was under the cloud cover.  It then disappeared behind the clouds and we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  It was very large and bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It happend around 10:00 pm, just before complete dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were very excited and scared all at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We knew we were lucky to see something that could be a once in a lifetime chance.

They were moving in a linear fashion, and although some distance apart seemed to be following each other in formation and moving in a north/northeast direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I though it must be a series of airplanes moving towards Charlotte airport, but it quickly became apparent that these were not airplanes.  There was no sound, and the burning glow these things generated bore no resemblance to airplane lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sight was so unusual that I pulled over to the shoulder and got out of the car to watch.  These objects looked like a series of large orange streetlights moving across the sky, and there was a fire-like quality to them.  As each moved overhead, it would suddenly get smaller, shrink to pin-point size and vanish completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the most unusual (and unnatural) thing I’ve ever seen, and somewhat unsettling.  It probably took the better part of two minutes for them all to pass overhead and disappear.  This was very real, and it will be on my mind for a while.<n>

6/25/11 21:45|North Muskegon|MI|Light|4 Minutes|Two orange lights spotted one after the other over Muskegon Michigan|7/4/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81948.html|99|ndxe201106| Two orange lights spotted one after the other over Muskegon Michigan<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a posting to NUFORC regarding 2 orange lights spotted in the evening sky over Muskegon, Michigan.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was approximately 9:45 PM in the evening.  My brother-in-law and niece were with me.  We had just finished extinguishing a campfire down his hill on Bear Lake and just brought our supplies into the house.  We needed to pick up a few things outside so all three of us proceeded out to the front of the house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when I noticed a orange light in the night sky.  (It was a dark orange color but bight in appearance)  From our position it was west/southwest of us somewhere just north of the Muskegon channel that connects Muskegon Lake to Lake Michigan.  It was moving in an easterly direction at a slow but steady pace.  There were no blinking lights on it.  I watched it closely and only noticed a slight variation in the overall luminosity of the object.  I wouldn’t call it a steady pulse, but there was a constant change (ever so slightly) in it’s brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called out to my brother-in -law and niece who were only 10 feet away.  I asked them what that light was.  They both watched it with me for a good 30 seconds.  We all agreed that there were no blinking lights (as you would see on an airplane), there was no sound from the object and it was like nothing any of us had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the initial 30 seconds the orange object changed directions heading in a south/southeasterly direction and even appeared to rise up slightly.  After about 10 seconds it disappeared.  There were a few clouds in the night sky and it was hard to tell if this first light vanished or went behind a cloud.  It was too dark to see the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three of us continued to look for the object for a few seconds and then immediately began talking about what we had just seen.  After about 30 - 60 seconds... to our surprise a second bright orange light appeared very close to where the first orange light had originally appeared in the night sky.  My niece ran inside and told other family members to come outside and see the object.  My wife, sister-in-law and 2 other children came out.  They all watched the object with us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This second orange object/light followed a similar path but did extend its easterly path a bit further than the first light.  It held this course for about 50 - 60 seconds also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then turned to a south/southeast coarse for roughly 10-15 seconds and then disappeared.  None of the family members had ever seen any lights like these in the area or their lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife is a true skeptic of UFO’s and aliens and was willing to acknowledge to me that it was some sort of a unidentified flying object.  That admission is about as good as I’m going to get out of her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Points discussed after the sighting:  Did we see 2 objects or 1 object that circled around and reappeared in the same location.  The group decided that (if the first object maintained the same speed) that it was to far for it to return to the original location and reappear in the amount of time that had transpired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Muskegon County Airport runways, located to the south of the sighting, do not line up with the objects coarse/direction.  The objects never appeared to be coming down to land or taking off from the ground.  Although it is hard to determine the 2 objects exact elevation, I would estimate them to have been between 5,000 feet - 10,000 feet in the air.  All of us see planes in the air (at lower elevations) around Muskegon every day and night.  We also see planes way up in the sky traveling at 25,000 feet to 30,000 feet traveling across the country.  All of us agreed... these 2 objects weren’t planes.  They were like nothing we had ever seen.<n>

Spotted two orange colored lights coming down from the southwest just at sunset.  Sky was with some overcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thought at first it was two small aircraft, but heard no sound. Third object came into view behind the two from same direction.  Looked like they were sky divers slowly coming down and it looked like they were on fire with the bright orange glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my neighbor out to see what he thought.  I really got excited when two or three more came from the same height and direction. all glowing orange color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first three were now slowly going up instead of coming down heading Northwest.  The glowing colors seemed to go out and all we could see was tiny small black objects in the sunset going higher and higher.  Sky Divers don&#39;t go up they come down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All objects seemed to follow the others out of sight towards Eagle Wisconsin.<n>

When visible it had a steady light.  It was seen from Yakima about 15 degrees above the horizon slightly toward the North Northwest.  I pointed it out to a neighbor lady who also saw it.<n>

It started out just seeing crazy lights in the sky and as months go by they would come closer and closer and different shapes of crafts crazy lights as one i really remember is one that was shaped like a Hersey Kiss w/ a red triangle in front and bright green lights on the side of it these flew as high as above houses and slides across the streets.Several months of craziness I&#39;ve video recorded several events as best as a beginner could.It&#39;s whats been going on lately that&#39;s got me all these ORBS everywhere w/faces orbs that change shapes i never seen before and they are in trees above houses. I have lots of videos to show you much better than my words.As for the crafts i still them in the sky but nothing like the orbs that is a daily thing also it&#39;s just crazier since they are on the ground and just explainable.I wish i could find the people to come investigate this sh*t.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
6/25/11 01:00|Stanley|ID|Light|20 minutes|3 alternating color, fast moving lights over Stanley Lake in Stanley, Idaho.|7/4/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81958.html|104|ndxe201106| 3 alternating color, fast moving lights over Stanley Lake in Stanley, Idaho.<n> <n><n> <n><n> June 25th, 2011, found myself and my brother sitting around a campfire near Stanley Lake, in beautiful Stanley, Idaho.  My brother had camped in the area for many years but it was my first time staying in the area.  We recounted old stories and watched the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we viewed the night sky my brother whispered, &#34;Do you see that?&#34;   And as I followed his finger I saw what he was asking about.   At first it looked like a star but it flashed orange, red, yellow and a lime green color.  I&#39;ve seen stars that flash colors but have always known them to be satellites or far off aircraft; this particular star moved in zig-zagging motions.  It zipped in a &#34; Z&#34;-like pattern, very quickly, then vanished below the tree line and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We continued watching the night sky and then saw two more &#34;stars&#34; flying in the same pattern and flashing the same colors.  We were not under the influence of alcohol, or any other substance, but seeing those strange objects made us feel like we were because it just felt so strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother is a college student and I&#39;m a recent college graduate.  We both heavily enjoy outdoor activities and have never seen anything remotely UFO-ish until just a few days ago.  The pattern they moved in and the speed they moved at is what has me convinced that they weren&#39;t any human made craft.<n>

There were no signs of it being an airplane as it was a constant light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought is that it might be a shooting star, but it had no constant speed and drifted off course several times.  There were three shooting stars shortly after the light was gone, flying in the opposite direction of the object all in the same general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing else was spotted the rest of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was lying down on my chaise star gazing, as I do every clear night, looking northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something large and low suddenly caught my eye to the southwest.  As I was turning my head I thought I was going to see a bird, until my eyes locked onto the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three gray/translucent perfectly equidistant disks connected by lines/bars flew slowly and silently overhead, then completely disappeared before a tree positioned to my left (northeast).  The size of each disk was apparent 1 degree in diameter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mind was quickly running through all of the things it could have been; tethered balloons?  No, flying perfectly aligned together, never breaking formation.  Remote-controlled toy?  No, it was translucent with a dull luminescence and the way it was flying was just too odd and absolutely disappeared in flight.  The only way I can explain its appearance and flight path is as if I was looking at the back end of a vehicle in flight, but couldn&#39;t see the front body of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only was visible for about 5-6 seconds then completely disappeared BEFORE it would&#39;ve gone behind a tree.  I&#39;m really not sure of the height, but it looked about 200-500 feet in the air; hard to tell because of its translucency.  Unfortunately, by the time my son looked up it was already gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been an avid star watcher for a few years, so I know what is normally in the sky.  I know which are satellites, iridium flares, space station, stars, planets, planes, helicopters, etc.  This really was nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My other grown son and couple of his friends have also seen transparent low flying crafts at the height of 200 ft (explains the craft as cigar shaped, transparent as if looking through a heat wave &amp; having 3 gill shaped lights on the underbelly) late at night at our house; 1 last year and 1 about 2 years ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three yrs ago, my grown daughter and her friend were lying on the roof.  They saw an enormous triangular black craft with a white light at each corner (she explains it as about the size of her hand at arm&#39;s length) fly directly, silently over them at approx. 600-1000 ft high.  It scared them so much they were crying hysterically and ran inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My kids and I are truly objective, grounded people who I believe have just seen very unusual things.  I work as an analyst, so it&#39;s my job to be observant, analytical and objective.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would very much like to know if anyone else saw it or have ever seen anything like what I&#39;ve described.  I&#39;ve attached a drawing of what I saw at my perspective lying down on my back; porch overhang to my right/southwest (where I first spotted it), tree to my left/northeast (where it disappeared PRIOR to the tree).  Hope the visual helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for your time.<n>

I quickly realized these were like nothing I had ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As they came over the horizon they glowed a reddish/orange and made a noise like you would here with a jet or a plane.  The noise quickly faded and there were about 12 glowing lights and 3 or so black disc shaped craft flying with them all silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights started to fade out revealing they were all black disc like craft.  The lights would either fade out or dim down to one point on the disc, they all flew in the same direction with no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them closely until they were all out of sight and filmed a few minutes of footage showing the lit ones and you can see 2 of the non-lit ones flying in the bunch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know what I saw but I got this feeling like I was witnessing something not normal, and I have never seen anything like that before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

6/24/11 20:30|Pikeville|KY|Changing|3 minutes|Object seen in sky above Pikeville. Appeared to change shape several times|6/27/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81913.html|113|ndxe201106| Object seen in sky above Pikeville.  Appeared to change shape several times<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were sitting in our car in the parking lot across from RiteAid and Save-A-Lot at the plaza in Pikeville.  Our parents were in Save-A-Lots to buy a few things, while my brother and I sat in the car with our dog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 8:30-8:40 pm, my brother and I witnessed an object in the sky above the section of town around Magic Mart and the Windmill Restaurant.  There are two radio tower-like structures on the hills in this direction, making a football goal formation.  The object remained in this general area throughout the duration of the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be cigar/blimp shaped craft tilted slightly downward.  It produced no trail as a jet should, nor did it have any lights, blinking or stationary.  If I had to guess, I would say that it was maybe a couple hundred feet above the ground, above of the farthest mountain visible from this position. It was only visible because of the sunlight reflecting off of it&#39;s surface.  If it has been any further away that this, it probably wouldn&#39;t have been visible from our position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as it&#39;s size, it was too far away to really be certain.  I would guess that it was not as large as a commercial plane, but not as small as the single-propeller planes commonly flown in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sunlight reflecting from it&#39;s surface gave it a golden color.  It was lit so well that we could really see the shape quite well despite the distance.  So well, that we are certain that there were no wings present on this craft.  The object was about as bright as Polaris/North Star on clear night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved in straight line to the left. My brother noticed it first.  When he initially noticed it, the object was slightly to the right of the &#34;right&#34; radio tower.  It proceeded to move left, passing behind this tower and continuing to the left until it passed by the second tower.  After realizing that wasn&#39;t shaped like any known aircraft, my brother told me to look in that direction.  The object was so bright that it immediately caught my attention.  I viewed it for mere seconds before it passed behind the second &#34;left&#34; tower and proceeded to travel out of sight behind a wooded hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe in extra terrestrial life and UFOs, but I had never saw anything to really solidify my beliefs.  This event really doesn&#39;t help because I can&#39;t rule out that it might have been a distant plane, despite weird shape and behavior.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw it, I thought it might have been a jet, until I saw that it had no wings and did not leave a trail of any sort.  We were both in shock throughout the duration of the sighting, as it just looked so different and wrong compared to anything else we had seen in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Right before I lost sight of it, I got out of the car and walked toward the trunk so I could see the object for a bit longer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 30 seconds or a minute later, the object reappeared going in the opposite direction.  It was slightly higher up this time.  It was still sort of cigar shaped but was now pointed in the direction it was traveling.  Within 5-10 seconds, the shape looked a bit different.  It looked almost as though it was two spheres in line, attached at the equator.  I&#39;m not sure if this was a trick of light or if it actually changed shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued right for about 30 seconds.  At this point, the object appeared to become red or to glow red.  My brother and I both remarked on the odd color change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed it for another 30 seconds or so before I lost sight of it around a cloud.  I then ran to the front seat to retrieve my mother&#39;s cellphone to perhaps get a picture of the object, hoping that it would reveal itself on the other side of this cloud eventually.  I was unable to get any pictures/video of the object, as I had already put the camera away by the time I saw it the final time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I got back to my door of the car and looked back up, the object had disappeared.  I asked my brother where it had gone, when he explained what the object had done in my absence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He claims that he lost it in the cloud as well, but it appeared again shortly afterwards and proceeded to enter a sharp turn.  From this point onward, it was once again gold or yellow in color and its shape was different once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it made the turn, the object turned onto its side enough that he could note the shape.  It appeared to be disc shaped with a ring or separate segment in the bottom of it.  After making this turn, the object was traveling in the same direction as it was when we first discovered it.  It continued in this direction for 5-10 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time I saw it was about a minute later.  The craft was heading downward and away from us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun was setting quickly at this point and apparently the sun had sunk so low below the mountains that its light no longer reflected on the object&#39;s surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stood outside the car for several more minutes trying to catch another glimpse of it, but it was not seen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should note that about 8 minutes after the event, a small plane flew overhead and headed in the direction of the previous craft.  It was shocking seeing how different these two craft were.  Even as the plane became so far away that that it was barely visible, you could still see its wings and it was obviously no where near as reflective as the previous object.<n>

And a great big sign that say&#39;s &#34;Last Chance Before Area 51&#34; theres a big sign with some kind of alien smilling on it. I passed that...<n> <n><n> <n><n> An ...things just did&#39;nt make sence any more. Oh the raido was still on. I could here drivers helping moter homes to pass. But              somthing changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no more traffic. I was all alone. Hell who am I to complain... Then I saw a stealth hilocopter,just off my driver side window. about 50 feet off the ground.Hell I laughted through them a wave, just a couple of our boys have&#39;n a little fun. You know military messin with with the drivers. But there was somthin worng.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked again,they were gone.I drove a little while longer.And they reapered on my passenger side in the same stealth hillocoper.But this time I could see It... It it was not a hellocoper at all it was the image of a hello being projected on some other type of craft. The sun was setting about 10 oclock and the small ship could not manifest the strenght of the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a big man. Yet I sit in sweat.and fear. I am Afraid to go outside my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I dont know how. The next thing I knew I was stoped.You just dont stop a semi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I was stopped never the less.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the side of the road.Now Im makeing a sandwitch.I was angry cause I was getting bread crumbs on the floor.But I had no bread.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up and I saw great fire works in the sky. I could here some kind of bleed over on my am/cb raido.sounded like,Have you ever picked the phone while on the inter net? but a gazillon times faster. My mind was taken.I thought,Hey you know they have those burning man festivals out here maby thats what it was. But the fire works were on a like a tv screen. Ya My mind wAS taken. So now Im putting mayo on my sandwitch. ahhhhhh. Im a Mirical whip kind of person. I looked up again I was fighting. Fighting, and I saw it.It was a city size ship about 3.5 miles thick in the center about 1 mile thick around the edge. It looked like a jiant sized cookie, with a 747 airplain wing stuck on the back end of it.A tail wing. I realized I was not seeing fire works.but a gient picture being projected on the ships skin. This ship could be 500 feet above your feet and all you would see is birds clouds or at night stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It disappered over a foot hill heading north.The next thing I knew.All of sudden I was driving again like I never stopped. And there was no sandwitch. Good thing I would not have eatin it any way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Boy I was furious I slamed on the breakes and this time pulled over. I felt as if I was mind raped.Then this feeling came over me. As If someone was talking to me but I could not see.They said this was to keep me safe. I was hauling hasmat and I could not pass under the ship. It was to keep me safe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of the truck and ran and ran now the sun was just set chaseing after the ship. Daddy. I got to the top of the foot hill my tracks are still there this day and I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They lied. There was a problem with there clocking device. I saw the city ship it looked liked it had a big flat screen tv wraped arournd it. A greyish dule kind of color.With milions of little bubbles on the skin. for 3d my gess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw 4 sawser ships and two sigar ships to the right. They all seemed to be sitting on some type of mat. The mat was mabey a 16 mile cover up layed out on the bed of a dry lake.it looked like the same material that covered the ships.I saw buildings and they were all covered with the same material.There were people running around yelling.Some type of german/asturin I dont know.Germin Id say but I dont know Germin. They had on what looked like pajamas,Bagie. The same kind of material,but baggie. They had on what looked like tankes on there backes like scuba but for land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And they had on big goggles.they were running around yelling.the whole thing kept fazzing in and out.Then It all just dissapeared.I knew they knew I was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to my truck,I lost 2 hrs 36 that day. and have no prof,of anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> evey thing has been fixed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I herd the host of this site talking on a raido show. he said nobody ever reports.

However, although the weather was extremely unsettled, a mix of storm-clouds and sunshine, the cube did not appear to move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The surface of the cube appeared very smooth almost like it was coated with vinyl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, there was no shine or reflection off the surface of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was stationary, at the edge of some storm clouds, and it seemed likely they would shortly close around it.  I had to watch my driving and quickly lost sight of the object, because the highway swung so that the object was now directly behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total time of the sighting was probably 10-15 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because the storm clouds had edged around the object, I know it was in the sky and not an outdoor light fixture, etc., giving the appearance of an object.  It was also like nothing I had ever seen, or expected to see. This is my first unknown sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 64 years old, in good health and not seeking publicity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would be interested in knowing if anyone else in Northwestern Washington State observed anything similar to this.<n>

There was only one break in the clouds in the shape like an open eye. I noticed a huge object seem to float across this opening in the cloudy sky.  This object was at least five times bigger then any aircraft I have ever seen.  The shape was unlike any ufo I ever heard of.  It had a top,middle and bottom to it.  All the same width with the middle a bit larger in highth then the top and bottom.  The top and bottom were the same sizes. middle section was like the saucer shapes you here of, but there were like half saucers on top and bottom of it.  Seemed flat on top and bottom. It just glided through the opening in the clouds for a few seconds and that was it. seemed to be made of medal, not shinny though just a dull look to it.  No lights, no sounds, no signs of combustion. just glided like it was sliding on the gravy some how.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I really don&#39;t know where else to report this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like the whole sky took a picture, for what seemed like seconds there were two sets of flashes with a pause between the two.  The friend I was on the phone with was a former Navy so I asked him if he knew of any reports of storms or other things in the area that might have caused this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After 15 or 20 minutes discussing what I had seen, he had said that he checked and that there were no storms in the area at all, not even clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound or bolts of lightning, nothing on the radar, just looked like someone with a really huge planet sized camera took a picture of our planet with flash.  Sorry for that description but that is the best I can describe it.  It was just the two sets and that was it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flash was blueish white and looked exactly like a camera flash in a really dark room but much much quicker.<n>

Since I wear a CPAP machine at night I thought the machine was finally going out om completely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of bed and noticed that after turning the machine offf I could still hear and feel the humming, vibrating sound.  My wife who had slept in the living room with the tv on I went and woke her up thinking that it was the tv, but I could hear the sound much louder in the living room.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned and looked toward the back door which has a glass on it and a paper thin door blind all the way down.  I could see a pulsing red light between the edge of the blind and the glass door.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately went out to the backporch without turning my outside spotlights.  To the left side of our property is a big stonewall and the state is building the new 183A Toll Road.  To the back and south of the property is a wooded creek.  I thought that the road crew was working late again because they have worked on weekends before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stepped out to the porch and to my left I saw some type of craft.  It had to be a flying craft but I was unable to see what type of design it was because to the back of the craft were three (3) large in sequence pulsating lights lights.  The light were in sequence from left to right.  The red lights eminating from the flying craft were very bright and big and I was unable to distinguish the the type of craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was flying south just above treetop level and approximately 45/50 miles and hour.  I spent 20 years in the Air Force and I know no aircraft in the Air Force had huge red pulsating lights on the back like the ones I saw.  I&#39;m also retired from the police department.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object disappeared behind the trees still going southbound on highway 183A toward Austin, Texas.  Other people had to have seen something because light traffic was traveling in both directions at the time.<n>

Then whilst we both watched it shrank instantly to half the size and then very slowly started to lower over the valley.

Lewis/North Fort exit we saw 2 more.  This time it was really close, no more than a mile away and still from what seemed like the same altitude.  I was driving at the time so I told my wife to look up and see if there were any planes or helicopters in the area above us and she saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We got home and told our story, and my brother in law and nephew saw the same thing except from the driveway of our house, but in the direction of JBLM.  They said they saw between 8 and 11 lights dropping from the same general area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know for a fact that these weren’t flares because I’ve seen flares being dropped before.  It seriously looked like red shooting stars that only lit up a few hundred feet off the ground before hitting the ground.  It’s really hard to describe these lights but the only way I really describe it is like red traffic lights, lighting up a few hundred feet off the ground already travelling at a high rate of speed downwards before hitting the ground.  No smoke trail and no reflecting light off the landscape where these objects fell.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In all honesty, I don’t think these were anything “out of this world”, but these were really strange and I’m posting only because I know it wasn’t only us that saw these lights and hopefully somebody else who saw them reads this with an answer to what these were.<n>

I wondered where such a thing could originate in this Valley.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very bright, like it was on fire on the bottom.  The fiery light did not appear to be flames burning out of control, but clearly contained within some sort of consruct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It resembled a balloon from  my vantage point. The top appeared dark and solid and emitted no light, the bottom appeared as bright as a very high heat fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It ascended in an eventual wide arc, yet climbed up until it appeared to either flicker out, or disappear completely.  Either way, it was no longer visible after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not too long after, what appeared to be normal commercial aircraft flew in the usual pattern overhead as though bound for area airports.  They were easy to identify because of the typical lights.  I wondered if they had seen anything out of the ordinary too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think my neighbors may have seen it too.<n>

One of us had just went inside when I spotted what I thought to be two airplanes and alerted my friend, my friend and I are both pilots so of course they drew our interest.  We almost instantly knew they were unusual we both decided they were flying at about 3 TO 5 thousand feet and at somewhere between 2 and 3 hundred miles per hour.  They appeared to be the shape of an upside down coffee cup but quite frankly it was difficult to tell because of darkness and a bright light on the bottom front, but we all agreed thats what we saw.  We were so excited by what we saw we hollered for the one who went inside to come out, we wanted her to witness to this also.  They were going in a southwesterly direction staggarded in 2-3-1-1 without formation.  We discussed it for awhile and all agreed we had seen something unusual.  There were seven unusual aircraft relatively close going at a high rate of speed and we could not hear them.  Shortly after they passed the local air ambulance rose an seemed in slow motion in comparison.<n>

We both saw lights about 1 mile in the distance in a cluster shape or formation, seeming yellow at first.  These lights would disapear and the reapear on the other side of the formation.  These &#34;transports&#34; happened at least 4 times. It was slowly moving in our direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as they got closer, but still at least a half mile away, most of the lights seemed to disappear and then only three remained.  It was a triangle with a red blinking light at the top and two solid yellow lights at the bottom.  It hovered in the air, not moving, for at least 3 minutes as we watched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then it began to seem to sway back and forth once or twice then began moving to the lower right of the tree line.  Before it was out of site it slowly changed direction and went to the lower right instead.  Not moving straight, like any regular aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was hardly visible as it moved through the trees until out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several minutes later the same object or an identical one went to the same exact spot in the sky and stayed hovering for the same duration of time before following the path the other took.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.

I got to the Baseball field across the street and took a breather before turning back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Sun peaking thru the clouds looked inspirational so I took a picture of it.  I was going to post a picture on a Blog with inspirational wording.  I am a Personal Trainer and try to get people out and moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned home without looking at the picture.  When I cam home I brought the picture up to show the wife how pretty the Sun looked.  It was then I had seen this Red oval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I showed the wife and said it had to be the moon or something reflecting from the Sun.  She said the moon doesn’t sit behind the Sun at Sun-Rise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought true so posted it on F.B to get Corkey comments.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I go to school this girl that sits next to me zoomed in on it and had this look on her ace like OMG show others.

I would call the color yellow, but it seemed to be a little more faded than a true yellow.  It seemed to have manifested out of nothing and traveled, from my perspective, what seemed like in inches.  Then disappeared as quickly as it appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was round, but only in the sense that light is &#34;round.&#34;  It had a sort of light around it too, but it could have just been me seeing the light from whatever I saw shining around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking out the window, it was in the northeastern part of the sky.  It seemed to be a bit closer to me than a plane would be and it was brighter.  The light was not flashing.  It also seemed to traveling faster.  But I can’t be totally sure, I keep slowing the event down in my mind to try to understand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What truly irked me about this was that earlier in the night, I saw a shooting star.  It was quite dim, and was traveling horizontally to the horizon in the western sky.  And the night before last I went out to my car to get my cell phone and I saw a shooting star then.  But it seemed very close and very bright.  But this light was more of a white-blue color.  And it traveled down in the western sky. I think it was only in the sky for a few seconds, but it went behind trees.  It was still bright enough to see through the tops of trees but I can’t be sure how long it was actually there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am 19 years old.  I have always believed in life beyond our planet.  But I had never seen evidence of it. I do not get paranoid.  I do not subscribe to conspiracy theories.  I am very skeptical about most things.  I think I have a pretty good head on my shoulders, but this really scared me.  I’m still very confused by it.  I just want to know what I saw.<n>

I am guessing it was between 5 and 10 miles from my location.  At first I thought it was some sort of flare, but then it exploded and shot out red sparks without making a sound.  At this point the sparks faded, but a single solid red light remained which slowly began to move vertically like an airplane southeast towards the Virginia Beach Coast.  I watched it for about 5 minutes when without notice it dissapeared.  There was no fading, dimming or blinking at any time of any sort.  The red light just immediatley went out.  From what I could tell in the darkness there was no contrail on the object before or after it split apart, and it made no sound. I cannot imagine how anyone on the Bay Bridge Tunnel could not have seen t! his, but I have not been able to find another report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

6/21/11 23:00|Vacaville|CA|Light|2 mintues|Moving star like object, fading in and out, and moving different directions.  ((NUFORC Note:  Could not have been the ISS.  PD))|7/4/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81992.html|136|ndxe201106| Moving star like object, fading in and out, and moving different directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the last few months, me and my father have been watching the night sky over Vacaville, CA, looking for the &#34;orange lights/Fireballs&#34; that have been largely reported over the last year or so.  I&#39;ve still never witnessed them myself (my father did while on business in Charleston, SC, last month), but I did see something interesting this night.  On June 21st I began looking up at the sky at roughly 10 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes before 11 PM, (I know it was slightly before 11 because of the TV program on in My garage) as I was looking towards the East above my house, I noticed what appeared to be a quite bright star or satellite, moving from South to North, at a slightly faster speed than the satellites I see often.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Naturally, I assumed this was a satellite because it appeared to be so far away and had just one solid light (Looked just like a star), but I just kept watching it anyways, as I wasn&#39;t even seeing airplanes this night (Which is pretty odd because I live minutes from the Vacaville private Airport, and only 12 miles from Travis AFB.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 20 seconds, the light began to slowly fade and was about to be blocked from my view by trees in my front yard.  So I moved to the side of my house (which faces South) and continued to watch it move North until it completely faded away.  It took roughly 15 seconds for it to go from fading to completely invisible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t think much of it at first because I know satellites and debris can reflect the sun and create this &#34;fading light&#34; effect, but after about 10 seconds the light reappeared almost in the exact same spot it became invisible, this time moving in the complete opposite direction (North to South).  It moved completely the same, in a straight line and at the same slightly faster than a satellite speed.  The fade-in to visibility was much quicker than the fade-out, maybe 5 seconds till it appeared as bright as it was the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I moved to the center of my driveway at this time, still facing East looking over my house.  Then it faded away completely again, only being visible this time for roughly 20 seconds, including the fade time, which was much quicker than the first time (it took only about 6-8 seconds).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking in the same area where it disappeared this time (which was directly above my house, about half the distance from where it originated), still facing East, when it reappeared yet a third Time, this time moving either up or West/slightly north (It was hard to tell because of how high it was in My view).  It continued moving the same as previously, and was visible for about the same amount of Time as the second time before fading away completely.  This all happened under 2 minutes.  I figured it would continue to do this (or hoped I should say), so I ran into my house from the drive way through the Garage to get my Father.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran out into the center of the driveway and looked East at the area where I had just seen it 2 minutes earlier, but did not see anything.  Then about 12 minutes later, my dad spotted it directly above our heads, moving from East to West in the same manner as before, short fade in to a longer fade out. It was longer visible after about 20 seconds.  I looked at my phone for time, and it was 11:14 PM.  We continued to search for about an hour, then we gave up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole thing has really got me interested in finding out what me and my father saw.  If there is a good explanation, I would really like to hear it, or if anyone else saw this or has seen this in the Solano County Area, I would also really like to know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Could not have been the ISS; it was not visible at the time indicated above, and on the date indicate.

All six of us were standing on this tall bridges Cat walk when i looked up across the river and noticed the spherical object hovering over the mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yea i knew what it was as soon as i seen it. It actually shocked me and made me feel as if i was dreaming it up.  But no i yelled look and i pointed at the object but knowone looked because they thought i was being silly, but my friend that trust me looks up and sees the object hovering as well. Then everyone turned and looked and seen the object but as everyone started to notice the craft it started to shrink. The object to our point of view was about the size of a dime if u held it out infront of you. It must havea taken off at Not-Of-This-Earth like Speed. until it got so far away you couldnt see it anymore.<n>

Zooming in on the photos they appear to be small shining orbs or motes of light.

The blinking was irregular, and the colors were intense.  It appeared oval or round in shape and the lights seemed to form around its shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved slowly in different directions, but mostly stood still.  It was 6-7 miles away, and probably 3-4 miles off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for about 1/2 hour until it became obscured by clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was located at about the midway point of Loon Lake, just over the northeast side of Highway 395.  It was not above the lake, but was about 1-2 miles off to the northeast side.<n>

However it moved, looked, and sounded like nothing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a triangular craft, I first noticed it driving to work, ( I work third shift ) it looked from the side like a helicopter.  It had a spotlight coming out the front, like it was concentrated on something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO was stationary in the air and made no noise like a helicopter would, there were no propellers chopping it was just sitting still in the air.  The UFO was really close to my parking lot at work, which is really close to a runway at the airport nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got closer to the parking lot at work I could see the UFO better.  I got a glimpse of the craft from underneath it, it was triangular in shape almost like a stealth bomber.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of my car, and heard the UFO make absolutely no sound, it started to turn at a 45 degree angle and faded away out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO had a light on each point and was very clearly a triangle.  It remained still, until it just started moving with no sign of an engine or propellers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was near an airport, so it could be just a regular aircraft, but like I said before, it was very different from anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

West, bog and mountains in distance, can see camp lights from western mountains on clear nights.  South West, bog, South - unoccupied camp, forest, the mountain tapers down on south side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sounds:  insects, frogs, coyotes, moose, fish jumping, beavers;  what you would expect to hear in the deep country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First of all I don&#39;t drink or use drugs when I fish, I am most always alone and like to fish at night.  I need to be safe if I am to have fun.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was fly fishing a semi-remote carry in canoe access pond on the border of Sebago and Naples line.  It was a warm, clear, windless night mostly quiet aside from fish, frogs and other animals, no cars in the distance or sounds aside from that of nature.  It was so clear and bright from moon/star light that I didn&#39;t need to wear my head lamp.  It was warm, still in the 70&#39;s.  The only human structures were a single very small camp (unoccupied for years) and a radio tower with a blinking strobe, roughly 1 mile away and very distant camp on western mountain top whose lights you saw now and again in the distance.  I don&#39;t know exact time, but it was between 10-12 pm.  The pond is small, shallow and remote.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the middle of paddling from one side of the pond, to the other going south west when a light appeared in the sky to the north.  It was about four times as luminous and larger than the north star.  It looked a ball of light.  It appeared to be very high in the sky, much higher than prop planes and military/jets that occasionally fly over, but I don&#39;t really know how high or large object was.  It made no sound.  The speed at which it moved seemed slow compared to shooting stars that I see frequently at this spot.  I thought that&#39;s what it was but it became obvious that the speed of the object was slowing down and wasn&#39;t a shooting star. It came to an immediate, abrupt and obvious stop mid point in the sky, nearly on top of my position. stayed in that spot 5 or 6 seconds and it disappeared.  The light was white/blue, it was a hot blue - it was strange I remember it was constantly bright but looked like electric fire of &#34;flashes&#34; of blue and white light, but not strobe like I guess the closest thing I can say is the light &#34;flowed&#34;  I don&#39;t know if that makes sense, but that&#39;s what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stopped and sat there in the canoe for several minutes - kept fishing for a little while, but felt like I needed to get home.  My girlfriend didn&#39;t know what to say about it, she looked horrified, she was speechless.  As I told her I was overwhelmed with emotion.  I guess it didn&#39;t register at the moment that I saw something so bizarre that I couldn&#39;t explain it.  Since then I haven&#39;t told anyone else what I saw.  It makes me anxious to think about it, let alone tell people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It was about a half mile away, high above the tree tops and moving from west to east across the sky.  It was approximately 6 to 7:15 p.m. on Monday, June 20, and happened in Lafayette, Colorado.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no noise and was the color of steel.  When I first saw it, I thought it was a plane since it was moving through the sky, but I definitely saw the rounded right side of it, so I was confused about its identity.  I took a photo of it with my camera using the telephoto, and then continued to watch it cross the sky until it was no longer in my sight.  It moved in a straight horizontal pattern and did not dart around.  Its speed was similar to our airplanes.  Since I was not even thinking about UFOs, but merely taking photos of clouds, the sighting caught me off guard; I was bewildered or I would have taken more photos as it moved off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in an area next to a golf course.  No one was with me.  Since it was a while before I saw someone, and other things started being discussed, I forgot about what had happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A week ago, I finally had a chance to check my memory stick from my digital camera, and there was the photo I had taken!  I was so surprised to be seeing it clearly for the first time.  (My camera doesn’t have a small viewer, and it’s often difficult to see the topic of the photo on the large screen. Also, I do not see details well if things are far away.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired reading specialist who taught at the elementary level for thirty years, as well as taught as a consultant in two university settings.

For some reason the movement reminded me of a boomerang pattern. (My husband doesn&#39;t agree about the boomerang thing so I guess its all in perception).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still cannot believe what we saw and it was most definitely not a plane, helicopter, balloon or shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, they made no noise that we cold hear even being as low as they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called around and found no information which is odd being that the air control monitors so closely and this is so close to Charlotte Douglas Airport and the &#34;whatever the heck it was&#34; being so low.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Looking on google at that  date, I was able to find many articles and pictures from other people all over the country, but so far none locally....<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another site I contacted later emailed me and said he had been called by someone that night about 10 miles from us and they reported seeing it as well  Someone else HAD to see it.  There were several planes coming in and it was a relatively clear night… It was just so odd.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is hard to put into words because it truly was something I have never seen.  Also the lights appeared white or soft yellow and not blue or red like I have seen some people mention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it went over us my husband and I both could only stand there in the middle of our yard pointing with our mouths wide open is disbelief...  I honestly STILL can’t wrap my mind around it...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never been a disbeliever (actually I’ve never had an opinion either way), but I NEVER thought WE would be those people who saw one...whatever it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friends keep joking telling me its swamp gas or a weather balloon...  It was by NO means any type of balloon.  It was flying, albeit gracefully, but not floating... We both keep saying we can’t believe how low it actually was...  I can only guess it/they (cause it appeared 2 be 2 at some point) was only traveling about 35 -50 mph at the point we saw it.  We watched until the trees hid it from our view.<n>
6/19/11 23:45|Parsippany|NJ|Other|3 minutes|A hazy wave-shaped, orange and yellow light with a sharply defined white orb hovering bellow it in the skies of NJ|7/4/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81952.html|157|ndxe201106| A hazy wave-shaped, orange and yellow light with a sharply defined white orb hovering bellow it in the skies of NJ<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 11:45 when my mother and I stepped out of the Clearview Cinemas in Parsippany, New Jersey.  We had just seen the new Woody Allen movie and were talking about what a fun movie it was, when I saw something strange in the sky at 12 o’clock in front of us which would have been to the east.  It was this strange glowing light in the middle of a noticeably dark night sky.  This bright yellow and orange light had a wave-like shape, curving upward in the center and hazily fading out at its sides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, my mind tried to search for possible explanations.  I first looked behind me to see if it could be a reflection of something off the clouds, like the moon perhaps.  But I could not find anything that would make sense to give it that color or shape.  Then I thought it might be a radio tower or street lamp (It seemed, at first, to be close enough to the ground for these options to be feasible), but the light was too bright and big to be either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I pointed the object out to my mom to see what she could come up with.  And that’s when the strangest thing happened;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out from the bottom right of the object appeared a small, highly-defined white orb that just seemed to hover beneath the larger, foggy light.  The contrast between the haziness of the yellow and orange light and the sharpness of the defined white orb was incredible, and perplexing.  The orb hovered very slowly, and free-flowingly from the bottom right side of the larger light fixture to the bottom left of it, treaded there a moment, then freely moved to the center, bellow the &#34;crest&#34; of the wave-like object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After staying there a bit it, it then moved to the bottom left again and seemed to go behind the larger light- only to reappear a few moments later at the top right of the &#34;wave&#34; light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, my mother and I had concluded that it could not have been a plane.  The object did not make any noise and the movement was to free and loose- almost as though it were swimming.  And all of a sudden, as if I just knew (and I did, I just felt like I knew), I told my mother, &#34;Watch, it’s gonna disappear.  Watch it disappear.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sure enough, a few beats later, the object began to disappear very slowly, from the outside in.  And, poof, gone.  There was nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother and I tried all night to figure out some sort of explanation to stray away of the conclusion of a UFO, but after talking about all sorts of possibilities, we concluded that there was nothing on earth that either of us had seen in our lifetimes that looked or even resembled what we saw that night in the sky that night.  And even the way that orb was moving- there’s nothing in our technology that could allow us to control a craft in that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t believe I wasn&#39;t the only one to see this.  There were two of us. And after separately (in different rooms) drawing out what we had seen, we confirmed that what we saw that night was exactly the same thing, and it was unlike anything else our eyes had ever witnessed.<n>
6/19/11 23:45|Parsippany|NJ|Other|1 minute|A boomerang-shaped object with yellow, orange, red lights, the size of a baseball field, hovered in sky with  white orb moving around.|6/27/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81936.html|158|ndxe201106| A boomerang-shaped object with yellow, orange, red lights, the size of a baseball field, hovered in sky with  white orb moving around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO Sighting Report  	My 18-year-old daughter and I left the movie theatre and walked out into the parking lot on Sunday night, June 19, 2011, in Parsippany, NJ, at 11:45 pm.  The night was exceptionally black, no moon or stars, and there appeared to be high cloud cover but it made the night velvety black outside.  My daughter got excited and told me to look up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was in Eastern horizon, a very strange, huge group of orange, yellow and red lights in the sky. Together they formed an enormous boomerang shape with the &#34;wing&#34; tips facing downwards.  It was not possible to see an exact outline of the body of the &#34;craft&#34; itself and the lights were hazy due to cloud reflection, but it was possible to see that there was some kind of dark body in a boomerang shape floating in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered in one place and made no noise.  We watched it for approximately 1 minute (which seemed like an incredibly long time).  The body of this craft was, in my estimation, about the size of a baseball field.  I have never seen such an enormous object in the sky in my life.  It appeared to be hovering between 500-1,000 feet above the ground and was located about ½ mile away.  We had an excellent view because we were in a huge parking lot with no tall buildings or trees around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter and I did not take our eyes off the object for one second.  Suddenly, out of no where, an orb of white light appeared on the right &#34;wing&#34; tip near the base.  I would estimate the orb had to be at least about 10 feet in diameter.  It did not have the jagged, uneven, reflective quality of an airplane wing light.  At no time did it generate any long beams of light - it remained perfectly round.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb was exceptionally well defined in its contoured outline, in stark contrast to the other yellow, orange and red glowing lights around this craft.  The orb light was not like the kind of lights you normally see, like street lights, airplane or helicopter lights, building lights, radio tower lights, or field lights which tend to have an intense pinpoint of light in the center and star-like beams that emanate outwards.  The orb light had a completely even-toned luminosity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden, this white orb began traveling along a rather weird pathway.  It moved from the tip of the &#34;wing&#34; to the center of the body of the craft.  It appeared to do some kind of loopty-loop – some fancy circular motions near the left hand side of the craft.  Then, it disappeared momentarily behind the craft and reappeared at the top mid-section of the craft.  It traveled down the right hand side and stopped again at the location at the tip of the &#34;wing&#34; where it had originally appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was odd was that 1) despite its movement it never changed into a beam of light, but remained perfectly round in shape and 2) its movement appeared to be guided intelligently and it was independent of the body of the &#34;craft.&#34;  In other words, the orb seemed to be a separate entity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several seconds after the white orb stopped its voyage around the craft, the entire craft began to disappear.  It did not &#34;disappear&#34; in the sense that you could see it began to travel away in the sky by becoming smaller in size or changing location.  It simply seemed to erase itself!  The lights and dark &#34;body&#34; of the craft on the &#34;wing&#34; tips simply disappeared.  Then the &#34;wings&#34; disappeared.  Then the center of the craft simply blipped out of sight.  In a final &#34;blip&#34; the entire craft was gone.  Even the dark &#34;body&#34; of the craft was simply gone.  There was nothing at all left in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither of us had ever witnessed anything like this before in our lives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be quite eloquent and seemingly serious-minded.  We suspect that she is a highly capable, and reliable, witness.  PD))<n>

My initial reaction was that it was some new kind of advertising blimp with flashy lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to study the aircraft I realized how unfamiliar and strange it appeared and it seemed to be flying too high above the city to be advertising anything legible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Aircraft Description:  Single aircraft -Extremely bright  -Blinking lights, from white, to red, to blue  -Oval in shape  -Slow moving, almost hovering  -Strange flight pattern, (first moved NE, then came back and moved SW vanishing from the viewpoint of my balcony.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Personal Reaction to the Sighting:  After staring for a few minutes in disbelief I grabbed my i-phone took two pictures and a brief video.  Called my mom, a few friends, and your hotline.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Background:  I was alone at the time this occurred, I had just come home from Father’s day dinner with my family and was getting ready to go to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 24 year old female,college graduate in Economics; currently working in Finance and definitely not a person who has given UFO’s much thought until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seeking clarification on what I saw last night.  I’m fascinated by the possibility this could be an unknown, but I would like to know if what I saw was simply a blimp or some other man-made aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If someone could look at my photos and videos and get back to me I would appreciate it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Did anyone else see this???<n>

They were both the same &#34;fire&#34; orange color and seemed to be very high above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched both of these orbs for about two minutes.  Then, one disappeared.  We watched the second one for about 45 seconds, and then it too seemed to disappear before our eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled back on to the road to continue our drive home, and within the next minute I spotted what was possibly a third orb, or perhaps one of the two that saw previously, appear in a different part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just as we were about to pull over to watch the orange orb, it was gone too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The object made no sound and seemed to be decending possibly due to the fire or damage to the craft.  It was very difficult to estimate the size of the object due to there being nothing else in the sky except clouds to compare to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are located on the edge of the Everglades in Florida so it headed towards a sparce and unpopulated area.  There appeared to be no light coming from the object other than the flame.  It was only due to the flame that we could make out the diamond silhouette of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We were having a BBQ when I look up and saw this little plate moving from north-east to south east, very slow.  It was difficult to see, because the distance.  The object stop and if you look in the video, you can see an aircraft flying over the UFO.  Moments later the object just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Im sending the original pictures.

It appeared to be flying low and was extremely fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was in Chicago at Clark and Winnemac while we were walking north on clark street.  It was very bright orange, and larger than anything I&#39;ve seen before.  We knew immediately it wasn&#39;t a plane because we could see two other planes flying in the sky and they were much higher and farther away in the sky.  The planes were a different color- more yellowish/whitish and were moving much slower relative to the orange light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stared at it trying to determine if it was a helicopter or plane, but it didn&#39;t look like anything any of us had seen before. It was literally a round very bright orange light moving forward very fast.  One of my friends even described it as looking like a planet moving fast across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were watching for about 45 seconds as it moved very rapidly across the sky in a straight line then the orange light dimmed, and completely disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched for 5 minutes after the disappearance but it didn&#39;t become visible again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All we could see were the two planes that continued to fly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were all pretty confused as to its disappearance because none of us have ever seen a plane that disappeared while flying across the sky.<n>

They appeared to be coming off the ground in the distance which can only be speculated to be aprox 15 miles.  For the distance of the lights, they seemed large, and very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the orange lights rose in the air, the similarities looked similar to a constalation while hovering there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes passed, they continued to rise, and separate while flying at extreme speeds in various directions.  The speed can not be estimated, but surely was faster than any aircraft ever seen in flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After the seperation of the orange lights took place, they weaved through the atmosphere in very uncharacteristic motions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After witnessing this for an additional 2 min., they shot across the sky which seemed to be the spped of light and dissapeared.<n>

The exact distance from me is unknown.  The light was traveling south. As I continued watching the light, it began to fade.  At that time I assumed it was an airplane with its landing lights being turned off, so I continued to observe the object awaiting the wing lights to start blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Object faded to an extent to where I could no longer see it with my naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately grabbed by binoculars and exited my unit for a better few.  I was able to quickly focus in on the object and at that time, object faded completely.  I scanned the sky attempted to locate the object again but object never re-appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the sighting, I noticed an airliner in the vicinity traveling East, but was a good distance from the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my time off, I am a novice astronomer and I know for a fact this object was not a meteoroid due to its constant speed and slow dimming light.<n>

I have an exterior deck that faces the south. At 10:55 PM,on Saturday, June 18, 2011,<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked out on the deck to take in the night air, before watching the evening news.  I was facing the eastern sky, when I noticed an object, about the size of a &#39;quarter&#39;, circular in nature, with a large organge light emanating from the middle, and many smaller lights surrounding the perimeter of this circular object, spinning, in what I believe was a clockwise direction.  This object was, as I mentioned, the size of a quarter.  It was not small.  It was very high in the sky.  It did NOT make a sound, and its lights were spinning.  It flew from the south-east, to the north at a very high speed.  When I say high speed, I mean, it took about 4 or 5 seconds to cross the horizon, until I could not see it.  It was NOT a plane, helicopter, or any other natural object that I have ever seen in my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live about 6 miles from Montreal&#39;s Trudeau International Airport and ALL of the planes in this area, fly east-west or west-east.  BUT I have to make the point, that I also saw a plane, taking off along the same path as the object that I saw, but at a much, much, much,  slower speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have NEVER  seen any plane move as fast as the object that I viewed.  I have never seen any planes take a northerly path as this one did. I have never seen an obeject as large as this one was.  I have never seen a circular object as large as this one, with an orange center glow, with lights circling the center orange glowing light.  But most importantly, I have never seen, something move so quickly accross the sky.  This thing dissapeared in the space of about 4 to 5 seconds.  It was so high, that I only saw it materialize, halfway in the East horizon, that is, I did NOT see it span or cross the complete horizon.  It appeared about 1/3 of the way, in the South-East horizon, and then flashed accross the horizon, moving North, until my vision was blocked by the roof of my home.  I could only follow it with my eyes, until my roof blocked its progress.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole event took no more than about 4 or 5 seconds.  I can tell you that I have seen, satelites, shooting stars, the &#39;space station&#39;, and other unknown lights in the sky, including high flying planes.   BUT this is the first time, where I can say that what I saw, was NOTHING resembling anything remotely &#39;Earthly&#39; constructed.  This thing was high in the sky.  It was large (the size of a quarter). It was orange in the center and spinning with orange lights on its circumference and it flew at such a high speed, so as to preclude anything else I have ever seen in my life.  This was NOT a plane! I believe it was high in the sky, because the lights were NOT blinding.  They were visible, but not extemely bright.  The evening sky was clear.  There were no clouds in the sky. The moon was a 3/4 moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what else to say about this event, except that I know what I saw.  It was large, spinning and extrememly fast.  I am a believer, now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I watched it, I could not believe what I saw. I can tell you this though, this was not a plane, baloon, star, fighter plane or anything else.  It was round, orange and glowing with lights circling it, and it was motoring at a very high velocity!<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting was over in 5 seconds.  I was in awe and surprised, and delighted and in shock, all at the same time, and I still am.  I don&#39;t know what else to say.<n>

The object was blue/white in the largest main center portion with thin concentric outer layers of darker blue and green on the outer most layer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no discernable sound (but the wind direction would have carried any sound away to the north).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was standing looking directly to the west and my friend was looking to the east.  I was telling him about my last two UFO sightings and how I hadn’t had a good meteor sighting in a good while. It was a few seconds after I said that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned to face the west and moving very rapidly I saw the TEARDROP shape moving straight down between two tall pine trees, disappearing behind some oaks in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object just appeared out of nowhere as I looked at the sky to the west through some tall pines.  It traveled in a perfect vertical line with no smoke trai! l behind it.  It did appear to have a very thin dark streak or attachment to the pointed end (about as long as the object itself) which was facing skyward.  It was very defined and not diminishing in size or brightness as it moved downward.  It was VERY bright. If it was a meteor, it was unlike anything I have ever seen.  The perfect TEARDROP shape was really unusually symmetrical and solid looking.  and did not appear to be burning up in the atmosphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no other aircraft in the vicinity and the moon was still very low to the east and not yet visible above the forest in that direction, so the sky was still fairly dark to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I suspect it must have been at a great distance.  If it did impact the earth, no sound was heard in my direction. Keep looking up and keep reporting!<n>

The lights appeared to be flying from south to north in Fayetteville, Arkansas, along interstate 540, in triangular like formations.   3 or 4 lights seemed too turn west along Wedington road.  At least 2 other lights disappeared from sight completely in an unknown direction, the rest of the lights continued north over interstate 540.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights appeared to be under 10,000 feet (3,030.3 meters) and moving quite fast but at varying speeds.  I witnessed what seemed to be 1 light dropping altitude, speeding  up and  passing another light in the same formation.  The light that was passed  then broke sharp to the west and a few other lights  behind it followed along the same route west over wedington road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can say with 100% assuredness that in my 6 yrs Launching rockets as a MLRS crew member in the US army national guard, and my time in Iraq watching night time take offs and bombing raids by US jets, multiple helicopter formation  at night, and UAV flights, that it was nothing like anything I have ever seen while being in  the military.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also an avid stargazer and satellite watcher.  Saturn was almost right over head (maybe 80 degrees above the horizon) and most of the lights seemd to be at least 3 to 4 times as bright as Saturn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 2 pictures I took on  my phone did not capture the full formations, or other relative objects.  The pictures are a bad quality but I would provide the pictures to any one who wants to study further.<n>

We saw a group of hawks wafting high above our home.  My son asked me &#34;Dad, what are you staring at? That orange thing up there?&#34;  I said &#34;Yeah.  You see it too?&#34;  It was a little bit larger than the size of a pin head and circular in shape.  We watched it for a few minutes with the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Through my binoculars it appeared to be a reddish orange color.  It was moving in an easterly direction very slowly. It was very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son and I took turns looking at the object.  Then, suddenly it was gone.  We looked and looked but could not find it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then spotted a small white/silver circular object close to where we last saw the other object (it was very high in the sky too).  Through the binoculars it appeared to shimmer/blinking.  It was moving in a westerly direction very slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were way too high to be standard civilian passenger jets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get my video camera.

So I googled &#34;how do I report a UFO&#34; and found this website.<n>

I stopped bent tied my shoe and right as i was about to rush off again I noticed something from the left corner of my eye I looked up and over to the left their it was. Hovering  no higher then a 3 story apartment building.  I didn&#39;t know what I was looking at the shape was teardrop-ish dark colored at first.  Next it started its engine like a car only instead of engine noise the objects sides lite up just like a car starting its engine without the noise once started it stayed lit.  Then I could see the whole bottom very clearly.  It was like a see though radio or something  how you can see all the wiring and the circuit board.  It took of with speed and like a flash of lightning it lite the sky and it was gone.<n>
6/17/11 00:00|Naples|FL|Unknown|?|Possible abduction.|6/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/110/S110603.html|184|ndxe201106| Possible abduction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t exactly know where to begin.  To be honest I don&#39;t even want to speak about it, but I feel like someone should know what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I begin.  You must understand I don&#39;t want anyone to know about what happened.  I don&#39;t want to become famous.  I don&#39;t want to be known.  I don&#39;t want to make money off this.  I don&#39;t want to ever speak about it again it scares me so much.  This is the truth as best as I can tell it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It all seemed like a dream except there was a physical sense of reality and feeling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went to sleep around 10pm.  In a room with another person sleeping in a bed next to my bed, similar to sharing a hotel room.  I go to sleep.  Everything was normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I regain consciousness to what seemed like a hospital room.  The first thing I noticed was I was laying back down on what appeared to be a hospital bed.  Immediately I assume I&#39;m in a hospital.  As I realize there is no way I could be in a hospital I began to look around....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I notice the walls of the room seem to be of a metallic color.  This freaked me out because I know hospital rooms have bright colors and do not have metal walls.  This is when I went on a defense mode.  I started trying to understand my surrounding environments and the more details I noticed the more confused and scared I became.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I make a quick glance to my right and I think I saw 2 people.  Near my feet another 2.  Then to my left a person sitting in a chair perpendicular to my &#34;hospital bed.&#34;  My attention is struck by the person on the left of me in the chair.  At this time I realized I was unable to move almost like being asleep but awake at the same time.  Maybe I could explain the feeling as in a coma but with a mental awareness plus I could see everything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The person to the left was a female human.  This I know for sure. I was so scared I remember her telling me it was ok and it would all be over soon.  I then look at her as she puts a needle in my left arm.  Similar to how an IV needle is placed but different.  Their technique of placing the needle required no tape or gauze to hold it in place.  Which I have never seen and I have been in the hospital before so I know how IV needles are placed.  The needle itself was metal but it&#39;s luster was odd.  I can&#39;t remember if it was too dull or too shiny. But I know for a fact the luster was off.  Nothing I have ever seen before possibly an unknown metal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So, the lady to the left of me said there was nothing to worry about.  When I heard that I went from defense mode to panic mode.  Nothing to worry about to me means your screwed and you can&#39;t do any thing about it.  So I tried to move but couldn&#39;t.  Then the real panic and fear set into me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again you have to understand something about me.  I am NOT scared easily.  I am not weak.  And I have no problem facing fears or going into combat.  So for me to be scared out of my mind.  It truly speaks for itself.  Anyways....<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last thing I remember seeing at that point was the person in front of me (one of the people by me feet).  They had what seemed to be a wire connecting to an led flashlight (that&#39;s what it looked like) it was all white and I could see the &#34;led bulbs&#34; in the &#34;flashlight.&#34;  I was explained through a mental communication that this was a way to know or decipher something.  I think it was to know who I am or to locate me or something.  It was done for a reason I just can&#39;t remember exactly why.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The flashlight thing was designed so the placement of each bulb could be measured through its complex variations and measurements so that it could be calculated to individually differentiate people.  In essence to separate them or track them.  Not sure exactly what or why.  But it didn&#39;t seem to be in bad intent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They literally touched the lights to my right foot.  I didn&#39;t feel any pain or anything.  Just like someone touching your foot with a flashlight.  I blacked out after that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke back up in the same room.  No idea how much time had passed by. No one was in the metal room.  Just me by myself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Near where my feet were, were the person holding the flashlight was, there was a door. Same color as the walls.  Metal.  I go through the door.  (Now it gets hard to explain).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a diagonal hallway.  On one side (opposite of the door) it was a solid metal flat wall.  Maybe 100 feet long from what I could see.  I went 10 feet to the right.  Saw a door. Opened it.  It was the same looking room I was just in.  I close the door.  Start walking down the hallway in the opposite direction.  I pass maybe 10 rooms identical to what I just came out of.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I get to what seems to be a pivot point In the ship I almost shit in my pants.  I could only imagine the ship I was in being the shape of the letter V.  The pivot point I speak of would be the intersecting plot point.  When I got to that spot there was a giant window.  Maybe 30 feet tall 75 feet wide.  And when I looked out the window I saw earth.  It was glorious to view.  Making me realize I was not on my own planet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I panicked needless to say.  Then I saw beings walk by me. Not human.  The one I focused on had an olive colored skin. Looked wet but dry maybe like a lizard or snake.  The face looked like a (Mexican x Asian x African) in facial features (nose mouth eyes etc).  The strangest thing about them was they had what looked like fish gills, on the side of their face, where a humans cheeks are.  Almost like slicing a persons cheeks to look like gills or flaps.  They must have been 6.5-7 feet tall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked the being if this was all real and it grabbed my hand.  Next thing I know I regain consciousness inside my own bathroom.  I was stuck staring in the mirror in my bathroom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I snapped into reality I realized I was in shock.  I looked where the needle was inserted into my arm and there was a blood spot or scab (coagulated blood).  When I realized I was staring in the mirror I noticed I was hallucinating (sort of, it was a feeling not a visual).  I felt like I had been in the ocean all day, got out of the ocean, and still felt the waves.  Or like I was skiing on a mountain all day and got off he mountains and felt like I was still skiing.  I also came to realize that at this point it was 6:45-7:00am.  Almost 9 hours had passed.  I felt so tired like I hadn&#39;t slept all night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My hallucinations wore off a few hours after the bathroom.  I came to the conclusion that the hallucinations had something to do with ((what)) they did to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few weeks later a spot identical to the shape of the led lights to my foot showed up.  They have never left i still have the physical marking left over from what they did even to this day.<n>

As I watched, this object suddenly grew slightly larger with a flash of white light then immediately shrank down to the size of the surrounding stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I kept my eye on it the small shape slowly begin moving upwards toward the zenith of the star field, faded away and was gone about 5 seconds after it started moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 minutes later I noticed two very large, bright white objects in the southern sky.  They appeared exactly as the first object did in brightness and size and they appeared to be about a hands width distance apart if I stretched my arm out in front of me.  They were positioned vertically to one another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched them in this stationary position for about 10 seconds.  At that time they shrank down to the size of stars and then begin moving together toward the west very slowly.  They appeared to move together as one unit, keeping an equal distance apart as they moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They grew dimmer and disappeared about 5 seconds after they started moving.<n>

I had just started calling a friend and was getting ready to light my cigarette and was leaving a voicemail for my friend when I looked up into the northwest sky and saw two reddish/orange almost amber in color orb&#39;s moving eastward.  I live near the ocean, so they were traveling east towards the city.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They started to go behind some trees off of my balcony, I ran out to the pool area here at my apartment building and saw the 2 orbs still moving in the sky, but slower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I had thought about getting my video camera and ran back inside to get it, when I went back out to the pool area with my video camera I just saw one of the two orbs, it was stationary and then started to fade away.  It took approx. 30-45 seconds for it to fade away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I live near the ocean there was a light haze, the orbs seemed to move slower than a jet and seemed to be larger than what you would normally see as an airplane.  The orbs did&#39;t flash, they just seemed to be amber/red in color with a very slight trail or aura (could have been the haze in the sky) they almost seemed like fireballs.  If it had been just one, I would have thought it was a meteor or space junk entering, but there were two of them, traveling at about the same speed, one ahead of the other slightly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I made it out to the pool area with my video camera, one of the orbs was gone, but there was still one there and it had stopped moving and just stayed in one spot and then slowly faded away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As far as my background, I grew up in the area, I am a small business owner and in my late 30&#39;s.<n>

We saw it from the second floor window of our house, which faces east.  It seemed to be flying (initially) due west over the skies of Parsippany/Denville.  It was extremely bright and very red in color.  There was also a bit of orange around the perimeter of the object.  It had a triangular shape and was moving slowly...at some points, seeming to just float.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued west for about a minute and then began heading north.  By the time I made it downstairs and outside to see it, it had moved slightly behind the trees and my view was obstructed.  As I continued to try and see it, it appeared to begin to move back in an eastward direction and eventually I lost sight of it because of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The most notable and striking thing about this UFO was its bright red color.  It almost looked like it was on fire and flaming.<n>

6/17/11 14:00|Calgary (Canada)|AB|Sphere|45min/1 hr|Four spherical orbs seen high in the sky, including 4 tiny white craft fly from one of the orbs.|5/15/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96893.html|193|ndxe201106| Four spherical orbs seen high in the sky, including 4 tiny white craft fly from one of the orbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On or around the 17 of june, 2011, I went out for a jog in my native city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  As I was running in a park in Calgary in a park called centanary park, I happen to notice the police helicopter conducting some sort of patrol manouvere.  I could tell that they were because the sound of the blades was louder, slower and the movement of the helicopter was in a sideways positon, as to look down to the ground. I stopped to observe it for a little while. As I was watching it, I remember noticing that when I looked at the rudder, in the distance I noticed these two objects in the sky, being stationary (this diverted my attention away from the helicopter, obviously!)  Eventually, these two objects began to slowly move away from each other.  One went north from me, and the other flew south towards me. I remember distinctly telling myself in my mind, &amp;quot; I will observe both of them, back and forth, until I lose sight of one of them.  So, back and ! forth my eyes darted from one to the other until I lost sight of the one moving north of me. I still kept my eyes on the one that was moving south, and now almost moving directly over me. What I remember from this object was how slow it moved across the sky.  It also could stop in mid air and linger or hover. I noticed that it was very high in the sky - I can say that they were in the cloud range of the cirrus clouds. I also noticed that the object was spherical in shape, and that the fuselage was a relective shiny, or silverish material.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, this is the part were it gets weird. I had noticed all these things from this one object because it had come almost directly over me, and its movement was slow. When it had come to a halt over me, I noticed - out of thin air - a spherical orb object, reflecting the sun aswell, being red in color, appear out of no where ! I was stunned, in shock and utter disbelief ! This would be the third object I had observed so far: the first one flying north and being lost to distance and clouds. Anyhow, I sat in shock, wondering what these two objects were ? I remember seeing birds fly around the area of sky I was looking up at, and this gave me some perspective on the objects. This is where the first shiny metallic orb started to move in a North Easterly way. I kept watching it, and the new red one as much as I could. Eventually I lost sight of the Silverish shiny metallic one in clouds in the North Eastern sky. The reddish shiny orb had not moved since it first appeared out of th! in air to the left of the silverish shiny orb. This is around the time when I noticed a second reddish shiny orb was in the sky to the right of me or in the Eastern part of the sky. I do not know if this one had simply crept up to that position or if it had simply appeared there like the first red one ( or the last one I had obeserved of the four ) Now, here is another observation I noticed from these objects that left me dumbfounded in utter disbelief. Before I go into the detail of what I saw from the red object, I want to state that: if I had not have looked and watched the police helicopter in that first instance, I would not have noticed the first two objects in the sky simply because they were really high in the sky, tiny and one would have to be actively searching the sky to see them. Anyway,  out of  the first reddish shiny object I observed, ( or third witnessed by me ) 4 tiny whitish looking objects, and I mean tiny, much tinyer than the 4 objects seen, came out o! f the first reddish shiny object and they flew towards the sec! ond ( or fourth one seen ) object. like I said, these 4 little craft were whitish, and I compare them to sperm because they had a tail or left a tail and there movement is like that of human sperm. I was shocked to see them and did not know what they were, but they moved across the sky towards the second reddish shiny orb. I do not know if they entered the orb or if they simpy continued beyond it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the part of of my memory that gets somewhat hazy. I don&#39;t remember what happened to the first reddish shiny object, but I remember that the second one I saw - the one that I did not notice where it came from or the fourth one that I saw - but I do recall it now moving slowly. At one point, I lost view of it  because it flew over clouds but then it appeared again. This is the point, I remember, where I began to start following it and I moved for the first time in about 45 min to an 1 hour after first seeing the initial two. As I crossed the bridge, I noticed a man with a camera and he was taking pictures of a couple. I felt soo compelled to tell them of my experiece, but I feel as if they were not interested. I continued to follow the object, I walked on the bike path, and then another person, a man, came by and I told him and even pointed to the reddish shiny object. He could not see it and I remember him saying something to rationalize what it could be I was &amp;quot;s! eeing&amp;quot;. Soon after this, I recall seeing the final of the four objects I had seen this day, not including the four minute craft that came out of the third or first reddish shiny object. It looked to be getting smaller in the sky, as if it were rising in altitude, and then I simply lost sight of it due to the amount of clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is my encounter of the first kind with UFOs - Unidentified Flying Objects.<n>

If something otherworldly  It was doing a fair job of imitating a small plane. sounded just like a prop plane.  weather was clear!  very light clouds 20,000 feet?  most people would think it was just a small plane flying by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m not sure what to think.<n>

6/17/11 00:00|Plum Boro|PA|Other||Green Triangle Craft 350 ft. above head.|7/4/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90323.html|199|ndxe201106| Green Triangle Craft 350 ft. above head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving home from work, it was about a year ago, the exact date was unknown, but I tried to post around the known time frame, at first I thought I was seeing things, and I was beyond terrified at first, I have seen one other unidentified flying object one time before this, but since after, I have been seeing an increasing amount, around once a month.  But the object that I saw that night was the most outstanding of them all.  It was around 11:30 to midnight, and I was on my way home from work, I was only 16 then, I was washing dishes, but I driving down a road called saltsburg road, when to my right side, high above the trees, I saw a green triangle of what seemed to be very BRIGHT LED lights, they were not flashing, they were a solid steady color.  I pulled off the road into a little gardening center called schrams landscaping. I pulled over, and the object proceeded to slowly fly over the church on the hilltop and slowly coast towards me.  The objecy did not directly fly over my head, but about 150ft out in thr front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As scared as I was, I proceeded to stand and watch the object. I continued to slowly float across the road infront of me and fly into the woods across the street. I stood and watched the object about scared beyond my self control.  The object stopped in mid-air, and floated there for around 5-10 seconds, it then slowly decended maybe about 50 feet, the object was probaly only 300-400 feet in the air, while the object decended, I quickly proceeded to run to my vehicle, and turned around to exam the object one more time.  While doing so the triangle of brightly colored green LED lights, began to spin, it started off spinning slowly but quickly proceeded to accelerate.  As it started to spin, the trianlge of green lights grew into a large circle of green lights, and began to spin at a high rate of speed, the faster the object to seemed to spin, the closer and closer that cirle of lights came to each other, t! he cirle grew smaller and smaller into one giant green light,  I then h eard a woosh noise as if the wind were blowing, and the green light was completly gone, I then proceeded to drive home at a very fast unsafe rate of speed, constantly checking in the sky for this object to make sure it was not following me, when I got to my road I pulled over and checked one more time, and saw nothing, I quickly flew down my road and pulled into the driveay and checked one more time, saw nothing so I ran inside explaining to my mother and brother what I saw that night. It was absoloutly amazing, because this was not the first time I have seen unidentified flying craft, but after this, my sightings have increased alot. If I can explain here, I would like to explain some other odd sightings I have seen. The first UFO I have ever seen was in Murrysville PA, at a park called Townsend park, probaly around 7-8 p.m. It was my brothers boy scout meeting, and I wondered off to walk around, I saw these three white lights in the sky. They were extremly bright white lig! hts much like the ones I saw in july last year, but there were only three of them, in a perfect row, seperated equaly in the night sky. They were moving not at an excessive rate of speed, but quicker than most man powered aircraft. And the way these lights moved through the sky, is absoloutly undescribale, the only way I could ever show somone how they moved through the sky would be drawing it out step by step on paper. When I saw this, I didnt think too much on it, but after seeing the one last july, it really occured to me what I saw that night at the park. My second sighting was the green triangle of lights that flew above me that night in july. My third sighting, which didnt occur until early this spring was in april, exact date unknown, I know it was evening time, and I was taking the garbage down to the bottom of my driveway, and I saw a bright white star looking object in the sky, at first again I did not think much of it, but I still continued to watch it, because t! his time, this weird feeling overcame my whole body, a feeling! that af ter feeling it, i remeber I felt the both nights I saw the other two UFO&#39;s. I watched this object for about a minute, it sat steady in the evening sky, then it slowly flew very genly to the left, so slow it almost looked motionless, but I focused on the object and noticed it was slowly moving, then it flashed a very bright white, almost a blinding bright, I turned my face away from the light, I flinched because it was so sudden and bright, but when I looked for the object, I could no longer find it in the sky. My fourth sighting was back in May, It was evenging time again, and I was driving down Route 366 in murrysville pa. Out in the distance, I saw two lights hovering around, they gave off a bright whiteish bluish glow, the two objects were hovering in the sky together, slowly flying around each other, hovering for around a minute, the lights got a little bit brighter, but nothing too exsesive, they slowly flew close to each other, almost as if they joined into one object,! and it slowly hovered upwards into the sky for about 15 seconds, and then took off at an abnormal un-human rate of speed. It was almost an instant aceleration, into the sky, then about 30 or so seconds later, 3 military planes, couldnt ID. what kind of model planes, but they were larger looked like cargo planes, two engines on each wing, all flying in a cordinated group, flew over the highway, and proceeded towards where the objects were in the sky. Now what makes this sighting even more abnormal than it already is, is that my mother and brother were outside walking the dog, and they called me shortly after to tell me they saw a UFO and they now believe everything I have told them about what I saw. When I got home that night I had my mom explain fully what she saw, and what she described was exactly what I saw, I had her come outside and point to me where she saw them in the sky, and it matched perfectly with where I saw them, and both my mother and brother saw the lights,! and the planes. Now my 5th sighting wasa the night after this! , I saw the same EXACT two lights in the sky, the birght white/blue glowing balls. They were doing the same thing, but they were in the opposite side of the sky, the first night I saw them they were hovering in the westward are the sky, the second night they were eastward. I stopped and examined them, and showed my girlfriend them, she too saw them and was amazed. This time they were there for only a matter of maybe 15 seconds, and flew away. The night before they conjoined each other and flew away together, but the night after, they did not rejoin, but flew off with the same instant aceleration as the night before, but in total opposite directions. Since that night I have seen a few odd lights but nothing I can confirm like that, until tonight July 1st, I was on my way to work, I work outside of down town pittsburgh from 10-6 A.M. It was 9:23 P.M exactly, and in the very gently illuminated sky, I saw a bright oragne, firery object, slowly floating along the woods, I was a massive b! all of fire, but seemed to die down as flew downwards, and the fire proceeded to get brighter as it hovered upwards, I know that it was not a hotair baloon for the fact that it was close enough to see the shape of the obeject, it seemed to be a perfect golden colored cube, with fire surrounding it, and it slowly flew into the woods, then disapereared into the night time sky. This sighting tonight is the reason why I am reporting everything I have seen, and when I see more UFO&#39;s, I will be reporting them here. I hope my information is helping, and I hope it will do some justice. Thank you very much for taking your time to review this.<n>

On the east horizon I saw two red orbs that were roughly a hundred feet apart, and pulsing from a red to a amber color. They were moving along at a very fast speed, and no sound what so ever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With the speed of a jet they moved over the city, I’m guessing at roughly a hundred to two hundred feet above the ground, they stopped over the city for a second and moved strait up by about a hundred feet. After that they continued on over the city on the westward course it was originally on, until it went out of my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There wasn’t a lot of clouds in the sky, and no ambient light was coming from surrounding houses or street lights. It couldn’t have been a glare on glass because we were outside. It wasn’t a plane because it was too close to the ground and moving to fast. The only conclusion of the citing was that it was in fact a U.F.O. though out my life I never really believed in extra terrestrial beings, but without a doubt in my mind this was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite objective and sincere.

It was orange-red in color----looked just like a star, about 2.5-3.0 level magnitude of brightness.  It was not a meteor----too slow for that.  It was not a jet or any other conventional aircraft.  Too fast for that.  It was not an orbital satellite---too fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From my vantage-point in East-Central Indiana, I first observed it outside of the area of the &#34;dipper&#34; part of the Big Dipper.

It was definitely a UFO. My friend didn’t take it seriously at first, and he didn’t get a second chance to look at it and maybe think twice, since it disappeared too fast; which means I didn’t get a chance to catch it on tape because there was just not enough time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Fascinated by this, I have made an animation of the event that fairly describes what I have seen.<n>

My family and I went to Disneyland after her graduation.  The UFO was seen in the evening at Sleeping Beauty&#39;s Castle during the end of the night fireworks show.  During the middle of the fireworks show, my family and I, along with the hundreds of people at Disney, noticed a shape approaching the castle coming from the West.  The shape became evident that it was in the shape of a saucer as it flew closer to the castle.  Hundreds of eye witnesses and myself became very quiet as it flew over us.  My best guess is it was maybe 500 ft above us as we could all see it was silver, metallic and it had a series of lights on the underside of the craft that spiraled in a counter-clockwise direction.  The craft never made a sound as it flew over us.  The flight pattern was smooth and linear.  The craft never stopped.  It continued to fly through the fireworks, over the castle and onto the horizon. I tried to video tape! it with my little digital camera; however, all you could see was the lights swirling in the counter-clockwise direction and could not quite make out the shape of the craft because it was too dark.  I remember listening to a bunch of the surrounding people whispering and asking if that was a UFO as it approached the castle.  There is no doubt in my mind that what we saw was not an airplane, helicopter or any other flying craft we typically see in the sky.<n>

The light was only on for about 10 seconds and then went out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next 15-30 minutes, I saw the same thing repeated at least 3 more times in different spots in the same vicinity over the ocean.<n>

Me, my brother and my friend were down the harbour fishing of the rocks.  While we were fishing we was watching this huge black thunder cloud slowly makings it&#39;s way to land, on which over the next hour or two it past over us, lightly raining on us.  We stayed fishing for about another 20 mins with no bites, so decided to call it a night. While walking back to the cars and still looking at this massive cloud, I observed what I can only describe as a neon blue bird shape light flying in and out of this cloud kinda like a eagle riding on a thermal updraft.  I felt really stupid but told my brother and my friend what I just saw, my friend laughed and kept on walking while me and my brother kept talking but looking at the cloud.  All of a sudden we seen it together but this time it went in a straight line in and out of the cloud, then disappeared.  This thing was massive and distance it covered and th! e speed it turned baffled me and my brother to this day<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The sky was clear, full moon and stars were visible. The temp was in the 70&#39;s and there was a slight breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood on the beach, I was standing with my back to the water, talking to my sister in law when suddenly, she grabbed my shoulders and turned me around; I saw an array of lights in the sky, low on the horizon; much lower than an airplane.  The lights were amber colored, evenly spaced apart making a triangular shape and leading to a straight line.  They did not blink or move at all.  We looked at them for about 2-3 minutes then they started to blink out, one by one, in order.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About a half hour later, they appeared again;  One light in the row appeared; then another next to it; then another, till there were 7. The lights were evenly spaced apart; just like before.  There was no sound.  The lights were over the ocean; about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  It was completely dark out, other than the moon. We could not see anything but the lights ( no craft).  What we saw is EXACTLY like what is shown in the picture of the lights taken on May 8, at 20:15 in New Bedford, MASS.  (First page of your website).  We had a digital camera with us, which broke, inexplicably, about 2 mins before the lights appeared.<n>

The sky was fairly clear and the humidity was low. The ocean was almost calm. The waves were very small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not sure of the exact time, it may have been at about 9:15ish that one of my friends saw a small red light that looked like it was slowly descending toward the water, then it disappeared.  I did not see that one. It did not last long.  She thought it was odd, but probably explainable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10-15 minutes later, all four of us saw one large bright red light suddenly appear under the moon, due east over the water about halfway between the moon and the horizon right under the moon.  I&#39;m estimating the moon to have risen to about 30 degrees above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 2-3 seconds later another large red light appeared beside and to the left of the first light.  It was the exact same size and intensity of light.  They both stayed in the same spot without changing in size, intensity or location for about 8-10 seconds, then instantly disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did not see any aircraft or hear any sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Proportionally, the red lights appeared to be about 1/20th the size of the moon from our vantage point on the beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a teacher, one woman is a business owner, one is a secretary and one is currently working in retail.<n>

Our base camp was about half way between Eureka and Carlin Nevada on Rte 278. Middle of nowhere. I had the evening off, and decided to start a camp fire shortly after dark. I had just opened a beer and was playing my guitar when the red lights showed up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before I start my description I have to say that my recollection of this sighting is hazy, it happened over a year ago, and even a few days later I could not remember details. What I remember is a very low pitched, quiet hum.  That is what go my attention.  I looked behind me, and two glowing red lights were hovering near by. I set down my guitar and stood up, walking toward the lights to see better. I noticed another set behind them.  I could not see the outline of any object, only the lights, but the way they were moving, it seemed that they were connected.  They were moving strangely, as if the objects were long and flat and turning from a horizontal position to a vertical position.  It took me a minute to realize the red lights were connected and the object was enormous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At some point one set of lights came close, or at least it seemed close due to the scale of the object. I would say it was at least 50 meters in diameter.  I do not remember the object leaving.  That is the strangest part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting at the campfire, and was not going to tell any of my coworkers (they were small minded) when they came back from the field.  One of my co-workers, who I had a good rapport with came to the fire and stood there with me for a few minutes before saying &amp;quot;I just saw a ufo&amp;quot;. I nearly pissed I was so excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He described red lights, but in a different, more stereotypical &#34;ufo&#34;; configuration.

I saw an object which at first I thought was a high flying eagle but I saw immediately that the object was stationary and not changing shape.  It was dark colored and I would describe the shape as a boomerang with squared off tips.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was about to draw my wife and daughter’s attention to the object when it started to move and appeared to dive.  After a second or so I realized it was not diving but moving away to the west at an incredible rate of acceleration.  It stayed below the cloud level as I could see it until it disappeared behind the golf course tree line to the west of the ballpark.  All of this occurred in less then ten seconds.   The object did appear to change shape but I am not sure if it really did or just appeared to as it moved away at a high rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been around civilian and military aircraft all of my life.  My father was a flight instructor and I spent 4 years in the USAF and 28 years in the Montana Air National Guard as a civilian technician.  I am very familiar with military aircraft and I can tell you for sure that this was not a military aircraft.  I have never seen anything, with the possible exception of an air to air missile, accelerate at the rate this object did.  If I was going to guess at the rate of acceleration I would say this object went from stationary to well over mach 1 in about 3 seconds.  I would estimate that from the time the object started to move until it was out of my sight was less then 5 seconds.   The object made absolutely no noise and there was no sonic boom.  The Air Guard here has F-15s and there were none flying in the area at the time of the sighting nor did I hear any after the sighting.  I continued to scan the sky for about the next 15 minutes but did not see the object agai! n.<n>

I have seen all forms aircraft and heard all types of propulsion engines and what I had seen that early morning was nothing any human could possibly create.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was roughly 4:15 in the morning when I left my friends house, I was driving down Washington Valley Road and it was still dark.  I was the only car on the road at this time but as I was driving I saw in the distance, not even half a mile away a shimmering light, almost like a star in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a bright star and I couldn&#39;t stop staring, but as i kept driving down the road I noticed it was way to low for it be any kind of star.  My next assumption was that it was some sort of helicopter with its search lights on however odd that may be.  I was driving at a steady pace of 40 miles an hour but something possessed me to slow to down to a mere 10 miles an hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As i kept creeping up towards this hovering light i was maybe a mere 50 meters away and i noticed a strange thing that this bright light had no definitive body shape around it.  It was almost as if someone lit phosphorus in the sky....it was that bright.  But within milliseconds the light disappeared and the object became solid.  Strange lights began to blip around the edge of the craft in wonderful colors of blue green and green blue in that succession.  It wasn&#39;t moving fast at all, it was just slowly hovering down this road and i knew i was going to intersect it right underneath this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can still see it in my mind as i drove right below it.  It looked as if it had a triangular bottom with three bright red enormous bulbs on each of the edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I rolled down the windows I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes what i was actually seeing.  I wanted to listen for an y signs of propulsion that allowed this massive object to hover so low to the ground and to move so slow.  But i heard nothing, the only sound that I heard was coming from the engine of my Honda Odyssey and even that 4 liter engine was not that loud at 10 miles an hour.  Silence complete silence.... This craft was in no hurry and it kept hovering past me as i drove away, or at least that&#39;s what i could remember.  And  all i could think during this entire time was god I wish i wasn&#39;t the only one to see this, so someone can back me up, so that no one can claim that I&#39;m some washed up soldier hallucinating objects in the sky, maybe this will help with your report maybe not but please by no means discredit what i have seen....<n> <n><n> <n><n> i can still draw the object that I&#39;ve seen that night and i still have dreams about it every so often recollecting the event in patches.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This was unusual because the object was huge and blocked out the sky over the tops of the trees. It was huge and had many lights on it, so I then proceed to run out into the yard to get a better look, but by the time I got there it was going over the side of the house and I could only see a glimpse of it as it passed over.  I&#39;m still confused about what I saw. It was no plane, it was extremely  huge and was not  shaped like a plane.  It was low flying, right over the tops of the trees and it blocked out the sky.

The objects appeared to each have 2 lights. The objects were flying in large circles. From the angle we were looking it could look as if they were forming a circle around the building; however the objects were way farther in distance. If I pointed my arm up it would look like I was trying to pinch a mosquito. There was also a plane to the right pointing upward.  Compared to how fast the 2 objects were going the plane looked extremely slow.  The objects flew in circles as well as around each other almost as if they were playing tag.   After about 7 minutes they simply disappeared. From the height that we were the sky was more visible than if you would be walking on the street.<n>

Our development is proteted by trees to the East.  All of a sudden, I saw a large circular aircraft appear above the treeline.  It was probably about 150 feet away from me, and only about 200 feet in the air (it was not significantly higher than the treeline).  By my best guess, the craft was maybe 100 feet in diameter.  This was not just a case of a small orb in the sky - it was right there in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a large quantity of bright blue lights on the underside, and on the vertical surface were many bright white lights.  There were also blue lights that lined the top perimeter of the craft.  There were also red lights that seemed to be randomly placed around the craft as well.  All three of the different colored lights were blinking at random intervals (individual lights were all blinking randomly).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft hovered above the tree line for about 1 minute, and I could hear a very faint pulsating noise.  There was no wind effect that could be noticed on the trees, etc.  It then started to move North very slowly, at the same elevation, and eventually passed aross the Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal.  I watched it move North until I could no longer see it (it eventually got far enough to where it fell below the horizon line).  The craft looked identical from my view looking to the East, as it did in my view looking to the North<n>

My initial assumption was that it was a commercial plane flying lower than usual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began searching for wings on the aircraft to no avail.  The aircraft flew in on a 90 degree angle which I thought was weird because I thought all commercial aircrafts could only fly at a 45 degree angle or at a certain angle; while this aircraft was flying in a horizontal line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft flew, from what I could measure with my arms, in a 40 degree angle in 10 seconds.  It flew through the lowest cloud formation I could see and the lights were so powerful I could still see it throught the cloud formation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seconds after the aircraft disappeared I saw a reflection in a window of a bright red light on the opposite building in front of me; as if to say the light was comimng from behind my building.  As I looked behind my building I saw nothing.  I still heard the aircraft about 3 seconds after it disappeared from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back into the building.  About 10 min later I stepped outside and called the National UFO Reporting Hotline and realized the sky was completely clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded and credible.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD))<n>
6/14/11 22:00|Bellevue|WA|Light|1 minute|Man witnesses 7 or 8 unidentified lights move rapidly overhead.|6/20/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81777.html|239|ndxe201106| Belmont<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conditions:  No precipitation.  Excellent visibility.  Moderately-high cloud ceiling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What/where:  Driving, I entered the I-405 freeway on-ramp at SE 112th st in Bellevue, WA, north bound, and saw approximately 7 or 8 lights, traveling southbound over Mercer Island, in what looked like a holding pattern for aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled off to the side of the onramp (where the Metro buses load) to observe and film with my IPhone.  These were not recognizable as aircraft since each craft (i.e. light) was spaced much too closely together.  Their elevation was lower than what aircraft normally fly at and they were at various altitudes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were not any strobes (white, green, or red) that would indicate these were valid aircraft; these lights were of a pinkish-orange color.  All were the same color and brightness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the lights traveled south until the what appeared to be the southern end of Mercer Island and then elevated up to the clouds and could not be seen thereafter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 7 of these passed us, an 8th followed them at extremely high speed and also elevated into the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Curious to see more, I exited the freeway at Coal Creek Parkway and drove to the top of Somerset (neighborhood).  From the top of Somerset, I could see aircraft approaching SeaTac Intl. Airport, which is much further away than Mercer Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The aircraft approaching SeaTac had visible strobes - so the lights that I saw, which were much closer than SeaTac, clearly were not typical aircraft as no strobes were present.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have footage of some of them captured on my IPhone.<n>

At about 30 degrees above the horizon over the ocean we witnessed a series of lights that appeared and disappeared over the course of about 10 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first set of lights included three lights in a row that appeared parallel to the horizon.  These lights were reddish-orange in color, and were clearly not stars or aircraft.  The conditions were mostly clear, and there was almost a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These three lights appeared to &#34;bank&#34; to the right.  There was no noise.  In the sky these lights were about the same size as each other, and about 1/16th of the size of a full moon (the moon was visible from our viewpoint where the lights were as well).<n> <n><n> <n><n> All three of these lights disappeared at the same time (no noise and no fading, just blinked off).  Then these three lights appeared again at a close but different location, and then quickly disappeared again (about one second in total).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights then began to flash randomly (sometimes none, sometimes one, two, three, up to six in total at any one point).  These lights again were all within the same field of vision over the SSE sky.<n>

I tried to get to a spot with an open sky view and found one that was only slightly obscured by trees.  I watched them go behind the treeline and they didn&#39;t come out the other side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed stationary or moving very slowly.  It was hard to tell because the sun was setting.  I couldn&#39;t see the shapes of them but they all had the same steady yellowish-red light and made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home, I tried to find something online to explain them but found nothing.<n>

As it flew overhead it was obvious that it was flying at a lower altitude than most planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went and got my wife to come outside and see the light.  She came outside and watched as it passed overhead.  We both noticed it was silent.

6/14/11 09:45|Las Vegas|NV|Teardrop|1 hour +|Long duration daylight sighting of 2 craft west/southwest of Las Vegas strip|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82554.html|245|ndxe201106| Long duration daylight sighting of 2 craft west/southwest of Las Vegas strip<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Tuesday, June 14, 2011, my wife and I were at Aria Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas on the 2nd day of our 5 day vacation.  When in Vegas, our routine is to get to the pool at or around the time they open, which is typically 9:00 am.  That day we arrived at the pool, picked our spots, and were in the pool by 9:30.  At this time, half of Las Vegas is still asleep, so there were no more than 20 people at this pool at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions: Hot (probably high 80’s already, I believe it got up to 103 later that day); not a single cloud in the sky. No wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after dipping in the pool, I noticed a large, unusually shaped white luminous come from over the mountain range to the West/Northwest of the Las Vegas strip (I believe the Spring Mountain Range?).  There is not one thing I can think of to describe the shape, except that it was a cluster of some sorts, with a rod coming down from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My initial skeptical reaction was that it was balloons, but: at that distance, and it’s size, it could not be balloons, and at that point is was easy enough to see detail that it definitely was not balloons.  Plus it emitted a bright, glowing light. I was pointing it out to my wife, and other people around us began to notice and talk about it as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object got higher in the sky, then started moving south along the mountain range (towards the flight path of McCarren Airport).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, another object came over the range.  This object, was smaller, and appeared to be a single oval shape.  It was the same white color, and also emitted the sam! e bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next hour or so, we watched the objects as they moved to the south/southwest.  They were definitely moving in tandem, and sometimes swap positions (left/right), but they always were fairly far apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was around 11:00 am when I saw the two lights for the last time.  They were quite faint, far &amp; at a high altitude.  One was straight to the south, and one was southwest; they were very far apart at this point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here are some other notes:<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Right after the second object came into view, the area they were would have been directly in the flight path for departures/arrivals at McCarren Airport. I noticed that during that time period, no planes took off or landed from that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If possible, can you attain air traffic control recording, chatter from that day? Whatever the objects were, they had to have been talking about it, because the control tower would have had clear view of the objects the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Also, there were approximately 10 helicopters the roared overhead (LV strip/Grand Canyon tours) during the time period where the sighting took place. Pilots &amp; tourists had to have seen it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -Reason for waiting to report after a month: I thought for sure someone else, perhaps an aviation professional would have made a report by now. I’ve been checking this site and others like it daily since this sighting happened hoping to see something but to no avail. I am still disturbed at how blatant these craft were above a major city, one of the busiest airports in the US, and the fact that they came from the general direction of Area 51 &amp; the Nevada Test Site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -I’d be happy to answer any questions an investigator may have.<n> <n><n> <n><n> -I can draw a picture of the objects; and/or a diagram of the timeline of the movement of them upon request.<n>

As they passed my car, the formation was maintained, but it wasn&#39;t a formation that is consistent to the military as it was very lose and not in line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The route I take from work is State Route 37 (northbound).  Normally on my return trip home there are aircraft on the left (west) side of the road flying the approach pattern into the Indianapolis International Airport (KIND).  As a private pilot, I am very aware of the orientation of the lights on aircraft.  This was unlike anything I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before the sighting, I noticed what appeared to be a shooting star going to the right, or east side, of the road.  Whether this has any connection to the sighting or not is unclear.  After driving for about 2-4 minutes I noticed the lights through the trees on the same side of the road as the shooting star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thinking that it look rather odd, I continued looking in the direction until I passed by a field where there was a clearing in the trees. I was about 10-15 miles from the city at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, I could clearly see that there were 5-6 amber colored lights, almost in a Z formation.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone camera but the lights were too faint to show up.  They appeared to be traveling southbound and I could not tell at what altitude, as there was no prospective on what I was seeing.   As they passed to the right of me, each light faded from the first to last and I couldn&#39;t see them anymore.  As I was looking, I noticed there was a cloud that was illuminated by the moon so i kept watch until I spotted them again.  They were no longer emitting any light, but I could see specks in contrast to the illuminated cloud.  They were not connected in any way, and were independant of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After realizing what i had seen, and the close relationship with landing aircraft, I did contact the TSA office at KIND.  They said that there had been no reports of anything that I was describing and that it would be noted.<n>

The craft appeared to be silver or light in color, as it reflected the sun and made no noise and left no chemtrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though strange, the event seemed insignificant until another identical craft came into view less than one minute later, following the same altitude and path.  The two original witnesses were then joined by two additional persons, and they all continued to watch as three more of the same type of crafts followed, appearing about one minute apart.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only difference in the three subsequent crafts was that they were still appearing to adhere to the same directional path but flew lower or higher than the originial two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No more than five minutes later, another craft appeared coming from the opposite direction of the original five, this one flying from southeast to northwest.  Speed and altitude were similar but the craft seemed orange in color (perhaps a reflection of the setting sun which was an orange/pink hue).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then rather quickly, perhaps within thirty seconds of the former, another craft was seen flying from the original north position, but was traveling southwest, instead of directly south.  Occurring at the same time, an easily discernible commercial plane was flying from south to north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Following closely behind but at a slower speed, characteristic of the other unidentified crafts, another craft travels from southeast to northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Traveling parallel but in the exact opposite direction, another one of the crafts is seen. The two parallel crafts appear from the naked eye and with aid of a digital camera, to be dangerously close to one another. (Never seen with commercial flights.)  Their average speeds appeared to be &#34;too slow&#34; for any familiar craft at such low altitudes.  This was apparent to the original witness, of military background, but obvious to the other witnesses as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments after the previous three were witnessed all at once, a dark or black craft of indiscernible shape was seen traveling from northeast to southwest, but was on a completely separate path than any of the other crafts.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the entire event, one witness was using an application (PlaneFinder) on his iPhone, which turned up NO commercial flights at the time, with the exception of the obvious aforementioned flight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire event lasted approximately thirty minutes, with no more activity observed from the witnesses for the additional half hour they remained outside.<n>

It was cylindrical with two or three side-fins (far too small to be wings on such a large fuselage), it was moving northeast at a  rather slow rate and was neither making noise nor leaving a contrail.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost immediately I noticed two more such craft in the vicinity, though they were well spaced out in the sky, apparently at different altitudes, and possibly moving at different rates.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next fifteen minutes, a neighbor joined us and we saw three more of them, each traveling individually, at different heights and speeds, but all of them traveling northeast towards the Chesapeake Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at two of them with low-powered binoculars and could verify more closely that they had no wings or tailfins, and no apparent markings, and they left no contrails.<n>

I thought it was the monitor dirt, or something from the camera lense.  I did a zoom in and saw the clear-ish dome on top of it!  The whole picture was slightly blurry of course, but you can see the saucer shape and the dome shape - and maybe wheels on either end of the bottom.  If you enlarge the photo you can also see white (it gets pixelated) underneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weird thing is that in another part of the sky there&#39;s another artifact -completely foreign shaped, like a Romulan ship (with pointed arms) in some kind of maneuver- since it&#39;s really small I can&#39;t tell much about it.  Definitely not something on the lense though.<n>

6/13/11 02:35|Erin|WI|Changing|28 minutes|I saw a shape-shifting multi-colored unknown craft, hovering stationary.|6/20/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81752.html|260|ndxe201106| I saw a shape-shifting multi-colored unknown craft, hovering stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a first-shift investment casting foundry technician and I could not sleep, so I went on a night walk up my rural road exactly 2/3 of a mile away from my home past the cemetery where my road intersects with a somewhat decently traveled highway.  There is little to no congestion or traffic whatsoever after midnight on these roads, so it was completely silent and sort of eerie to be honest.  I was alone and all I could hear was wind and the distant rumbling of deer scattering in the forests.  Anyways, fresh air usually does me in and I had off today.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instantaneously, overhead of out of the blue I saw crimson lights flashing and the object hovered and stood stationary 300 yards from me, only 200 feet in the air.  I was scared and in a state of shock, so I immediately ran for some cover in thick shrubs.  I was questioning if I was sleep-walking, or if this was really happening; basically wondering if I was sane.  Nothing out of the paranormal has ever happened with or to me, so I did not know how to react.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object started out as a single beam of crimson light as a bath-tub shaped object.  It was irregular and erratic, but it eventually illuminated and almost burst like a cocoon I compare it to.  It turned into a small orb, triangular/pyramid shape after 28 minutes of fluttering in one spot (no more than moving 75 feet at all in total distance).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its light at this point was like a beacon from a lighthouse and it was emerald green.  It folded up like origami almost and disappeared without a trace within 8 seconds after the 28th minute of my sighting.  It looked like jet lag was left behind, but it emitted a clearly amber haze in the air that lasted for over an hour after it left.  I was bewildered and headed home and thought about what just went down.  I wasn&#39;t sure if it was extraterrestrial or if it was somehow related to the graveyard.  Either way, I was frightened and astonished at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had 2 central lights, beams.  One was crimson that lasted the whole time, and the other was green, and tha t only was viewed by me right before the object went in an upward projection and disappeared straight up.  It was a single craft, and went from ovalish/oblong shaped to pyramid-shaped at the end. I don&#39;t know the craft&#39;s intent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stood still most of the time, no ambience was heard by me coming from it.  I figured this would be the best outlet to report my observations rather than calling the local police and having them think  I am a kook.  I also observed an odd object of the same type outside my window again this morning at 6:39 am, central time.  It was the same object as before, and was 10 feet wide and 3 feet high.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered and disappeared after 6 minutes and 36 seconds.<n>
6/13/11 02:00|Bay City|MI|Unknown|30-50 Minutes|Very bright white light low over Saginaw Bay, MI.|6/20/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81747.html|261|ndxe201106| Very bright white light low over Saginaw Bay, MI.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object first caught my attention because it was so bright I could see it through the closed blinds of my window.  I live on the water of Saginaw Bay and this object was so low to horizon that I first thought it was some kind of Coast Guard boat because it had blue light as well as a bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first came outside to look at it through my binoculars the bright white light faded to a dark amber color it moved slowly out into the bay randomly flashing very brightly.  It did not flash at regular intervals like most lights out on the bay, it behaved as if were on a dimmer switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it began moving back inland I got more curious because that&#39;s a very strange thing for any watercraft out on the bay to do especially this late at night.  It would move slowly out into the bay then back again several times.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This light was several miles away very low to the horizon and when at its brightest it was lighting the ground on the beach in front of m! y house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the story gets more interesting, the light which moved slowly until now began moving at high speed out into the bay, much faster than any boat could move.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up my Father at this point so he could come take a look at it also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back to my binoculars and as my Father was walking out the object faded in brightness, again as if on a dimmer switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point my Dad and I noticed a helicopter flying out into the bay towards the direction of the UFO.  The helicopter began flying what I assume was a search pattern in the area near where I had just seen it fade away.  It did this for awhile then flew quickly north and back again to near where the object disappeared. and began to appear to search again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The helicopter then flew away to the east, the UFO never reappeared.  I should mention this object was also red at times including while it was moving at high speed out into the bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was an obvious difference in the helicopter searching the area and! this UFO.  The way it changed direction and sometimes appeared to hov er indicates to me that it was either another helicopter with lights I&#39;ve never seen before or something unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The blue light coming from this object when I first saw it seemed to blink erratically, and from then on there were no blinking lights on the object.<n>

I told a friend one night that i bet we would see strange lights at his house and what we saw that night changed out life forever.  It started at 9pm and we saw 3 strange white non blinking lights that flew through the night sky in strange directions then would simply vanish.  We observed these lights a few more times then around 1am we said lets look one more time for the lights then go to sleep.  Here is where the report gets very interesting and the real UFO appears.  At first we didn&#39;t see anything and thought maybe we should just go to bed, then we all saw a bright flash of light to the West in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all asked each other if we had seen the same thing and then it happened again, only this time the flash appeared in the sky illuminating some very high clouds that seemed to appear out of no where.  Then in awe all three of us experienced one more bright flash in the sky and then three bright white stationary lights appeared behind the flash!  This flash would illuminate the sky and were owing from this disk shaped UFO with three lights at the top not flashing, and had a red and white chasing light that would flicker across this UFO.  Now the whole time this is happening, nature around us is going crazy! the birds at night are never loud and this night when this event was happening, it sounded like over 1000 birds were squawking and making loud sounds.  None of us could talk as this UFo started to slowly hover towards us at about 100 meters in the sky while never making a sound itself.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This continued for about 15 minutes then it stopped and almost at the speed o! f light vanished in the sky without a sound.  All three of us ran in the house after this happened and couldn&#39;t sleep.  We know we saw something spectacular that night and remember it to the day.  Also a strange side event was that i called my girlfriend shortly after seeing this and she picked up the phone immediately.  She was crying about a very vivid nightmare she had about alien abduction!  Now I had not told her what i saw in the sky that night yet so it was a very weird coinsidence that she had a dream about aliens.  I don&#39;t know but everything that happened that night was so strange and makes me wonder what is really out there that we don&#39;t know about yet!<n>

What the heck is that, she excitedly yelped?  High on the horizon in the far off distance we observed many &#34;fireballs&#34; moving relatively slowly, with no sound in uninformed groups of 3-5 totaling about 15.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran in the house to grab my camera &amp; attempted to capture a picture of them.  After approximately 4 minutes they disappeared.  Not knowing how to change the shutter speed this is was my best shot.<n>
6/11/11 20:30|Franklin|PA|Cigar|1 1/2 hours|missile shaped object with no wings, tail, contrail, or sound|6/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81735.html|281|ndxe201106| missile shaped object with no wings, tail, contrail, or sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> I want to preface this with the fact that I have seen this same kind of object &#34;patrolling&#34; the tree line in another area of this same town about a week before this incindent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While visiting people sitting outside,I saw this silver or white object flying rather low in a straight line over the residence I was at and I immediately pointed it out to everyone.  It looks like a missile with no wings and it makes no niose, it flies slowly through the sky in a straight line.  This particular object flew toward the treeline untill I could not see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 2 minutes later the same exact thing happened! I do not think it could have been the same one because I dont think that the original object had enough time to get back around from where it started from and start over again in just 2 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We tried to get pictures of it but they are not very clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this one went to the tree line again, the same thing hapened 3 more times!  The last 2 times the object was still flying in a straight line but it was focused on other areas, once it went straight across the middle of the sky untill out of sight and another time it went towards the tree line in a completely different path from the first 3 times.  Again this makes absolutely no sound, no contrail, no wings, no tail. Its as if it is a drone with no wings patrolling the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A week before I had seen the exact same type of object patrolling the tree line near the city of Franklin, but I only saw this one make its pass once.<n>

My window faces out to the East and I have a pretty good view of the sky from where my desk is at my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something black and shiny heading towards my house about 6-9 thousand feet up.  Lower than your usual aircraft coming in to land at DIA.  As it flew closer, I could see it tumbling over itself repeatedly and thought maybe it was a balloon at first.  But as it approached closer, I could see the sun reflecting off it very brightly and could easily tell that it wasn’t a balloon.  It started to get a little larger as it came closer and I ran outside to get a better look.  I am so glad I did that because what I saw next confirmed what I was hoping for all along.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I stood on my porch, I was able to see this thing pretty well at that point.  It was very black and shiny and was shape-shifting from a star-like object, into a triangle object and then into something I cannot even describe on any level.  But it changed shapes as it continued to tumble over itself.  But every time it tumbled, you could see something different going on, almost as if it needed to tumble in order to accomplish a particular task.  I don’t know…that’s the best way I can describe it I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At any rate, after watching this for 1-2 minutes, I watched it for as far as I could before it flew completely out of sight.  However, someone from downtown Denver should have been able to capture this thing well depending on his or her location.  It was heading towards the news stations so they should have been able to see this thing too. I hope someone reports it besides me.  Oh yeah, the camera on my phone wouldn’t have captured it as my phone is almost 4 years old.<n>

It had  pearl white, pink and orange colors and the colors interchanged.  It was big, beautiful, flying low above the tree line, going slow and made no sound at all.  It seemed to be heading toward the setting sun. I got the impression it was in trouble and it was re-powering up with the suns energy.  About 1/2 to 1 mile behind it was the biggest cargo like plane I had ever seen following it along with 4 jet planes, (2 on each side of the giant plane).  I hope the UFO made it.

The traffic was very light.  I was traveling about 65 mph.     My wife was reading and my eyes focused on an object that was hovering above the road in front of us.  When I first saw the object I would guess it was between 50 and 100 yards In front of us so we were closing in very fast.  At first I did not say anything assuming that I would identify the object as something normal. But as we got closer I shouted for my wife to look.    My eyes were locked on the object all the way as we passed underneath it.  My wife raised her head up just fast enough to see something but not quickly enough to really see the whole object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was just there and appeared to be about 15 feet over the roof of our vehicle as I drove underneath.   It was round.  It was black and  appeared to have a gray and silver sheen to it. I think it was about 4&#39; in diameter.  It was totally still.  It was definitely not a balloon.  It appeared to be metallic.    As we drove underneath I pushed my head as far forward and looked up.  We quickly took the very next exit and went underneath the highway to come back up on the same westbound side to get another look and it was gone.    I read the papers and looked for signs of anyone else reporting this but there was nothing.  I am sure it had to be seen in this highly populated area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I am reporting this now because i just found out about the website.  This has been one of the scariest expiriences of my life.  Me and a couple of my friends were still up late at night in the summer looking at the sky cause shooting stars are really cool and its chill to hang out outside.  All of a sudden a HUGE fireball shot across the sky for about 5 seconds, it was very quick and it was so big I was in shock.  About 10 seconds after it shot across the sky there was a loud screech and we all freaked out and ran into the house.  I dont know if it was just something in the woods or what.  But whatever this fireball thing was it was gigantic and i have never seen anything like it ever in my life (I am 16.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

6/10/11 21:52|Montreal (Lanaudière region) (Canada)|||approx: 1 hour|In less than a hour, 4 sightings were captured with HD cam, including an encounter with an object at ground level…|6/27/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81864.html|288|ndxe201106| In less than a hour, 4 sightings were captured with HD cam, including an encounter with an object at ground level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday, June 10, 2011, was one night sighting that I’m not yet to forget.  In less than a hour, from 21 h 52 to 22h45, I have captured 4 sightings with my HD camcorder, including an encounter with an object at 600 feet from me, a small object, but very unpredictable...<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first sighting is a surprising object that when seen far, looked like a plane, but when zoomed on it, revealed to be constantly shifting in an imprecise shape.  The only constant thing about it was a main bright light and some smaller one blinking at times.  Around the shifting body were some sort of fast moving &#34;legs,&#34; or &#34;hair,&#34; or it was some kind of energy that was emitted that took strange forms.  The object looked definitely alive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting occurred a few minutes later over the fields.  A bright intense light was first seen moving in the sky in my direction.  The light looked like the headlight of a plane as when it is facing us.  While it was coming my way, the light started to shift as if something had moved in front of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It continued to approach then turned left in front of me and revealed two big balls next to each other, a white and a red one.  The balls flashed at some times like a plane does, but it was no plane.  The balls expanded and retracted themselves, all the while blinking at times.  The red ball morphed completely to a small white object, then morphed back to its initial form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The third object was a bright white sphere that took the same direction as the previous object and moved slowly over the fields.  As it turned left, it started to pulsate lightly like a plane for a few seconds, before shutting off its bright main light, and keeping smaller blinking lights on.  As the 2 previous objects, it was silent and disappeared behind the trees to East direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After filming these 3 consecutive objects in the sky, a small pulsating red light caught my attention in front of a patch of wood at about two football field distance from where I was standing in the open field.  First I thought it was someone with a flashlight or the light of a small vehicle, the little red one behind a bike maybe.  But soon, I realized after observing its behaviour, that it was completely something else.  It was a red object, about the size of a soccer ball, and was constantly making a sequence of blinking its red light, then disappeared in the dark for a few seconds, before reappearing a little further away and repeating the pulsations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then went back and forth into the forest, moving around, slightly illuminating the trees from bottom to top, with a soft red color.  Unfortunately, the light was so dim that the camera didn&#39;t capture it well.  In the forest, it never pulsated but maintained a constant light.  It only pulsated at me when it was b! ack in the open field.  It was a fascinating and frightening sighting because of the object’s unpredictable behaviour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All these sighting were captured with my HD camcorder and are available to watch on YouTube here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhg9IjgsIrg<n>
6/10/11 21:22|Lewistown|PA|Fireball|20 seconds|Observed a bright, fire-ball suspended in the sky with 3 bright red points of light emitting from it.|6/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81720.html|289|ndxe201106| Observed a bright, fire-ball suspended in the sky with 3 bright red points of light emitting from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> June 10th, 2011 Approx. 9:22 PM<n> <n><n> <n><n> LOCATION 1  First observed: Lat: 40.661494 N Lon: 77.514793 W Altitude: 668 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bearing: 241 T  LOCATION 2 Object Appeared Straight Above (slightly to right):  Lat: 40.663417 N Lon: 77.510729 W  Altitude: 662 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Bearing: 241 T  LOCATION 3 No longer visible (obstructed view due to rear of vehicle): Lat:  40.66138 N Lon: 77.504088 W Altitude: 684 Bearing: 241 T<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approaching Location 1 in an East/NE direction on Old Stage Road, while riding in the passenger seat of our vehicle, I observed a bright red light in the sky straight ahead and slightly to the right of our line of site.  It was high enough that it appeared to be well above the ridgetops.  At first sight, I commented that it was likely a helicopter, as it appeared to be suspended and stationary.  I further commented that it could have been an airplane flying directly toward us, as it again, appeared to be stationary.  It appeared to be yawing slightly as we watched it get closer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to drive toward the object, it became apparent that it was stationary, and that we would soon be closing in proximity, that the object would be readily visible out the passenger side window.  At or near LOCATION 2, I stuck my head out to see the object in a position that seemed to be nearly directly above my head, and slightly off to the right side of the vehicle.  From this vantage point, the object appeared to be lower than I had first observed or estimated.  It seemed to be 100-200 feet off of the ground.  It looked like a fiery ball.  It had a bright white ball-shaped center and 3 points of red, triangular light extending outward from the center, almost like a pinwheel.  It appeared as something burning and I expected to see smoke or hear crackling, but heard no sound from the object, nor was there any visible smoke.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quickly, our vehicle, which was traveling at approx. 45 mph, seemed to be pulling away from the object.  From this vantage point it seemed to be at a fixed height and position and our relative velocity in the vehicle was clearly far greater than that of the object, as it appeared fixed in position.  I had to maintain my head out of the window to see it from the rear vantage point of our vehicle.  I was afraid my glasses would blow off, so I pulled my head in and looking out the back window, I could see that it was still visible and close to the ground.  At that point (LOCATION 3), the object was out of view due to the tree line and direction of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know what it was, but I’ve never seen anything like it. In retrospect, it appeared similar to a firework that was ready to burst, but did not move or traverse or explode. It was just &#34;hanging in the sky,&#34; very close to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting and experience were so mysterious and compelling that my son and I drove back from our home, a few minutes (approx. 20 minutes) later to see if the object was still there.  It was not.  However, as we turned and drove back home over the same stretch of highway, we estimated the locations where we observed the object, and I recorded the locations as waypoints on my GPS device.  Those GPS readings are shown above.<n>

6/10/11 21:00|Louisville|CO|Fireball|30 seconds or so|Yellow Light with trail of sparks arcing across the sky|6/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81727.html|291|ndxe201106| Yellow Light with trail of sparks arcing across the sky<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me and my friend were driving to my house, and along the road, I had looked up, and i saw what looked like a plane with a trail.  But the trail could have been my bad vision blurring the light into something else.  But then it started shooting a trail of sparks like a firework, and i turned to my friend and I told him to look up and see it too.  and he did and he saw it as well.  It was a more yellow light, rather than a white light.  And we thought it could have just been a firework, but then it started making a perfect arc in one direction, then turned and went upwards making another perfect ark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then got out of the house, and the sky sounded completely silent. At this point we started freaking out and considering our options.  Was it a jet that caught fire and was crashing? A new type of fire work?  But it looked like it was directly above Denver. We drove past a few houses and trees that blocked our sight from it.  And before i knew it it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The trail coming off of the light was maybe seven sparks long at first, but then it grew in length to about possibly twenty sparks.  It almost looked like something was cutting a hole in the sky with an angle grinder.  But obviously it wasn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Hope this information is useful.<n>

We kept our eyes trained on it as it descended.  Strangely enough, it appeared to get lower and lower the more we acknowledged it&#39;s presence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it continued to descend we recognized it to be a triangular metallic craft having 3 white lights affixed to each of its corners.  And here is where it gets really bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft continued to lose more and more altitude until it was eventually about 500 ,or less, feet above us.  It was DEFINITELY aware of our presence, and was at this altitude to, seemingly, get a closer view of us.  The natural outdoor lighting around this time wasn&#39;t optimal, so scant details of the craft&#39;s exterior were acquired. We could however make out that it was metallic.  The craft&#39;s lights were jarringly bright. It hovered, silently, above us at this altitude for about a minute and then silently disappeared( for lack of a better word).!  The craft exited at an out-of-this-world speed into the Northeastern sky.  We have seen strange lights in the corn-field behind our house for years, but no experience can equate to this encounter.  As bizarre as it may sound, members of my family claim to have experienced encounters of the fourth kind as well, resulting in possible implantation of seemingly metallic objects no larger than a centimeter.  Time loss (4 hours or more at a time) is also common among members of my family.  I&#39;m sure these encounters are more common than people report or admit.  I decided to report this encounter for it simply changed my life.  I&#39;m unsure of the craft&#39;s agenda, but they seem to be studying us (humans).  Throughout our lives we have had blurry experiences and tossed around conjecture.  This happened, and IS HAPPENING, beyond a doubt. (Everything here written is the truth, based solely on factual experiences.)<n>

There was no sound but a very bright light that went from my right side to over my head and was gone in maybe a second.

6/9/11 23:50|North Aurora|IL|Light|Twenty minutes|Two lights in north aurora, white to yellow to orange in color, slow in movment|6/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81713.html|298|ndxe201106| Two lights in north aurora, white to yellow to orange in color, slow in movment<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving back from Yorkville coming down oak street turning off of Orchard road heading toward North Aurora.  As I was driving down North Aurora, I quickly saw two lights which I have spotted weeks before in Montgomery/Oswego, and on another occasion right outside of Yorkville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen these lights for a total of about three times, two of which are the exact same lights/craft and motioned the same...two different locations, the first sighting was in Yorkville about three weeks ago where I saw two lights in the sky.  It started with one light, than another from a very far distance moved in a strange arc toward the other later to &#34;align&#34;, shortly after &#34;aligning&#34; one will go out or disappear only to reappear somewhere else.  This happened three weeks ago in Yorkville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today, 9 June 2011 I have spotted the same exact lights and the &#34;crafts&#34; put on the same light show.  The only difference, is that this time I had a witness, my close roommate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I quickly called them out to view what I had been seeing; to my luck, I was able to show them too my roommate before they disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw tonight exactly:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1)  Two lights of the same luminosity both hovering and stationary but occasionally moving slow from one direction to another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  The colors change from white, yellow or almost a &#34;burning orange&#34;, it also seems that the colors and light changes, sometimes they look very distant and faint only to out of no where become very bright again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)   I saw the lights on 9 June 2011 in North Aurora, however, I saw these same lights three weeks ago outside Yorkville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4)  Two weeks ago I saw a &#34;fireball&#34; craft, almost the exact same craft found in the most recent &#34;Oswego UFO sighting&#34;, the report can be found easily on google.  (An excerpt from the article:  &#34;It appeared to be a ball of fire falling toward earth at a 45-degree angle.  Suddenly, he says, the flame extinguished and the trail of smoke changed direction, rising to a 30-degree angle...&#34;   What was interesting is that it did look similar to the lights, but it was extremely close...I could see what seemed like a &#34;flame&#34; but not a flame from any fire I have seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All in all, it appears this same report has been made about five days ago.  I want to know more.<n>

I told my friend to check it out.  We have the Blackhawk command here at Redstone so I thought they may be doing a night mission.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer we noticed that it was not making any sound just a bright flashing red and white light.  We watched it for a minute or so and then making no sound it took off across the sky and disappeared within seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the strangest things I have ever saw.<n>
6/9/11 22:00|West Seattle|WA|Sphere|10 min|Orange Reddish Orb at first!|6/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81716.html|300|ndxe201106| Orange Reddish Orb at first!<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was June 9TH, 2011, and about 10:00 PM - 10:10 PM, when I suddenly saw a bright, glowing Orange and Red orb slightly bigger then the full moon rise upward; seeing it through my living-room window at about a 10:00 o&#39;clock position from a view directly west from where I was sitting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I sit there in shock I told my friend who was sitting where he couldn&#39;t see the light to come and see this light.  By the time he got up and came over to see it, the light was gone out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So we ran outside across a large covered deck and down 3 steps heading east into the driveway.  As we both looked up, we both saw this object about 1000 to 1500 feet, based on known cloud cover; in the air straight up from where were standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When viewing the object it was totally silent and had 5 light&#39;s underneath, 4 bright red lights around a center yellowish dimmer white light in the center.  The position of the lights seem to change position slightly as the object raised out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After is was gone completely, I went back into the house and called 911 and reported it the police.  They were nice on the phone, 4 minutes later the police knocked on the door and took another report and left saying there was no other reports called in to 911.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Footnote:  Other then witnessing the object was completely silent, the lights were so different then any other light&#39;s I have ever seen in the sky at night.  As I viewed them they had such a high quality clarity, as though they weren&#39;t placed for caution but object function.<n>

It had a large white light on the bottom that seemed to swivel or rotate. I heard no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it move across the sky for approx. 10 minutes before I decided to go inside my workplace and get a co-worker to see it.  When I went back outside (approx. 5 min), It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I feel this object was probably explainable, but interesting.<n>

A faint silvery body seem to be part of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first the object appeared to be fairly small and close (500 yards or so).  The object then changed direction from vertical to horizontal and accelerated east and disappeared(1sec).<n> <n><n> <n><n> First reaction was to ask my wife, &#34;Did you see that?!&#34;  The acknowledged she did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately following the sighting two US FIGHTER aircraft appeared traveling west to east.  Both jets were traveling at high speed and very low altitude &lt;500f.<n>
6/9/11 03:30|Hartford|CT|Light|19 seconds|UFO in Hartford, Connecticut.  Are they watching us???|6/20/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81745.html|304|ndxe201106| UFO in Hartford, Connecticut.  Are they watching us???<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event happened June 9, 2011, between 3:30 and 4:30 pm in Hartford Connecticut.  It was the day 150,000 people lost power in Connecticut do to a powerful storm that headed west to east with no tornados but many cloud rotations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time I was home sitting watching Channel 8 CT News listening to the load crackling of the thunder.   As the newscaster is talking the video focuses on the city of Hartford.  The camera shot is showing the tops of the buildings, traffic and the dark clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In those dark clouds I noticed Lights and a figure of an object, but these lights did not belong.  In a storm like this I thought to myself, &#34;There should be no air traffic.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks to my DVR I was able to rewind and go back to see it for a second, third, fourth and fifth time what was that I saw.  To my amazement I thought to myself,  &#34;This is an unidentified flying object.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> Check it out for yourself and you decide.  If you go to this web site<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/weather/severe_weather/severe-weather-whips-through-state#?CMP=201106_emailshare<n> <n><n> <n><n> Below will show a list of 7 Videos to be exact choose the fifth video and fast forward to the time 1:00 into the video, in the top right corner of the video you will notice an object admitting lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I witnessed a total of 6 lights at this time.  The object is in the frame for about a total of 2-3 seconds just hovering. Could this have been a reflection off the glass?   I don’t think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now this isn’t the end of it so keep watching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time of the video 1:15, lights in the shape of a triangle (3 lights) and a square (4 lights) will appear in the sky maybe 100 yards away from the first sighting.  These lights showing all the way threw to 1:19.  Could it be lightning that lasted a whole 4 seconds? I still don’t think so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyone that sees this video please respond to me.  I would love to hear what your thoughts are on the video.  With all these sightings happening now day’s will we get some closure soon?  I hope so…<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks Mr. ((initial deleted))<n>
6/9/11 02:40|Yakima|WA|Light|5 or 6 seconds|bright, white, star-like object, moving silently west to east in the northern sky over Ahtanum, WA|6/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81702.html|305|ndxe201106| bright, white, star-like object, moving silently west to east in the northern sky over Ahtanum, WA<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around 2:40 am on June 9, 2011, I went out on my back porch (on the north side of my house) for a smoke before bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I immediately saw a very bright star-like object directly in front of me, to the right (east) of the Big Dipper, below the bottom right star in the dipper part.  It was moving quickly, but not flashing like an airplane light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not hear a sound from it, which I would have if it were an airplane, because this is a rural area, and it was very quiet out at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about as high as a small plane would be flying also, so I definitely would have heard the engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light moved to the east, and went behind my poplar trees, so I lost track of it after a few seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept looking for it to come out from behind the trees, but never did see it.  It was brighter than any satellites I have ever seen, so I doubt it could have been one.<n>

It flashed periodically.  I knew it was not in the sky because it was below the tree line and in front of the other houses in the background. It was around 30 feet from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nearly an hour later, as I went to watch the storm once more, there were three of these lights.  One was in the far corner of the next-door-neighbor&#39;s yard, the other was coming from the sky, through the trees, and another was above the neighbor&#39;s roof.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Though they seemed to be different distances from me, they all remained the same size.  They were small blue orbs that flashed periodically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time I also noticed that there were at least two helicopters and one airplane flying over town - an unusual amount of aircraft activity occurring during a dangerous thunderstorm.<n>
6/8/11 22:00|Holden Beach|NC|Light|4 minutes|Saw a number of bright orange flashing lights.  They appeared and disappeared after few seconds.

At times there would be one bright orange ball of light that would appear, disappear and the reappear miles away in just a fraction of a second.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At other times more than one object would appear and then move around at velocities and speeds unknown by known aircraft.  No sonic booms, no sounds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 22:00 5 bright orange balls of light appeared in a pentagon formation all at once and then 2 other lights appeared.  The 5 lights remain steady while the other 2 move around.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 22:15 we see 3 jets approach the area at high speed.  When the jets arrive there is nothing there so they quickly turn around and head back in the direction of Shaw AFB.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We have been seeing these balls of light, on and off, for several months and it always happens around the same time of night.  The balls of light appear to be over the North Myrtle Beach area.  Sometimes over the ocean and sometimes over land.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The appearance last night, based on this report, happened over land.<n>
6/8/11 21:31|Pawleys Island|SC||30 sec|4 evenly spaced hot orange lights 'switched on' and hung horizontally for 30-40 sec over Atlantic Ocean.|6/20/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81784.html|309|ndxe201106| 4 evenly spaced hot orange lights &#39;switched on&#39; and hung horizontally for 30-40 sec over Atlantic Ocean<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 53 year old law enforcement defense specialist, my brother-in-law is a 57 year old veteran International Airline Captain (Pilot) for a major airline, with Navy service as a helicopter pilot in the Mediterranean and later as an instructor at the &#34;Top Gun&#34; Navy flight school in Beeville, Texas.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We annually take 2 weeks vacation the first of June in an ocean-front house in the &#39;historic district&#39; of Pawley&#39;s Island, SC.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of June 8th, 2011, at approximately 9:30 pm, I was sitting on the front porch facing the ocean, talking with my 82 year old father-in-law.  He was not facing the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, above the horizon, 4 large, orange glowing fireballs appeared simultaneously, and in a perfect horizontal alignment.  I do not startle easily, but the intensity and peculiarity of the apparently unnatural lights alarmed me.  I instantly wondered if they were some new type of warning flare, which were signalling a ship in distress.  However, I instantly dispelled that possibility because these were clearly pulsating lights, and not any type incendiary device whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother-in-law is a seasoned International Flight Captain with a major airline, and has extensive military combat flight training and experience before that.  As such, he has witnessed an inordinate share of ineplicable &#34;object&#34; or &#34;light&#34; events in the sky over the last 30 odd years, but none have ever raised his surprised reaction and disbelief as did his mutual witness of the intense lights we both saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights lasted approximately 30 sec and then suddenly and simultaneously &#39;zipped&#39; below thw horizon.  There had been neither any discernible ascending trail of vapor or accelerant when they first appeared, and as I happened to be looking over my father in law&#39;s head directly at the point in the sky where they appeared, they simply &#34;turned on&#34; as though someone had thrown a switch.  Likewise, when they descended, they did not &#34;fade and fall,&#34; but rather descended like the lights on a drag strip timed starter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, my father in law has advanced arthritis in his spine and neck, and even though I implored him repeatedl to turn and look at the lights, he unfortunately could not shift in his chair enough in 30 seconds or so to turn completely around to witness them too, before they descended.  Also, although I had my iPhone 4 with video and camera with me, I was so startled, I didn&#39;t even think to try and capture the images in any format, which I now regret in light of their duration.  I guess that &#34;YouTube&#34; reaction is substantially more prevalent in much younger generations than mine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Regardless, knowing the distance to the horizon at near dead sea level is approximately 11.3 miles, and calculating that we were sitting on a porch roughly 15 feet above sea level, I later roughly calculated the lights appeared perhaps 10 or so miles from the shore (although I could discern no visible reflection at all anywhere in the water as they glowed), and using the same calculation relative to their apparent size, I estimated they were spaced in the sky perhaps as much as a mile or more apart from one another, in a perfectly symmetrical, horizontal formation on an exact level with the horizon of the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still not ruling out the possibility these highly unusual lights were still only some form of new distress warning lights or flares, we watched the local and marine news reports carefully the next few days to see if any ship-in-distress call had been logged where flares or warning lights were deployed, but we never found any such reports or news blurbs.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that same night, although they had not witnessed the original lights we men had, 2 &#39;night owl&#39; women in the house were still up and talking on the beachside porch about midnight, and next morning reported that the lights appeared again in the night sky, although approximately 10 miles east from where we had pointed earlier to show them where they were when we first saw them.  On the coastal map, they would then have been closer to Litchfield Beach, Surfside Beach, or Myrtle Beach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, they also said they heard what they believed were probably military aircraft moving at a high rate of speed in the general direction of where they saw the lights appear, and described their impression that the aircraft were seeming to be &#34;racing for&#34; or &#34;chasing&#34; the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke twice via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent, experienced, and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is extremely reliable, and an excellent witness.  At our request, the witness submitted another sighting report about a sighting, together with his father and younger brother, in Rogersville, AR, on December 25th, 1969.  His father was a former USMC WWII fighter pilot, who telephoned the Pentagon, in order to report the sighting.  PD))<n>

It blinked twice and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Approximately 15-20 seconds later, the same orange blinking light appeared in the sky at a much higher altitude and at a 45 degree angle from where it was before.  Again, the round circular orange light blinked twice and it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve done some research on the internet and it seems this exact sighting has taken place in the same area over the last 3-4 years.<n>

More like a light you see from a signal from a lighthouse that is turning,bright for a second and then you cannot see it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next 15 or so minutes, the lights would show up in groups of two and sometimes up to 10 or 15 in a wide area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some did not appear to be moving, while others seemed to be moving in a straight line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Often the lights would be in a grouping, some very close to the point where it appeared they we splitting in two.  It very much reminded me of watching lightning bugs on a summer night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After watching the lights for a period of time, traditional military jet formations lights were seen, small plans moving at high speed, with traditional flight lights grouped together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very windy that night with the winds blowing i! n from the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point a couple of the group heard a helicopter as well, but the plane lights and helicopter sound did not occur until after the lights had disappeared.<n>

Initially, we saw one orange/red light that began as a glow and got brighter until fading to dim and then disappearing completely. It was a circular/sphere shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Quickly, another light (that looked exactly the same) appeared just to the north of it at the same altitude and faded away as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After several minutes, more lights appeared simultaneously in the same general vicinity, all displaying the same characteristics.  The lights appeared on and off again across about a 40 mile stretch of ocean.  At most, there were about 12 lights at once.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Finally, four smaller, white blinking lights appeared in a straight line and traveled from off shore, over the beach and continued until they were out of our line of vision behind us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just minutes after that, the orange/red lights appeared back out over the water in front of us and were brighter than they had been previously.

They came and went for about 2 hours or so.  They changed locations and formations as well.  They started out in random pulses and then went to a triangular form soon after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then my friend mentioned a light he saw that was straight up and noticed some distant lights shooting across the sky.  We saw them dodging what seemed like pulses of light.  Almost like a high powered laser being shot at them.  They weren&#39;t coming from the ground though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sounds crazy but this really happened.  All this was seen without night vision goggles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These lights are viewed regularly from the Southport/Oak Island area.  Most likely due to the location of Sunny Point basically right down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There was no sound that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for a few minutes and then passed it off as the moon and left the window.  What seemed strange to me about this light was that it seemed to change shape slightly at one point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next night at approximately 10:30 PM, I noticed the moon was in quite a different location in the sky from where the orange object had been the night before.  The moon was not full and the orange object from the night before was at least as big as a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was approximately 50 yards away from the trees while standing at my window in the house, and the trees are approximately 40 to 50 feet tall.  The object I saw shone partly through the tops of the trees and above the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live in Palermo, New York about 20 miles north of Syracuse, New York.<n>

Then formed a &gt; and flew south.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the pool at a condo complex in Rancho Mirage, CA, with my 10-year-old daughter and her friend.  It was mid morning and the sky was very clear, no clouds.  I looked up to the Northeast, near the San Jacinto mountains, and saw what I first thought was a very large flock of birds flying in formation.  I called my daughter and her friend over to watch because it was so unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw an airplane fly under this flock, I realized these objects were too high to be birds. They were also far too synchronized.  It was the most bizarre sight I have ever witnessed. I’d say there were at least two dozen of these shiny bird shaped objects.  They would fly briefly to the right, then turn and go to the left, then divide in a mosaic type of pattern.  I commented to the girls that it was like watching a kaleidoscope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They repeated this pattern this for at least five minutes as we stood there, frozen, watching and trying to figure out what exactly we were seeing.  The girls thought balloons, no too shiny and too synchronized.  I thought sky divers, but that would have been quite a show and far too high.  I tried to figure if something was being projected onto the sky, but how could that happen in broad daylight?<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this pattern repeated at least three or four times, they flew southward in a V formation like this:  &gt;<n> <n><n> <n><n> They flew in a southwest direction until they disappeared toward the mountain range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter actually said, &#34;Maybe we are imagining this.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told her that three people don’t imagine things at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m still amazed by what we saw.  My aunt died yesterday and I honestly thought she was sending some sort of message.  But it’s not much of a message if I didn’t understand it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, I started researching online and saw that others have reported formation-type of silver sphere UFOs.  There have also been numerous reports along the San Jacinto mountain range.  Maybe there is a logical explanation.  I wish I had grabbed my iPhone camera, but I felt like if I looked away for a second, they would disappear.<n>

We had driven approximately 18 hours from Rhode Island.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was following a friend who was about 1 mile ahead of us (it was a very flat, straight road) when I noticed a glowing green orb in my rear view mirror.  I thought it was a light from an advertisement on the side of the road (billboard, shopping plaza, etc.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I checked my blind spots and looked around me and, after doing so, noticed that the glowing orb was now only visible in my left hand mirror and seemed to be &#34;hovering&#34; behind the car (I say hovering because it was almost level with my car, leading me to believe it was not an airplane, helicopter, etc.).<n> <n><n> <n><n> My girlfriend then noticed me start to breathe heavy and take my eyes off the road and asked what was wrong.  I got some breath and told her to look behind us.  She questioned me and didn&#39;t look (she was tired) so I said &#34;Look!&#34;  When she did the glowing light had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The road was entirely dark both before and after this incident occurred.  I wish I were able to more accurately describe the events of this night<n>

And the strange part was, it just hovered there. then slowly went down.  Then came back up.  And then just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cant be exactly sure that, that&#39;s what it was, but I have the strongest feeling that was no plane.

With up being 12 o&#39;clock, the white lights appeared to be at the 4 and 8 o&#39;clock positions with no space between the white and red light and were roughly the size of the indicator light on the car charger for my cell phone.  I did not note any flashing or discernible movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I observed the object for about 1 minute as I attempted to drive to a better viewing position.  During this time, I stopped 3 or 4 times with an unobstructed view of the object for several seconds at a time.  Background was clear sky with a single pine tree top near to the right of the object.  As I drove west on Spring Creek Rd., my view became heavily obstructed by trees and upon returning to my original sighting location the object  appeared to be gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather conditions were clear, early dusk and with plenty of light. I did not note any sunset lighting effect in the sky at the time.<n>

This was no weather balloon!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it hover in place for at least 20 minutes.  It made no sound.  It was flashing or strobing a silver light and seemed to have no definate shape.  Sort of like an egg or disk shaped plasma, chaging and distorting as it hovered. It was up very high (I&#39;m guessing above 10,000 feet)so it is difficult to say how big it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a few pictures of it and got a quick video clip of it on my camera.

The only problem was that the sky was clear and very transparent so what appeared to be a headlight was actually an object reflecting light from a local ballfield and a nearby factory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very hard to tell how high up it was but as it approached it stayed straight on course never swaying in either direction and very smooth.  It appeared to be a flat wing or bar type object with no nose or tail like a plane just the wing part.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was brown in color almost like a weathered telephone pole, totally noiseless with no lights.  It appeared to be about 20 to 30 ft in length (way to big for a bird) but again it was difficult to judge its height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I bolted off my chair only to watch it pass overhead then suddenly it right angled a perfect 4!5 degrees then turned to the right and leveled out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought it would double back but it must have headed dead east as I lost it behind a large tree.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Total viewing time was about 6 to 8 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t stress how smooth and silent this thing was!  Almost like it was in a stealth mode not wanting to be seen, but I did see it!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been an amateur astronomer for about 17 yrs so I normally don&#39;t consider UFO&#39;s as credible evidence as visitors from another world......untill now!<n>

With my normal routine at waking, I went outside to smoke and as usual I directed my eyes on the small patch of sky that is visible from my front entrance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My home is surrounded by tall pine trees that only leave one decent sized, maybe 500 feet in diameter, that offers a clear view of the western sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After standing there for several minutes, enough to smoke 2 cigarettes and looking at the various stars, I noticed that a star-like object was moving slowly from North to Southeast.  The size was that of a smaller star that is normally seen in the night sky and it was unremarkable in its appearance,at first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having covered half the distance of my circular viewing area of the sky the object began to dramatically slow and also began to slightly zig-zag and its path began to ever-so slightly curve to a more Southern direction.  During this time the object began to slowly become brilliantly illuminated for about 10-20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The illumination was as bright as a welder&#39;s arc with a perfect bright white glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;d like to point out have lived very near NASA&#39;s Kennedy Space Center and I have seen every modern rocket and the Space Shuttles launch and take flight in person several times and there is nothing during the launch stages that can compare to the stunning brilliance of the illumination of this craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this was not a shooting star or meteor entering the atmosphere, first, because it slowed and also the peak of illumination faded to that of what it appeared like before it began to illuminate, That of a normal star&#39;s brightness,and once it decreased in intensity, it sped off out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time it became illuminated I began laughing so loud that my wife was awakened in wonder. Although she didn&#39;t see the event, she saw my confusion and excitement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen such illumination of anything, natural or man made, in our skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in total amazement not only because of the brightness of this object but because it slowed, lit up so,so brilliantly as if it wanted me to see it and then accelerated off in a nonlinear direction that it previously had been traveling.<n>

6/5/11 22:56|Lawton|OK|Sphere|~ 1 min., 30 sec.|Luminous flying sphere observed near Lake Quanah Parker, Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge, Lawton, OK|6/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81678.html|335|ndxe201106| Luminous flying sphere observed near Lake Quanah Parker, Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge, Lawton, OK<n> <n><n> <n><n> A friend and I were out star-gazing in the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge on the night of June 5th, 2011.  We were parked at the Lake Quanah Parker Dam Spillway &#39;turnabout&#39;/fishing area, standing on the pavement facing Lake Quanah Parker (due North) and observing the &#34;Big Dipper&#34; just overhead when we observed a a very bright stationary object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was positioned just slightly to the right of center between the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor and just below the constellation Draco.  The object did not appear to have any clearly defined edges when perceived by the naked eye or when viewed through binoculars (Bushnell 12x21 compact.)  The glow of he object appeared to be almost a cream color, not quite white, but not quite yellow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s luminosity and apparent diameter appeared to be fluctuating at regular intervals of approximately 1/30th of a second.  The objects diameter (when at its smallest) was roughly the equivalent of 5 normal stars, or approximately the size of the planet Jupiter - viewed when it appears closest to Earth.  When the object appeared largest, its apparent diameter was close to 7-8 stars or nearly twice the size of the planet Jupiter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to remain motionless for more than a minute (at the location mentioned above) and then suddenly it began a steady arc in a northern direction (toward the constellation Draco) then curved gradually south-eastern (making a tear-drop shaped loop) and proceeded onward in a south-easterly path, now at a much more rapid rate of speed.  From the moment its motion began until it disappeared somewhere near the far south-eastern horizon, 18 seconds had elapsed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not appear to be flying low to the ground, (seemed significantly higher than normal aircraft would be flying) though without any clear reference point or measurements, it is not possible to discern the object&#39;s actual size, speed or altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not appear to make any audible sound(s)and no discernible effects were apparent regarding; nearby mechanical devices (cars, cell phones), persons, plant or animal life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I are both amateur astronomers, experience with military as well as more than 15 years each with astronomy/stargazing.  We have lived in the immediate area for 8 and 10 years respectively and have never observed an object like this, or in this location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Neither one of us knows what this object is, but we are both clear that it is neither traditional military nor civilian commercial aircraft.  The object&#39;s motion is neither consistent with a meteor or any other known natural phenomena.  While consulting the NUFORC director, I was informed that the international space station was not visible from that location and at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather: 78 degrees F., light occasional winds at 10-15mph., slightly humid, two faint displays of apparent distant lightening occurred approximately 35 min. prior to observation of this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Air traffic:  Civilian/Commercial air traffic was high just prior to the sighting but there were no aircraft within the area of the object, at that time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE: When observing the same area the night following this observation a fast moving military aircraft was observed making 7 great loop-like passes of the entire wildlife refuge as well as the nearby military base (Ft. Sill, Army Post) within a time frame of 16 min., and at a fairly moderate altitude, slightly lower than normal air traffic in that region.  Neither of us has ever observed this kind of military behavior in the decade or so that we have both lived in this area. Ft. Sill is well known for its loud artillery training exercises, but never for it&#39;s military flight maneuvers.  The nearest Air Force installation is Altus AFB in Altus, Oklahoma, ~45 miles west of the location of the sighting.  During the sighting, attempts were made to photograph the object by the use of a built-in cell phone camera, no image was clear, the screen frame appeared entirely black.<n>

Like nothing I have ever seen.|6/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81684.html|338|ndxe201106| Bright orange, fast moving, silent object.  Nothing I have ever seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My family and I were returning from a fishing trip in Dunnville, it was around 9 pm on the evening of Sunday June 5, 2011.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were traveling west bound on a level elevation on Mud Street, which is in Hamilton, ON, Canada, it was a clear sky with only a few white clouds in it.  The sun was setting and my husband was driving and we were chatting about our fishing trip.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned my head to look out the North side window and saw an object in the sky.  I said to my husband, &#34;what is that?  That is not an airplane.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I fumbled for my Blackberry to catch a picture and video of what I saw.  The object was round and bright, it was orange in color.  It did not have a trail behind it or lights like a plane would, it made no noise as it flew through the sky at a fast pace.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked about the size of a basketball, but I could not tell how far away the object was from us. It was moving south when, it suddenly stopped in mid air and switched direction and started travelling west towards the direction, which we were traveling.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we turned to go onto the Red Hill, which is a small highway, I was able to film the object, which was now traveling south again, I did not see it change direction again as I lost it for a minute while I was getting my camera ready.  I was totally in shock and a little disbelieve that I had seen this.  I have seen other people’s video and pictures of ufo sightings, but really wanted to experience it for myself, as I am a strong believer in them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> As a teenager, I had a similar sighting but never shared my experience as I felt no one would believe me, as they do not now, the people around me think it was a plane or they just laugh at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The previous sighting I had was during the day, which is weird; I was waiting for a friend of mine to come out of a Zellers store.  I was parked facing east when I looked out my front window and just above the building I saw a bright silver object, that literally appeared out of nowhere, and as soon as it appeared it disappeared just as fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I was in total disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I find myself always looking in the sky in hopes that I may see something out there, and now that I have, I want to share it with everyone.<n>

There&#39;s a few large trees in my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it looked like a bird flying in an air stream by the movements it was making.  So i went outside to get a better look.  Upon watching it I noticed it was a sphere shaped black object flying in crazy directions then it went behind a tree.  I went inside to get my co worker when I came back outside I seen a small blimp shaped object to the right of the original object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It zoomed off so fast.

What caught my eye at first were the lights, just positioned differently than on a normal plane&#39;s.  It was also lower than where most planes fly around the area, quite low in fact.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I approached the toll booth I noticed that it was in the same place it had been while I was on the bridge, hovering in place.  As I waited to pay the toll I stared up at it, simply floating in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I got through the toll, I went to turn around so I could try to get a video of it on my phone (since I didn&#39;t want to take one going through the toll and get a ticket), but by then it had vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was triangular, and not much bigger than a small passenger plane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lasted around 1 minute, and made no noise.<n>

Two of my friends and I set our gaze to the Southeast horizon.  We saw approximately 15-20 lights that pulsed back and forth from red to white light rising over the horizon and ultimately forming an oval formation (like a circle from the side view) above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These objects rose gradually in a graceful manner accomplishing the formation and then breaking formation descended below the horizon.

At first we thought it was an airplane that had caught on fire, but the object was not moving whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stopped the car and were trying o figure out what it was, maybe a weather balloon or hot air balloon but it was not moving. The fireball finally moved straight across the sky to the left but very slowly and then it stopped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then floated straight over to the right and stopped.  It would stop for about a minute or two before it&#39;d move again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object literally looked like a triangular bonfire in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It came towards us then fell back.  It hovered for another few minutes before it finally slowly ascended up and at a much faster pace went at about a seventy degree angle back upon the sky where it eventually looked like a red or orange moving star and then disappeared.<n>

The lights went out around 9 o clock (load-shedding).  Hoping for a tempting breeze, I went up to the terrace alone (5TH FLOOR).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was roaming around there, I noticed something strange up above.a clump of cloud seemed to be following me...I stopped a while to check it out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First,I thought  I was out of my mind; I even knocked my head, cleansed my eyes, looked it even more closely.  It was REAL!!  The so called &#34;clump of cloud&#34;/UFO was hovering here &amp; there DIAGONALLY, and sometimes in ZIG-ZAG patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked around thinking it was some kind of laser show or light projected by someone below.  But believe me,there wasn&#39;t. The whole colony was shrouded in black.  Some lights were teaming, but NO LIGHT SOURCE COULD HAVE REACHED THAT FAR!!   Actually,the &#34;UFO cloud&#34; was really faint.    Only if one moved his head a bit aside, then it could be seen flying across that path I told earlier...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangely,the cloud had a some kind of a  light fluorescent green lining across its body, rather than a silvery one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing it for more than 20 mins, I was sure that I haven&#39;t lost my senses.  I even hailed my two hands at them, they stopped a while, looking straight at me, but then continued its moving or scanning I should say....<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called upon my cousin, and my little brother.  It scared the lights out of &#39;em.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then came Dad, even some curious neighbors!  They were oblivious about it, despite being educated.  Dad was startled to see that UFO flying like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He called the BSS (National News Agency) and informed about the sighting.  Suddenly, after around 30 mins or so, it vanished into thin air, as if it had finished its job of scanning our land.  It was gone.   We looked around everywhere, but in vain...<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then again it appeared out of the blue, and disappeared into the dark shrouds of the clouds above. We were left startled....<n> <n><n> <n><n> **N.B- I was convinced that it wasn&#39;t a normal clump of cloud because it WAS FOLLOWING A SPECIFIC DIAGONAL PATH,STOPPING TO HOVER AT FREQUENT INTERVALS.  IT SEEMED AS IF IT WERE SCANNING THE LAND BELOW IT.IT WAS AROUND 800~900 FEET ABOVE US (BELOW AIRLINE TRACKS).  AIRCRAFTS WERE FLYING BUT THEY WERE TOO FAR FROM THE SOURCE TO AFFECT OUR SIGHT.  WE HAD A MOBILE CAMERA WITH US BACK  THEN BUT IT WAS TOO DIM TO TAKE A SNAP FROM SUCH A HEIGHT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> (((NUFORC Note:  Correct date is 06/04/2011.

I was sitting in the parking lot of their house (I talk to loud ) and I have a convertible top and had it down since it was a nice warm night (finally.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, I first saw an object that sort of looked like this Iridium flaring satellite except for the fact that it completely disappeared and the night before I saw the same thing but different position, regardless of the object not more than 5 minutes later in a similar flight path I saw from the corner of my eye a bright flash (like from a camera) and so I focused my attention to the area in the sky and I saw it happen again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very intense flash but no outline of an object nor plane...and it seemed to just flash once every 100yards or so.  While this was happening strange things were happening to my phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First my girlfriend cell phone was on mute some how, then soon after I lost signal for approximately ten minutes in a area where I usually get full bars and never an X (usually see x when I am in the back country)<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I could possibly think of which still wouldn&#39;t make much sense if there was a spy plane taking photos or something, yet between each flash you could not see any indication of an object up there what so ever and again this flash was very intense...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to find out more or if anyone has encountered anything like this?<n>

I am not claiming what I witnessed to be of alien origin, merely an object I could not identify.  I walked out on my porch that evening to get some fresh air.  When I looked up at the sky, I noticed an object to the east flying south to north at a high rate of speed.  The object was triangular in shape with three solid, what appeared as white round lights, at each tip.  The object itself wasn’t visible, but appeared to blend in with the night sky.  Had it not been for the lights on the object, I most likely would not have noticed it.  I estimate that the object was visible for approximately 30 seconds before it disappeared over the horizon.  I also noticed that it traveled at a consistent rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am willing to answer any follow up questions that anyone may regarding this sighting.  My contact information is as follows.  I would prefer contact via email, but will conduct a phone interview if needed.<n>

We walked about 20 minutes before deciding to sit in an empty lot to talk and look at the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes of standing and looking up at the sky, I noticed a very bright, amber star in the West.  After pointing it out, I quickly noticed that it was traveling fairly quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two of us got excited, as we assumed it was a shooting star or a comet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it neared where we were, I vaguely noticed that it didn&#39;t seem to be descending accelerating, or extinguishing, as many space-borne objects will.  The &#34;comet&#34; continued in a steady, unfaltering path across the night towards the East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we continued to watch, we noticed that the object seemed to flicker very consistently, and was orb-like in nature.  This last detail is what made us question that we were seeing some meteor or shooting star.  Usually those seem to have a &#34;tail&#34; and move quicker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend suggested it was likely some sort of plane or helicopter.  My father, however, is an Air Traffic Controller, and has been for over 30 years.  So I am fairly familiar with what different types of aircraft look like their markers, shapes, and flight patterns, air spaces, etc.- even at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I assured him we had not seen a plane; I knew that for absolutely certain.  (Not to mention, there were other airplanes in the area, or closer to the airport, that appeared normal and could also serve as a good reference.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> So as this thing vanished into the horizon, we just brushed it off as some odd piece of space debris that had gotten caught in orbit or some loose ashes from a nearby bonfire (even though, in hindsight, I now realize that there was no smoke to be seen or smelled, and the night was absent of fire crackling, or people enjoying a fire)<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we were sitting together in the grass 5-10 minutes later, I spotted yet another object, identical to the other in every way (physical description, speed, height, size, etc.) coming across the sky from the same origin point in the West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This time we studied the object with more scrutiny, as we had been intrigued by the irregularities of the previous.  &#34;Maybe we’re looking at the beginning of a meteor shower!&#34; I briefly thought, as sometimes you will see a couple before the majority appears.  But it was still a little odd, if it were that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the thing float above our heads in its steady, silent path my boyfriend even suggested that the object was perhaps someone flying some sort of remote-controlled toy with a light.  I know better though, as my father (being pretty interested in aerial flight as a whole) has made and flown his own remote-controlled airplanes for decades, and our family has gone to a few RC clubs and flights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By now, being halfway across the sky, this strange orb was fitting absolutely no description of anything I had ever recognized.  It was a completely ginger-hued orb that seemed to enclose some sort of flickering light, much like the flame on a candle.  It seems to be consistently traveling at a fairly low altitude, and had a straight, steady flight pattern.  We also both noticed that both objects had been entirely silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also had no &#34;exterior&#34; or extra lights; it was simply an orange flickering sphere.  It did not have a tail, it did not accelerate or decelerate; it didn’t falter in its size, height, speed, or trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly during our examination, the object just shut off.  It didn’t fade out; nothing like that.  It just &#34;shut off&#34; like a switch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is when I started to get really interested.  No ashes, comets or stars, and certainly not aircraft!  An aircraft would just shut off like that so abruptly midair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My boyfriend and I looked at each other with confusion and curiosity.  &#34;We just saw our first UFO!&#34;  He laughed jokingly, since he is well aware of the fact that I do not believe in UFO’s, like much of pop culture, with notions flying saucers and little green guys.  I believe, being the daughter of a devout Christian and Air Traffic Controller, in the term &#34;UFO&#34; in the strict definition of an &#34;unidentified flying object,&#34; and nothing more.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, as a side note, even in 30+ years as an ATC for O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, my father has never had or seen a report of a UFO that they could not identify soon after its sighting.  But I digress.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Needless to say, I was completely dumbfounded by the objects we were seeing, and both my boyfriend and I were intrigued to say the least.  But what were the chances of seeing one, let alone two, strange things in the sky?  We laughed about it, and commented on how cool it was, but as our conversation continued it also swung back into normalcy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20 minutes later (probably about 10:50 pm, if I were to guess) a couple of clouds began to cover the sky, coming from the southwest.  With the stars disappearing and bugs beginning to nip at me more and more, I was thinking of beginning to head back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But before we could even stand to go, I saw something- again!  One of the SAME &#34;somethings,&#34; again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I jumped up, mid-conversation, and franticly pointed out yet another airborne object to my boyfriend.  This time the orb seemed closer to the ground and/or bigger in size, and the flickering light was more defined.  Everything else, however, was eerily the same; spherical shape, silent, steady.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When reached the same air space with the clouds, it went right through them, absolutely undisturbed by them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just then, my boyfriend whipped out his cell phone, and tried to capture a picture, to no avail.  But I couldn’t move; my heart had stopped.  No flaming object, from inside or outside of earth’s orbit should be able to go through such a dense cloud without even a slight alteration in appearance or behavior.  But no, it flew right through the clouds as if a plane would.  (Though I knew it wasn’t one- and even planes can be affected by impacting clouds- turbulence, anyone?)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, the latest observation made me realize that this thing couldn’t be that far off.  If it’s cruising through a cloud-layer, this thing IS in our atmosphere so SHOULD not have such a stable, controlled path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My heart began to pound.  When it was directly overhead (and well-clear of the clouds) it shut off abruptly.  It seemed to be lost or gone.  But when I spotted it a split-second later, I yelped and grabbed my boyfriend’s hand.  It appeared to be a completely black, saucer just hovering in the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It stood stationary for an instant, before &#34;bucking&#34; (much like a manual car switching gears at high speed) and then rapidly accelerating.  It had accelerated most definitely, but was still continuing on the same steady, unfaltering path, and never seemed to ascend or descend, similarly to the others.!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t know where it went or what happened to it after that.  We were running home as fast as we could, the hairs on our body standing on end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After reaching the house out of breath, and hastily telling family members what we witnessed (mostly a skeptical audience, I think), my boyfriend went back to the same place to try and capture footage.  He was there for about a half hour, and was unfortunately unable to see or capture anything else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the best of my knowledge, this was not any well-known aircraft, any comet, asteroid, or meteor, any ash from a fire...  It just was nothing I’ve ever seen.  I even looked online to see if there was any meteor, asteroid, etc. activity expected or spotted in the area for that time, and there was absolutely nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So far, though, one of my neighbors has confirmed that she saw the activity as well, but then again I have heard nothing else from anyone else or read any news articles about the instance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And, yes, we were sober, and no I don’t (or didn’t, perhaps) even believe in &#34;extraterrestrial activity,&#34; so this is not wishful thinking, or an overactive imagination.  Even my boyfriend, who is fascinated with anything bizarre or scary, was terrified- and I have never seen him even remotely as scared in the 3 years we have been dating.<n>

I noticed something floating, and glowing a red orange color,  as I looked closer at the object , it looked like nothing I had seen before,  It was a like a fireball there was a redish haze around it, maybe a ball of energy, a floating light of some sort, hard to explain.I kept on driving but ive thought about it ever since.  I would have taken a pictures or a video but I was driving and was talking on my phone, I even told the person on the phone I think I just saw a ufo, it was very strange.<n>

They moved so perfectly aligned to each other in speed and distance that it seemed like they could have been part of a same single craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually one of the lights started to fade, as it appeared to rise up further toward the sky (or maybe went behind night clouds), as the second light kept going on its course.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually the second light started to gain distance, and also started to dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, a large flash of light occurred in the sky over the second moving light that seemed much bigger and brighter than any of the two moving lights.  This large flash of light seemed to occur in somewhat close proximity to the second moving dimming light (approximately 300-400 feet away from the second light?).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred two weeks and four days after another UFO sighting the same roommate and I saw in the same town of Arcata, CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I reported that previous UFO sighting on this UFO reporting hotline as well.<n>

6/2/11 22:30|Carthage|TN|Light|approx 5 seconds|Yellow ball of light appears then fades away over Carthage, Tennessee|6/3/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81637.html|374|ndxe201106| Yellow ball of light appears then fades away over Carthage, Tennessee<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I were sitting on the roof of our current home, we were looking at the stars and watching airplanes go by over head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10:30 p.m. (central time)we were looking to the south, south east, right above the tree line and suddenly a bright ball of yellow light appears, out of no where.  There were several airplanes (commercial jets) in the distance and the bright ball of light was much larger and brighter than those of the airplanes.  The airplane lights were blinking red and blue but the ball of light did not blink.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It appeared from the south west and quickly moved to the east before fading out and completely disappearing.  The ball of light simply faded out but not as if had gone so far in the distance that we could no longer see it.  It was more like watching a flash light fade from loss of battery power.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ball of light was probably close to a mile away but no where near as high up in the sky as the airplanes.  My husband saw the ligh! t as well as my 9 year old daughter and our room mate.  The ball of light only appears for 5-7 seconds before fading away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object has appeared for the last 4 nights in a row.  The object always appears around 10:30 p.m. central time.  It generally appears in the south east, just above the tree line and moves eastward before disappearing.   Sometimes the object is higher in the sky than others and sometimes the object moves quicker than others.  We could hear NO sounds of helicopters or jet engines (and as you know, the sound of helicopter propellers and jet engines can be heard for miles away).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We (the witnesses) tried to come up with a logical explanation, but the light was like nothing any of us has ever seen before.  The area that the ball of light seems to be flying above is an extremely rural area.  The area has a lot of farm land, wooded areas and hills. On the third night that the ball of light was seen ( 6/1/2011),  the object appeared, out of no where at 10:26 p.m. central time, it hovered then flew to the east before fading then r! eturned approximately 45 minutes later from the south west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared as it had the nights before only this time, instead of flying eastward above the tree line, it flew eastward then dipped down behind the tree line and faded away.  We could catch glimpses of the light as it flew behind the tree line through the trees, then it simply faded away and vanished.  The ball of light flies faster than a jet plane at a very high altitude, but not so fast that it looks like a streak of light. It is very startling.  We have caught the object on a digital camera twice, when zoomed in, the ball of light turns from yellowish to an orange/yellow color.  It is a very bright light but almost looks foggy or dull at the same time.It is very hard to explain.  As I said before,the light is much larger than that of the commercial planes you see in the sky.  In the second photo we captured, you can see the object and off to the right you can see the red blinking lights of an airplane.  You can clearl! y see the contrast between the two.  The ball of light is much more visible than the lights from the air plane.  We are completely baffled and somewhat disturbed from this sighting. We are hoping someone can give us some answers, or a logical explanation.  I got on the internet and looked up ufo sightings in Tennessee.  I found several video clips of the same thing that we are seeing.  One video clip was found on Youtube and it was recorded in Kingsport Tennessee.  We also found another video on Youtube, recorded over a Holiday Inn in Tennessee.  The only difference between what we are seeing and the objects captured on video is that the ball of light captured on the videos is hovering instead of flying.  However, the ball of light captured on the videos also appears out of no where then fades out before vanishing.  Please help us find out what this is!<n>

A small, green orb of light was traveling through the sky, from South to North, at a relatively high speed.  The light was not a clear point of light but rather looked as if it were traveling through clouds or a mist.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The part that I found odd is that I live directly under the flight patterns of my local airport, which call for the planes to land or takeoff from east to west (as they are doing this evening and right now as I type this report).  The object was high enough that I could not make out what it was yet was low enough that it would have interfered with the flight airport flight patterns.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were no blinking lights or sound to accompany it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object continued overhead until it disappeared over the tree line from across the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While it very well may have been a &#34;falling star&#34; or small meteorite, etc., the direction and interference with the air traffic certainly caught my attention and has caused quite the commotion in our household!<n>

I was at the headquarters on Lindbergh, just south of the 64/40 highway. No other person was in the parking lot at that moment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky to my eyes was cloudy, with some gaps containing haze.  I saw an object moving in the north/northeast sky, moving north/northwest for about 1-2 seconds.  The speed was greater than a conventional airplane.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object caught my attention because of its size, which appeared to be the size of a significant fraction of the moon if that had been visible, about a 1/3 visible moon size.  Most striking was the bluish green color, not a deep strong color but more of a shade of white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object emerged from a cloud, passed through I believe some haze because the outline was not sharply distinct, and was gone into another cloud.  I did not hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not heard any mention on the local radio.  I realize this could have been a meteor just before impact, but it sure looked totally different from any &#34;shooting star&#34; I ever have seen before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent, lucid, and objective.

It also was fairly high in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw it for about twenty seconds, enough time to point out to a friend who confirmed the visual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I lost track of it because of nearby trees.<n>

I noticed that the object that I assumed to be Jupiter, was now moving in a westerly direction at a speed similar to commercial aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the main reason I believe this was a UFO, was because the light was much more prominent than any aircraft lights, and there were no marker lights on the wings (red and blue commonly seen).  There was also absolutely no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tracked the object for about two minutes until our trees got in the way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was part of the constilation &#34;the big dipper.&#34;  The very tail end of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called out several friends to see it and they all saw it as well.  One of my friends called your agency and was told to send in a report through this website.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was moving in many different directions.  It would all of a sudden take off and go very quickly in one direction and then all of a sudden stop.  It also move in zig zag motions, in circles and in figure 8 motions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it for a good long while.  It was still moving when we came in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded quite credible to us.  PD))<n>

When I noticed 3 lights coming from the East going West, they were red orange balls.  At first I thought they mite be helicopters, but color did  not fit.  As the came closer they were round and the moved slowly in the night sky. Time was about 10 pm  they did not make any noise and stayed on a straight line and spaced pretty even, I could not tell how far apart the were maybe  a half a block or so.  There was about 10 or 12 people watching it happen, I do not know any of them.   When I realized they where not planes I remove my camera from the bag and started taking pictures..  Using a Canon camera with a 300 mm lens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Simiar to car headlights.  After several seconds, the pair of lights extinguised then another pair illuminated off to the right (south) of the original pair.  A third pair illumnated below, at about 25 degrees off the horizon.  The lights alternated between each other...at one point all 3 pairs were illuminated.  The final pair illuminated again then extinguished.  The event lasted no more than 2 to 3 minutes - but may have been ongoing before I noticed it.  This was witnessed by 2 other observers present with me after I called their attention to the display.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am an avid aviation enthusiast and noted no movent, no navigation lights an no beacons associated with the lights.  The lights did not appear to move - just illuminate then extinguish - followed by the next pair lighting up - almost as if they were in sync with one another - but thousands of yards - if not several miles apart (estimate).<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was nothing short of a VERY strange event.  These were not flares, fireworks of other pyrotechnics - as they did not ascend or descend.  They maintained a constant altitude and azimuth. They simply illuminated and extinguished then repeated the sequence among themselves - at one point all 3 pairs were illuminated. Once they stopped - that was the end.  I contnued to look out over the ocean for 20 to 30 minutes to see if anything else would happen - but noticed nothing else unusual.<n>

The object was moving in circles at first then suddenly went accross the sky from East to West then came to a complete stop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then changed direction and sped back East and came to another complete stop.  It hovered there this time at a lower altitude where I could clearly make its shape out to be round in the front with two arcs on the rear of the craft which was black in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It made no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It hovered for about thirty seconds before taking off at an very fast rate of speed back toward the west and gained altitude before disapearing behind clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few minutes later it came back at about the same altitude performing similar manuevers before dissapearing off in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the sighting I heard but did not see some loud jets fly over my house several times.<n>

As both objects approached the roadway the simultaneously made sharp 90 degree turn heading East above the road, then they both climbed in altitude until they disappeared into low lying clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both objects were as best as I can describe, similar in shape to that of a horseshoe crab. The color of both was a light blue/grey that almost blended with the color of the sky. Approximate size I would judge to be 40 to 48 inches wide. I would estimate the speed of the objects during the sighting to be 80 to 100 mph. I was approximately .2 miles from the objects when the sighting occurred. The sighting lasted approximately 40 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen lots of aircraft in my life being the son of a USAF veteran, but have never seen anything like this before.

Some of what happened to me may be unconnected or parts of it mightbe.  I will try to be coherent in my time line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK first,I live in the UK, wales,even thou this happened nearly one year ago it has been on my mind now and again,I have tried to say to myself somethings could be connected other times I dismiss it as myself getting to imaginative.I myself am not 100% sure if I am just putting nonsequential events together when they are not connected at all, but some things over the course of 2 weeks were not usual occurrences around where I live, I have lived in the same area for 40 years I know it very well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ok, I was at my house on a sunday afternoon, i cannot recall the month but it was summer 2011, I know it was sunday because I was going to have a sunday meal.ok.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked outside the back of the house and looked to the south at about 3 house heights up over the next door house was a silver ball/sphere it was the size of a beachball,maybe one metre diameter I,d estimate, it loooked a solid object, the colour was like stainless steel or a bright steel, and it was reflecting sunlight,it was a bright sunny clear summers day.This silver ball was hovering making no sound.It had what looked like a band going around the center which looked the same material as the rest of the ball.It was just hovering but stationary in the air for the short time I looked at it.I looked at it for about 1 minute then I kinda thought this is not a normal object, so I went back into the house for safety.I did not go back outside,I told no one in my family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK,that was my sighting, it was a close up sighting, defo not a balloon or anything like a remote controlled plane or helicopter, it was a defined silver large ball that looked like it was made out of a metal,shiny steel etc,no sound.Not anything I have ever seen before or since in person.I have seen similar descriptions from people on UFO websites.I belive they are called Telemetre Balls?? ( I cound be wrong about this name ) I recall within a day or two I was at the same house I had only woken up and the dooor bell rang,I did look like I had just woken up, unshaven hair a mess etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I answered the door, two men were standing there, one facing me at about 5 feet away, the other person was at my rightside about 2 feet from me.This person would have stood out to anyone.Ok, both &#34;Men&#34; were immaculatley dressed in dark suits, and I mean immaculate, saville row type looking suits, expensive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Both &#34;Men&#34; said nothing,when I opened the door,the man facing me who I looked at first gave a small grin out the left side of his mouth,I guessed this was because I looked like I had just woken up,which I had.This was all this man did, he looked about 35 to 40 years of age,dark to black hair,short haircut,clean shaven,just like a high flying excecutive would look like,very polished look.Looked like a normal man in the face.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK, the other &#34;Man&#34; was different to the man who was facing me,first his suit was black,with I think a light coloured shirt,still very smart.I cannot remember his hair colour but I think it was also a short haircut.As soon as I opened the door and right after I looked at the man facing me the man to my right handed me a leaflet,and this is the strange bit, as I looked down towards his hand as I put out my arm &amp; hand to take the leaflet from this &#34;Man&#34; I noticed his skin was Extremely pale nearly as white as white,there was no pink pigment look to the skin like most white men have,This persons hand skin was very very pale,his hand had 5 fingers.This really cought my attention.Also he was wearing the black &#34;Blue Brothers&#34; type sun glasses, like Dan Ackroyd wore in the Blues Brothers film.ok.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could not see his eyes,but his face skin was also very very pale, no normal pink skin tone at all,just very pale almost paper white in colour,why this &#34;Man&#34; out of the 2 was wearing the black sunglasses so I could not see the eyes but the other man who looked normal did not wear sunglasses has puzzled me since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The leaflet handed to me was about Jesus,a &#34;WatchTower&#34; leaflet, I guess these &#34;Men&#34; must both have been american? because of the WatchTower leaflet,I said to myself after they must be Johovah Witnesses.Neither men said anything.I took the leaflet and said somethin like &#34;thanks&#34; and closed the door.I did not go back to see where they both walked to.OK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The man facing me after thinking about it afterwards seemed a normal man to me,nothing out of place about him, just a very smartly dressed man.But the other person would have looked out of place to mostly anyone, if I had seen him close up again I defo would have been aware of how different his skin colour was and also I got the idea he was more than different than just his skin colour, there was something more going on with this person,I keep putting this thought/feeling down to my imagination when ever I think about it like now when I am typing this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Maybe nothing maybe something, I guess you have to be there to really know.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK, the next day at night time about 21:00 hours, I,d guess within 3 days of seeing the silver ball in the sky,I was walking up to the local shop up on the hill on the otherside of a small mountain where I live near,as I was walking up the road that goes anti clockwise around the small mountain I saw a helicopter at low leval less than 100 feet flying above the houses that are all around the base of this small mountain where I live.This helicopter had an open bubble canopy and I could make out a man in the left side of the cabin looking down and around at the houses below.I have never ever seen a helicopter like this before or since flying around the area where I live, from the looks of it I think it was searching around the area where I live for something.OK, this first helicopter was at low level, there was also another helicopter much higher up flying a grid patter it would fly in one direction then turn back the way it had just flown.This helicopter looked like the local! police helicopter, I have seen this helicopter many times flying around as the police use it to follow cars or search for people,but it usually has a very powerful search light on,this time it did not,but I know it has infra red heat search capabilities.OK,Even higher up in the sky were two jets flying also back and forth in a type of grid search.There is a jet training base near me and I see the jets regularly so it is nothing new to see 2 jets,But! I know the jets usual flight pattern,but these 2 jets were flying a totally different flight pattern to what they have always flown before or since I saw these 2 helicopters and the jets altogether.I had never seen before or since a bubble open canopy helicopter flying very low level and the police helicopter at mid height then 2 fast jets flying very high leval before or since this particular night,within 3 days of seeing this silver ball hovering in the sky at close range.It looked to me they were looking for something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this during the next 2 weeks at the same house where I saw the silver ball in the sky and the 2 &#34;Strange&#34; &#34;Men&#34; who called round, I had &#34;Johovah Witnesses&#34; call round every other day for about 2 weeks, it was bizzare to say the least.Sometimes it was 2 normal young men in their early twenties who would call round or 2 normal young girls who also looked in their early twenties.I also had a very old women and a middleage man call round asking me if I belived in Jesus etc etc and tying to hand me leaflets just like the first &#34;Strange&#34; &#34;Men&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was always polite, but it seemed very strange to me why so many were calling at my house,almost as if they had been told that I was a very possible convert or that I had an interest in their religion or something, or possible unknown even to them apart from the very first two &#34;Men&#34; these others were unwitting tools for another reason they knew nothing about.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The mind can run away with ideas at times,but I had never had this many jehovah witness people ever call before or since at my house,it was only after seeing the silver ball in the sky, ( Maybe the first two people were men in black??).<n> <n><n> <n><n> OK now if you think what I have typed so far is bizzaro there is an even more strange things that happened to me during the 2 weeks the religous peple were calling at my house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in bed around 7am I woke up and from my bedroom window,s direction but, it sounded like inside my bedroom I heard a distinct clear female voice speaking a bible verse or something  like a bible verse,I took it to have a religous meaning because God was mention.This is all I will say about this as it was extremely weird!! I have never heard voices before or after this happened and I have no mental health history.Just so everyone who reads this is clear, I donot hear voices in my head ok.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But what was strange is the bible verse this &#34;female voice&#34; spoke was the same bible verse a jehovah witness spoke to me at the door of my house within afew hours of hearing this female voice when I had just woken up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The door bell rang I opened the door and there were two young women there, one was holding an open bible, and she started reciting to me a bible verse which was exactly the same as the earler female voice I heard recited also.THis was getting all to much for me so when the yoing women who was at my door stopped speaking and asked me if I had anything to say I just closed the house door, it was all too weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These two young women did not call back which was a wise choice on their parts because I was beginning to lose patience with these people calling at my house all the time, 2 weeks was beginning to make me unhappy with them,but they stopped calling in the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I donot know if any of the events with the people calling at my house or the 2 helicopters and the jets were linked with the silver ball I saw in the sky or even if the 2 &#34;Men&#34; who called the first time with the man with the very pale skin was connected with the silver ball I saw, I have no idea this is just what happened during this 2 week time period after I saw this distinct quite big silver ball hovering/floating above the houses near to my house, it did nor look like something man had made,it was out of place just hovering in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for reading my report it is an honest appraisal of events that happened to me....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a slow speed limit of 60 kilometers per hour.  I seen this big rainbow on the east side about 2-3 kilometers out and so I slowed down a bit to admire it.  Not alot of traffic anyways.  When I got about 1/2 kilometers away, all of a sudden I could see endless rainbows.  They didn&#39;t just appear at once.  As I got closer, I could see more rainbows in a row.  Then at the &amp;quot;correct angle&amp;quot;, I seen that it was an endless row of rainbows.  I was in awe and I was just saying &amp;quot;wow&amp;quot;.  I drove through it and just went to town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Every once in a while, I remember to look up endless rainbows but have not found any description.  Maybe I have wrong search term?  This was as good as seeing the meteor I described a couple of years ago on this site - when I took my dog out at night and that fireball or whatever it was went across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a few times larger than the largest star in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other u.f.o.(s) had three lights that did not stay in constant relation to each other and they moved erratically then moved off and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first single object continuted to hover them move a few inches in different directions for about ten minutes.  Then the other three u.f.o.s returned from the same direction they left to.

Then we saw it move to the left and chilled there for a couple seconds then moved to the right for a couple seconds and then moved back to where it was.  So me and my friend get interested and go out to this like little grass field in front of a trail to the lake to look at it. When we got to the grass the light started to come closer to us so me and my friend start to hide cause we have no idea what is going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the light reached the other side of the lake it was literally 500 ft. over the water slowed down and it turned all of its lights off and slowly cruised over the lake for probably 20 seconds then it slowly turned to the left and when it reached the other side it turned its lights back on and didn’t like fly away fast but it wasn’t slow it just flew away at an average speed.  The wierdest part about the ! objeect is it was completely silent.<n>

My friend and I were off North Custer Rd in Monroe.  We were able to see it for a minute or two. It looked like a big white light, and it didn&#39;t flash or anything, just stayed lit the whole time, moved across the sky and went further and further out into space until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We did see an airplane that had gone over as well, but in the opposite direction of the light.  The white light was definitely much brighter than the lights on the airplane.  It had a small white aura around it coming from the light.  It was either round or slightly oval, but was very high up for us to be certain of the shape.<n>

It was an intense colour of orange and red (luminous) all over the shape with no other discernible features visible.  It flew at at constant slow linear speed perpendicular to its shape.  Its size in the air would be about the length of two full moons.  I lost sight of it behind a hill at the front of my house.  I could hear alot of other dogs barking at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
6/1/11 00:00|Bergen|NY|Triangle|2 minutes|Two triangle UFO's sighted in the small Bergen village in Rochester, N.Y.|6/20/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81803.html|400|ndxe201106| Two triangle UFO&#39;s sighted in the small Bergen village in Rochester, N.Y.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sightings occurred in the backyard of my parents house approximately around midnight on 06/01/11 and on 06/02/11 in sequence with each other.   Allow me to state that these dates may be incorrect by a day or two, being that I cannot be absolutely sure they are correct, but I am certain it was in the first week of June.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Periodically when I’m at my parents’ house I would like to go outside and enjoy a smoke and play fetch with my eight year old chocolate lab Brandy.  My parents’ back yard isn’t a large one, and is concealed by a wooden fence, with a fire-pit in one corner and a dog house in the other.  The property itself resides in the small village of Bergen, located west of the city of Rochester, N.Y., in Genesee County.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Around approximately midnight of the first sighting, I had finished my cigarette and begun to walk back to the house, when I suddenly got this urge to look up at the night sky.  At first glance there was nothing out of the ordinary, but after staring up at the stars for about less than a minute an arrow head (or triangle) shaped aircraft silently flew over head.  On each one of the three points was a dim ball of light, and may I add that these lights gave off no reflection or glare what so ever, but instead had the tone of what a reddish orange blanket would look like if you were to put it over a light bulb.  As the aircraft flew behind the cover of some trees, I tried to run to maintain vision on the aircraft, but it was gone by the time I made it around the edge of the trees.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first reaction to this sighting was disbelief, and that maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me.  It felt almost as if I was stuck in some dream for about five minutes and woke up after it was all done.  So the next following night I decided to go out again, and once again I saw the aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second sighting took place around midnight as well, and when I saw it again for the second time, I knew it wasn’t my mind playing tricks on me.  It was different in certain aspects though.  This aircraft seemed to be flying on its’ side, but still maintained the triangle shape.  In between each of the lights seemed to be this very thin string of light between each of the three lights, and the lights themselves were rotating around each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have gone out every night since those sightings, and haven’t seen those types of aircraft since.  Now in both directions of my house, and I mean East and West are the Rochester Airport and the Buffalo Airport.  So being 24 years old now, I have some general knowledge of what planes look like and sound like, and I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like that before.  It hasn’t been too long since those sightings occurred and for some reason I have a very strong gut feeling that they won’t be the last.  Something inside me told me to stop and look up.<n>
