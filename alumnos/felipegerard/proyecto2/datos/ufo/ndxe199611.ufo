I left the 1986 Old Dodge Caravan running, otherwise it had to be pop-started. Before I decided to get out and look around I saw out the window to my left 3 round white lights in a triangle formation with two round lights on top and a third centered below.  At first I thought construction workers at night, as there was a new subdivision with new construction and development equipment left at night. outside.  I did not see any construction workers about or movement of construction equipment or hear any such sounds. I felt very mesmerized by the three round lights at a nearby distance above the ground level. They stayed on bright white round and in a triangle formation very steady and not appearing to move at all.  I was expecting them to move....and entertained thoughts of them moving together in triangle formation or splitting off in different directions...which did not happen at all as I looked for what seemed to be a very long time straight on at the lights.  They seemed very, very bright and facing  toward the road and the van and me.  I was too afraid to get out of the van and walk around outside toward them, although I felt very compelled to do so...my van had problems starting and if I got out, then I would have to leave the van running...and I also feared the what if...what if I got out and my van stopped running or I felt fearful like I had to get back in the van and drive away quickly and it took too long to pop-start it back up and take off.  When these thoughts clicked in my head I decided I had been looking at these lights much too long, what seemed like 10-15 minutes and I did not want to see them anymore or entertain thoughts of them moving, turning off,  following me, etc. so I decided to quickly drive off away to my campsite in Long Canyon instead. I fel! t that I had come to the desert to live and challenge myself to &#34;face my fears&#34;...and I became too scared and drove off instead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of six, seemingly credible, reports submitted by same witness.

AT FIRST I THOUGHT THEY WERE FIGHTER JETS FROM BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE, BUT NOTHING COULD HAVE ORBITED LIKE THAT OBJECT DID.

11/30/96 07:00|La Joya|TX|Disk|few minutes|South Texas migrant worker sees "flying disk" while deer hunting.|9/21/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14189.html|6|ndxe199611| South Texas migrant worker sees &#34;flying disk&#34; while deer hunting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is kind of old as told to me by my nephew.  He was working as a ranchhand with a migrant in Hondo, TX.  The migrant told him of a experience he had while working down in La Joya, TX for a rancher. La Joya is a very small town in a rural area near the Mexican border. One morning he went deer hunting.  As he was sitting in his deer blind he notice a &#34;flying disk&#34; coming from his right view and moving away from him very slowly. It stopped a few hundered feet from the blind and &#34;stood still&#34; a little bit, and then hid behind a small hill covered with brush.  He was very excited since he had never seen anything of this sort.  (He was a poor 50ish migrant worker that had never heard of ufos or aliens)  He jumped out of the blind and ran over to the area where he thought the disk had hid itself. He found nothing.  This went on for the next two days at nearly the same time of the morning. [ I don&#39;t know the exact time but deer hunting is done in the very early morning hours when the sun is just coming up 5am - 9am. ]  He never saw where it came from since a blind has only 2 to 3 openings about 3&#34; by 12&#34; on either side.  He mentioned to his boss, the ranch owner what he had been seeing.  The next morning to prove his story he invited his boss to go deer hunting with him.  As expected the disk flew by the blind and hid behind the same brushy hill.  They both got out of the blind.  His boss was scared stiff and white faced. He asked his boss to accompany him to find the disk. He said no and got into his truck and left. He, the migrant told my nephew this story because the disk reminded him of a plowing disk the type you would see at the end of a plowing tractor.  He never mentioned how big or small the disk was other than it flew just a few feet above the brushy ground. He also never mentioned if it made any sounds or if it had any colors or lights. There aren&#39;t to many hills in south Texas and if there are, there&#39;re very small. As I mentioned before this story is a little old but I thought it was very interesting.  Could ufos or visitors have a &#34;base or landing area&#34; here in this south Texas town.  Hidalgo county is very rural.<n>

I was riding shotgun. I had reciently bought a telescope and was watching the sky. I soptted a group of stars that were brighter than most and seemed to stand out in the sky. If you were looking at them like they were on a clock face the lights were at your 7 o clock and at your 1 o clock. They also were exactly the same color as most of they nearby stars, only brighter...about magnitude 1.5 to 2.0. All of the sudden they began to revolve around each other and i screamed to my wife to stop the car and she did. Just in time to see them stop spinning and shoot off in opposite directions. They were very fast, going from revolving to about the distance from saturn to jupiter (as viewed from earth) in no less than 1 second. As odd as this seems as soon as they reached their max distance from each other, without decelerating reversed course and began to slow until they reached their original places in the sky. My wife saw them revolving and watched them shoot off and return. The revolving part lasted about 20 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were able to see them in the sky until we went to bed about 1:30 am and never seen them since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a semi cloudy night, so you could see the moon in between the clouds and for some reason I looked up and I seen an object in the sky.  It was kind of the shape of the flying wing, but it was seethrough, kind of like the predators camoflauge in the movie.  It was flying through the sky at a fast pace and at a low altitude, it made no noise.  My friend and I thought it was kind of weird becuase we had never seen an aircraft like that, considering we were studying to be aircraft mechanic in the Navy and the Marines.  We were studying various aircraft engines and never encounterd an aircraft flying at a low altitude that never made any noise. I had never told my story to anyone, only my family.<n>

She said that it was only about 3 light polls up from there head. And then it stoppped and they looked at it and then it shot off into the sky. She said they both went inside and they called the Fort Smith air base and they said nothing was in the area at the time and the guy gave them a # to call about UFO&#39;s and they did. It was strange to here what the guy said. He said that when they are moving slow like that they (UFO&#39;s ) are mapping? Anyway, my mom said she had this strange feeling to go outside the very next night but, she said she was scared and she finally convenced my brother to go out with her at the same time and it was back. My brother saw it too! He said it hoovered over and then went to the end of the street and stopped and then burst out into outer space. My mom confirmed.

I lived in Bloomsburg at the time.  I had moved there in the fall of 1996 to open a new Retail Electronics Store.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My grandmother at the time was in poor health and she wanted to see my new store. Not being up to travel 3 1/2 hours to see it, I decided to take some photos of it before I left that morning.  I had a polaroid instant camera.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 20-30 min into my travel on Interstate 80(west)  I looked to my left and hovering in a deep field was this object.  It was shaped like an upsidedown teardrop or Balloon. It was a very dark gray to almost black in color.  I slowed down very quickly as it just hung there.  It was probably 150-200 feet above the ground and seemed to be about 1&amp;1/2 the normal size of a hot air balloon.  That&#39;s what I thought I was looking at, except there was no basket at the base tip of this thing.  It didnt appear to have any demension.  It appeared almost flat?? I tried to take a few pictures(still driving) but as I had to wait for them to develop, there was nothing in them.  I really never heard of this kind of UFO before, I wrote it off as a weather balloon or something.  Now I read others have seen this same black shape.  WHAT is it?<n>

I Became Startled As I Was A Great Distance Away From Nearest House Or Person And Ran To My Car.  Once There, I Continued Looking Into The Sky Where I Saw The Object Go Up And About 10 Min Later, I Saw 2 High Altitude, High Speed Jets Over The Same Location I Saw Object Disappear Into Sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a senior in High School at the time I saw this object.  I often walked at night alone on a bike trail that cut through a forest near my old house on the lake I used to live to get an adrenaline rush, Lake Minniwasta.  There is a bridge over the lake and on the south side of the bridge is Lower Gar Lake.  I was crossing this brige which is built between two points and glanced at something strange over the frozen lake suspended in the air.  It was three lights in a triangle shape about 50 ft off the lake&#39;s surface, and about 1500ft or so away from where I was standing.  I thought at first they were rural security lights from farms on the south side of the lake, but I looked at them closer and could see the horizon on the south side of the lake and saw the lights I saw were not due to that.  I started to get a little anxious and just as I became a little scared, the object took off straigt up into the cloudless star filled sky.  I mean straight up and was completely gone in less that 5 seconds.  After I saw that, I freaked out and ran back to my parked car about 300 ft away.  I stayed there for a while (5 min or so) looking in awe at what I had just seen.  Then I noticed 2 high altitude jets in the same vicinity I saw the object disappear into the sky above.<n>

It raced accross the sky and fle away into an invisible distance. It flew straight from North to South.<n>

11/23/96 02:15|Stamping Ground|KY|Triangle|8 minutes|Giant black triangle hovers over me and my car while parked on Union Ridge in northern Franklin Co. Kentucky...|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27510.html|31|ndxe199611| Giant black triangle hovers over me and my car while parked on Union Ridge in northern Franklin Co. Kentucky...<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the morning of November 23, 1996 I was driving alone and witnessed a large triangle type of UFO. The craft appeared to be a helicopter from a distance but as it got closer I began to realize that it was not a chopper at all. It was very large, at least 300 feet from corner to corner. It had three large lights on the bottom located in the corners of the triangle. Two white lights and one red. The red light was in the front of the craft as it led with that corner. The lights were bright and did not contain a hot spot. They were uniformly lit and I would estimate that they were at least 12 to 14 feet in diameter. As I said before the craft got closer, in fact it hovered above me for about 3 minutes. It was about 100 feet or so above me and was totaly silent. It was low enough that the light from under the craft was actually bouncing back off the ground and illuminating the underside of the craft. I was able to see that the craft had a flat black type of paint. Exactly what you would see on the F117 or the other stealth vehicles. I was able to notice a series of rectangular panels that were surrounded by rivets, they reminded me of a traditional aircraft like a large jet for instance. If you look at a large jet you will notice what I am refering to, they are covered with rectangular panels that are surrounded by rivets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft hovered above me and I was truly amazed by it. I did flash a peace sign with my gloved hand through the sun roof which was open. After about 3 minutes of hovering I began to think of the numerous abduction stories that I had heard about or seen on TV &amp; how people would say that something approached them and then the next thing they remembered an hour or two had passed and they are on their way home. As this thought began to scare me I reached down to start my car and when I looked back up the craft was gone in an instant. I did not experience any lost time or witness anything that would lead me to believe that this was of alien origin. It has taken me many years to feel comfortable enough to share this publicly online as I know what I saw was real. I am also aware that very few witnesses have reported any kind of details relating to the panels with rivets that make up this craft. I have not seen it again since that night in November 96. I hope this story allows anyone else who has seen it to realize that they are not the only one out there who has had this thing come down on them and hover. ((initials deleted))<n>

Dog, cats VERY upset.|11/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/001/S01689.html|32|ndxe199611| A man was outside his home for a last smoke and to walk his dog, before going to bed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He looked at the night sky to the southwest, because that is the direction where there is no treeline, and he suddenly noticed a light, which at first he thought might be a star, although it appeared to him to be rather large to be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When he looked back at a a couple of minutes later, it was now larger than a full moon!  Also, it appeared to be getting closer to him, and was lower to the horizon, he thought.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then he realized that it had become two distinct lights, both bright white.  At this point, he summoned his wife, who also saw the object as it passed directly overhead.  they both agreed it was less that 500 feet above them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not a helicopter, and it was too slow for an aircraft.  The two lights were on the bottom, and they were glowing.  They could see an outline of the object as it passed overhead, and it appeared to be &#34;pie-shaped.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> They both heard a really low hum as the object passed overhead very slowly.  The object suddenly disappeared approximately 2 seconds after it had passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The caller added that he and his wife have three cats, one of which is an &#34;outside&#34; cat, and two that are &#34;indoor&#34; cats.  After the incident, all of the them were gone, and they did not return until approximately one week later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Their dog, which normally is very eager to go outside, would not go outside for several days without coaxing from his owner.  The dog, a pit bull (?) was apparently very upset for several days afterward.  At 2315 hrs. that night, after the sighting, the dog started barking and snapping at the front door, and he would not go through that door for 4-5 days.<n>

I ran outside to see what was producing the sound and looked up in the night sky and saw a triangular shaped craft with a white light at each corner and a red light in the middle flying over my boyfriend&#39;s house.

The other doul sets of lights appeared to be playing one set would dim out and another would dim on like someone turning up a dimmer switch. most of the lights were stationary there were a few moving around slowly.I even called McCarren airport trying to se if they were seeing anything i felt like a wacco after that call,I think they sure thought i was.It was around 4:30 when i first started watching them and they stayed for about an hour and ten minutes.it was lightly overcast and they light up the clouds above them.Than about 50 minutes into it a flight of jets comming out of Nellis were heading in there direction and turned slightly and headed into the bombing range.At about an hour and ten the lights started decending below the mountains.I could still see ! the glow over the mountains from their lights,and one by one like someone turning off light switches from left to right the went out.I waited around for about another 20 minutes or so and nothing more happened,so i headed on to Vegas.As I was coming over the hill into vegas i counted 19 ore fighters comming out of Nellis with their afterburners full throtle heading northwest.This seemed a little odd because Nellis doesnt do alot of night manouvers and even during the day you dont usually see as many as 19 jets taking off at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was the first night at the manzanos.  Around 2230. My dad and his hunting friends were sitting around the campsite drinking and having a good time. I was 18 At the time. I was sitting there just staring at the mountain.  I heard some type of chanting in the canyon.  I listened for about 5 to 10 min then called Ron to come verify what I was hearing. He Heard it too.  We listened to it for 5 more min maybe. We began telling everyone to listen to what we were hearing.  Then next thing we see is what appeared to be a light.  Very small in size.  Looked like a flash light start at bottom of the mountain and began to make its way to the top.  It maybe took about 10 seconds to make it to the top. At that point everyone was focused on the small light.  Then what happened next scared us all.  Once the light made its way to the top about 5 seconds a purple sphere came from the top of the mountain and hovered there.  It was bright!! Looked like a flare at first.  That&#39;s what it reminded me of.  It was no flare thou.  It hovered for maybe 10 seconds .. It then got brighter then at a 45 degree angle shot off into space.  I guess..  It left a tail behind it.  Then was gone. Me and my dads hunting friends put the camp fire out.  And were in shock.  We all went inside our campers.  What we seen was some other type of technology.  That was maybe watching our planet.  Everyone will say the same thing..<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

This happened many years ago while fishing for catfish one night. I was accompanied by my step-son, who was 15 years old at the time. In the past, I have been able to spot satellites cross the sky. They are easy to spot during clear skies. Not sure if there was any moon light that night, but the skies were extremely clear, I do remember. As we do often while fishing and waiting for fish to strike, we try to spot these satellites moving across the sky at night. I spotted one in no time and motioned my son over to look at it...he was impressed at the speed. Usually, these objects are very small and look like light dots moving quite fast across from one side of the sky to as far as our eyes could see. This &#34;dot&#34; of light was moving consistently with what I have witness a few times before when spotting these satellites. As it moved across, my son and I were tracking it and pointing at it when all of the sudden it stopped and it took off faster than it was moving in the beginning.....90 degrees to our right. This object seemed to stop dead on and took off 90 degrees from the direction it was traveling and it disappeared. Needless to say, we were speechless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I looked up at the sky and became aware of a grey or silver craft hovering off to my left, approximately a half mile away. The craft was saucer shaped and had light panels on the bottom half of the saucer. The craft was spinning back and forth, and the only way I knew this was because I could see the light panels moving slowly back and forth. There was an inaudible hum or vibration in the air, like a subtle electric crackle. At first I thought in my mind, &#39;Oh wow, a UFO! So it&#39;s true...&#39; but then I became very frightened. I jumped down off of the top of the bus and hurried inside to tell my friends, who were sleeping inside. I urged them to go outside and look, but they were too frightened to. I attempted to start the bus, but it wouldn&#39;t start, so I just kept trying over and over and let the starter attempt to pull us up a short hill. Finally, I just gave up and let the bus roll back down the hill, where we logded against a gate. I climbed into my sleeping bag and tried to calm myself (I was frantic throuhout the entire encounter!) In the morning, the bus started with no problems.<n>

We walked into a parking lot to use the tunnel on the way home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we emerged from the trees my friend pointed upwards.  Just above the zoo, 400 yards from the parking lot were the four shapes in the sky:  two faint blue spheres moving back and forth like in vibration as a pair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Closer to us was a cylindrical object the same width of the spheres, and length three times the diameter (1x3), emitting a rose colored tint.  The closest object was a larger sphere emitting a deep maroon glow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The three (four) objects hovered back and forth independently, while their lights seemed to engulf them and be focused towards the ground at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few second of looking at these objects and being in awe the purple sphere became bright to the point neither of us could look any longer and were forced to look down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked up again there was nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend then saw nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dogs did not seem to notice anything.<n>

Flying very erratically, almost looked like they were playing tag or dodge ball. (Not staying in formation) It lasted while we drove 5 miles, then one by one blinked out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These craft were far enough away that a dime held at arms length would cover them,individually, not their formation,  but they were quite visible in a clear, night-time, fall sky. They were orange in color and moved vertically and horizontally in an instant. I called the Springfield, IL airport to report it and they gave me a number to call, which I did and left a message. A few days later, my call was returned and I was asked what I&#39;d seen again. I told them and they told me that and hour or two after my report over 300 reports, identical to mine, came in from the Chicago area. They said that someone else would contact me shortly. But nobody ever did. About a week later, my wife, her sister, my brother-in-law and I were in Peoria, IL at a luau by the IL River. We were right in town along the river when we saw the same thing my wife and I saw election night. Only this time, the duration was 5-6 hours and we also saw them flying slow and low above us (Without lights) Unlighted they were silvery in color and we could see them in the glow from the lights of Peoria. There was absolutely no sound on either occurrance.<n>

COvered window allowed spotting overtaking triangular craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This occurred, most likely, a few days after Halloween of 1996. Verification easy to obtain. This was an identifiable flight, as the pilot&#39;s seat was replaced at maybe 1 a.m. in a delayed stopover` at Reno from San Francisco where I departed. Wile I am an old private pilot, I still can&#39;t resist covering my head so I can stare out the window and watch the earth pass below. The city we were passing appeared to be very large and moving off to our left, northern, side at an angle of maybe 30 degrees.  The subject craft appeared in silhouette below and just far enough out from us for me to spot it from a passenger window.  It was an EQUILATERAL triangle with NO protrusions of nose, canard, tailfin, fuselage or jet tube.  There were no lights of any kind and it appeared totally black.  It overtook us rapidly. My guess is that it was 500 feet below us and the equilateral edges were maybe 60 feet or more per edge.  I reasoned that we were doing 580 or so and it was moving past at 100 kts faster. The time it was in my view, as the city lights did not extend but maybe half way, was maybe three or four seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

Location- Dumas Bay, Federal WAy, Wa on the Puget Sound. In your show you stated that several witnesses have seen streaking lights moving across the Sound Area. WEll back in 1996 Myself and a freind were looking up at the clear sky at night and I saw a small, possible white dot streak from North to South as fast as one can Imagine. I wasent sure if what I saw was real when my freind said Wow did you see that? I said yes and she said what the heck was that? THe object was not a shooting star, I know because Ive been involved with Astronomy for a long time. It appeared more than anything like a sattelite but amazingly fast. Also, It appeared to move across the sky Rather than coming down from an angle. We were both sure we saw Something that night that was out of this world or Radical technology not known to the public at this time.<n>

In the starting winters (oktober-november 1996), i and my friend saw an strange happening in the sky. About 22:00 hours we saw a light beam suddenly appear in the sky, it took about 1 maybe 2 seconds with an awsome speed across the sky. Then it dissapeared again. I thought it could been a meteor. But then, just a few seconds after it´s dissapearing it appeared again on the same spot it dissapeared and then it took a very other dirrection to go on. Like an angel from about 80 degrees. This also stopped in just a second. The first beam was green from colour, the second was red. It wasn´t a laser or something, or an airplane, it was something I never saw before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Report was submitted from The Netherlands, judging from the e-address of the witness.  PD))<n>

We both happened to look up in the western sky and saw round white lights at a vertical slant in a row and they appeared to be sort of jumpy and moving downwards when they all of a sudden vanished! I yelled for my older brother and before he got out the door, they vanished. I didn&#39;t know what to do or who to call. When I went to work the next morning, approx. 7am,I called the local sheriff department, and reported it, and he didn&#39;t take me serious at all. I later that day, saw it on the news and people from other states saw the same thing, and somebody captured it on video, so I knew it was real.<n>

Approximately 200 yards away, and no more than 1500 feet above us a very large, almost intimidating triangular shaped object emerged from above the tree line of the woods behind our home.  In a methodical and gradual fashion the object passed over us, stopping momentarily directly above us, and then erupting in silent force took off at an incomprehendable speed and vanished into the sky rapidly climbing in altitude.  The object must have been between 80 and 100 yards long, and at its widest point near its base between 60 and 80 yards proportionally.  It&#39;s base, which we saw, was illuminated with 9 orange lights which were bright but unabrasive, and were in a 4-3-2-1 pattern from the base to the tip.  The corners of the object were rounded and appeared glossy or metallic in material.  The sighting occured around 7:00pm on a very clear evening on a dark and rural street. After it dissapeared, my father simply looked at me and said, &#34;it&#39;s the not the first time you&#39;ll see one around here, so get used to it, but don&#39;t tell anyone, they will all think you&#39;re crazy.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
