3/25/78 22:00|Winterhaven|CA|Disk|several hours|Nine menacing crafts rounded up a large group of campers on the Colorado River during one incredibly long night. 500 Lights On Obj|5/12/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75362.html|1|ndxe197803| Nine menacing crafts rounded up a large group of campers on the Colorado River during one incredibly long night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the last Saturday night of March, 1978, I was with a group of friends on a spring break camping trip in a former California State Campground, 18 miles north of Winterhaven California. I say former because the facility had been virtually destroyed by massive flooding from the Colorado River where it had served as a landing for travelers navigating down the River. Before it had been destroyed, it had housed a seasonal general store, as well as a large camping area with large bathroom-shower facilities and Ranger trailer up on a hill overlooking the grounds. But by this year, all of that was gone, and the trailer abandoned by the Rangers but the area was still used by a handful of hardcore campers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this last Saturday in March, the nine of us were on the peak of last mountain at the farthest end of a chain of foothills that began at the campgrounds and ran north along the Colorado River ending at this last peak overlooking a panoramic view of the entire northwestern desert and river valley below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Before our encounter that night, two truly amazing events occurred.  First we experienced an unexplainable loud buzzing electrical discharges through our hands when flicking our index fingers. We could hear the loud buzz, as well as feel the strong current running through our fingers. This lasted approximately a few minutes and then disappeared.  The second strange anomaly to occur next was - the sunset we watched from the peak lasted a abnormally long time - at least two hours longer than it normally would. We commented on this several times while in progress but no one could explain and unfortunately, no one had a watch to give an accurate accounting. However, it was undoubtedly much longer than can be explained by any normal physical means. And as if that wasn&#39;t strange enough, it ended so abruptly, we were caught completely by surprise in the complete darkness of the night. We normally would have already made the long trek back to camp, a couple of miles through the rug! ged foothills, during the twilight which always proceeds the setting of the sun. But in this case, we were so mesmerized by the incredibly long beautiful smoldering orange glow of the sun which appeared to stick right behind the mountains in the far west, we didn&#39;t leave, we just naturally expected the benefit of the post sunset, slowly fading twilight, which for some reason didn&#39;t happen . . . defying all laws of physics.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once we were confronted with this sudden darkness, we tried to not let it freak us out and gather ourselves for the long treacherously difficult trip back in total darkness, the moon not yet risen, and frankly were a little more than concerned about our safety getting down - especially down the narrow path from the precariously steep cliff we were on - hundreds of feet to the canyon floor below. Anyway, right as we were beginning our descent down, one of our group spotted a star erratically zooming across the night sky in straight lines from point to point. We all began to watch, suddenly pointing to other stars that were behaving in a similar fashion. It didn&#39;t take long for the group of us to realize that they couldn&#39;t possibly be stars but must be lights in our own night sky that just resembled stars. And sure enough, with in a few minutes, they all gathered together in a tight rotating ball growing larger as they dropped out of the night sky in to the distant horizon,! appearing to settle into the river basin several miles northwest up stream from our location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Although below our view, we watched their bright domes of light wind down the river south towards us. In a fairly short time they came into our view as they appeared from around a bend in the river entering our section of the valley. There were nine crafts flying in a diamond formation. They each had several search lights fanning the area as if they were frantically looking for something or someone. As they came underneath us in the washes below, we were, of course, still several hundred feet above on our perch, they suddenly broke formation and shot out in different directions in what appeared to be a co-ordinated military maneuver securing the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Until this point, they had hovered silently down the river - but when they broke into their frantic search in different directions, their crafts gave off bright flashes of lights and loud crackling blasts of electrical discharges resembling thunder and lighting. I could feel and smell the static electrical energy fields they were creating as they surged about. I could also hear the roar of air they propelled and also the sound of the water being displaced by the rush of air as well. It was amazing how quickly they would move from one point to another - a brilliant flash light with a simultaneous crack of thunder and instantaneously be somewhere else stopped dead but for the roar of moving air which appeared a breaking mechanism.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, when they came into our area of washes, they broke out of formation and sped around as if looking for something, as this was happening, a very strange event occurred at the very same time. The other eight people I was with on the ledge began talking amongst themselves as if they were in a different time and place. And no matter how hard I tried to get their attention concerning the fantastic scene unfolding below, they just continued talking to each other seemingly oblivious to it all. In fact I got the distinct impression they were discussing a sunset lasting a very long time. I basically felt they were sacred senseless and were in some kind of fear induced manic behavior which seemed impossible to break, so I gave up trying, turning back to the crafts below which had moved down the river past us to the campground a couple of miles away to our south - except for two craft that had shot below our position inland around the other side of the foothills.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Instead of moving on south on the inland side, these two came quickly back to right below us and one of the craft shot up to our position on the ledge and hovered level with me about a hundred feet away - out over the canyon floor. My companions were still completely engrossed, talking frantically to each other, even though I made one last futile attempt to draw their attention to the ship silently hanging in front of us. It was shaped like the Bat plane - with a curved, rounded front, and sweeping back to two large wings comprising the back. The front appeared to have a elongated windshield mimicking the line of the curve - making up about a third of the height of the ship which was probably fifteen to twenty feet. The width at its widest - near the back from one wing to another - was approximately twice its height, maybe more, like fifty feet. It radiated a fluorescent reddish light from underneath that lit up the entire area in a eerie blood like glow. And I could see! equipment like or led lights inside the front windshield. There was also a gentle humming sound similar to an electric train transformer. I felt a pronounced static electrical field like presence engulfing the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a matter of a few moments the craft began to rise above me and came closer - to about fifty feet - now I could see the shape, which I described already, because of the glow of the red panels which mimicked the shape of each back wing. It was about as long as it was wide. It was making no noise as it lifted above me and it did this very slowly and gently with just the faint transformer hum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as it was directly above me - a green spotlight came on in the middle of the craft between the two red panels and I was entirely encased in a green mist that felt hot to my skin. I immediately felt a sexually charged sensation in my balls as well as the base of my spine that began to surge through my entire body. It was like an all consuming orgasm of heated energy pulsating my every fibre. As I seemed to climax, I felt myself lifting or levitating towards the ship. It wasn&#39;t like I was being pulled, as much as I was being energized to a float on my own - like my molecules were being manipulated by an internally-produced, stimulating force. The last thing I saw at this point was looking down on my friends still talking manically amongst themselves as I floated upward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  However, the last Saturday in March 1978 was March 25.  PD))<n>
3/21/78 04:00|Medford|OR|Disk|7 or 8 mins|Inflight formation with two disk|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68641.html|2|ndxe197803| Inflight formation with two disk<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m currently a 25,000 hour pilot (2009), but on March 21, 1978 I only had around 5,000 hours.  I have reported this incident to Dr Haines and Dr. Friedman, no one else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was flying an Aero Commander 680, on a the last leg of the day on a freight run from Klamath Falls, OR to Medford, OR at about 4am.  I had climbed to an altitude of 15,000 feet on this night in order to top icing conditions resulting from a fast moving cold front that was at that time about half way between the two cities.  I had a passenger with me sitting in the copilots seat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 15 miles from the Medford VOR, I broke out the side of clouds into a perfectly clear rain washed sky, with full moon setting on the horizon ahead.  This of course, left me very high for landing at Medford...so I canceled my IFR flight plan and headed directly to the airport, arriving there at an altitude above 8,000 feet where I began circling to descend for the traffic pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was passing about 7,000 feet, I was circling to the left over the airport on a southeasterly heading when I noticed what looked to me like the landing light of a relatively slow moving aircraft flying in the opposite direction.  I called the tower and asked if they had other traffic in the area, they said they did not, I was not too surprised to hear that in as much as we were both above the towers airspace so contact was not required.  As we passed abeam each other at about the same altitude and within about one mile, the craft silhouetted against the full moon on the western horizon, when I could see that the craft had no tail and a light on the back as bright as the one on the front that I originally thought was a landing light.  Thinking this was unusual, I turned toward the craft, to the right.  As I turned the craft, also turned to the right and accelerated.  When I started the turn, I was southeast bound, as I turned steeper and steeper to keep the craft in sight, it continued to accelerate in a turning arc about 2 miles out side my turn until I lost sight of it over the top of the aircraft, then in about a 60 degree banked turn then headed to the northeast.  I continued the turn all the way around to a northwesterly heading when I rolled out, not having caught sight of the craft again in the turn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after rolling out of the turn heading to the northwest....two flying disc pulled up on my left wing, no more than ten feet off my wing tip and perhaps 5 feet higher, where we flew together in formation for perhaps 15 to 20 seconds.  The furthest one was lit slightly ahead of the nearest one which was not lit.  The lights of the city were shining up from the ground in the rain washed air.  I could not see much detail on the lighted craft due to the bright lights on the front and back, but I could see good detail on the nearer one, both craft appeared to be the same.  They were disc shaped, white or light gray in color and I could see what looked like scotch marks on the bottom. The were about the same diameter as the wing span of the Aero Commander or about 55 to 60 feet across.  I could not see any openings of any kind in either of the craft and could not hear any sounds from the craft over the sound of the planes engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was flying at about 160 knots, after the 15 or 20 seconds of formation flying the two craft accelerated to about 190 knots and pulled out in front of us about 2 miles when they instantaneously accelerated to a streak of light heading into space.  I looked over to my passenger, who was a little white in color....I&#39;m not sure if he was sick from the high G turn or stunned at what we has just witnessed.  After we landed it took a couple of minutes to get him out of the plane.  I saw him about 5 years later, he still did not wish to talk about it.  As this was occurring I was telling the tower these events as they happened, who never did see the craft....I can not understand why.<n>

Two objects seen up close. One hovered over our home, the other flew over at just above treetop level.  A third was seen in the distance as a red light falling from one of the craft to the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband, myself, and our 2 sons, ages 2yrs, and 1 year old were moving into our new house on March 17th, 1977.  I remember the date clearly because it was my younger sons 1 year old birthday.  I was in the house unpacking with my 1 year old, and my husband and older son were outside getting things from the truck.  It was dark by this time, but we had the porch lights on.  This was in the sante fe area of Denver, Colorado, which is a fairly heavily populated area of Denver. At approximately 7:30 pm, my husband came running into the house, and yelling my name.  He was very agitated, and nearly speechless,and he just kept saying my name while dragging me out to the back side of the house. I would say no more than 30 seconds had past between him racing into the home, and he and I going back outside.  When I got out there he began to tell me what had happened to him.  He said he was bending down in the cab of the truck to retrieve a box when it lit up like someone had placed a powerful flashlight over his shoulder.  He looked over his shoulder and saw a craft hovering, with no sound, right at treetop level over our home.  It had ice cube shaped lights on it, which were flashing in a circular movement around the object.  The craft itself was spherical in shape.  As soon as he saw it, he raced in the house to get me.  My 2 year old was left outside by himself, and he has no memory of the event. By the time I came outside, the object was in the distance, and it looked like a very large, bright star to me.  I had jumped up on the cab of the truck for a better look, and began to search the sky.  As I looked up and behind me, I saw another craft that was very low to the ground flying right over my head.  It was higher than treetop level, but not by much.  This craft was triangular, had 3 very large amber colored lights on the bottom of it.  It was close enough that I was able to make out some of the mechanical lines of the craft on its bottom part.  There was no sound at all, and it just drifted past.  I watched it until I could not make it out anymore. The other craft (the first one spotted) had now appeared to stop and hover over the far mountains.  It was blinking, and then appeared to change shape and color.  It went from white, to gold, to pale red, and changing shapes.  It was too far away to tell the exact shapes, but it did not stay spherical.  Then a round, very bright red light seemed to drop from it, and float to the ground, leaving a trail as it did. The main craft then turned bright white and circular again, and moved off toward Boulder, CO. We watched it until we couldn&#39;t make it out anymore. Approximately 3 to 5 minutes later, a number of helicopters and planes we suspected were military buzzed around our home.  They searched the area for about 5 minutes, then moved off. There were several cars that had stopped by our home, gotten out of their cars and watched the crafts as well.  We talked with them, but did not get their names.  I have never reported this incident until now.  The main reason I am, is to see if your organization got any other reportings of this event.<n>

I opened the door, and she indicated that I follow her.  Once outside, I heard the horses in our pasture, and the cattle across the road just going nuts with fear, and all of the outside neighborhood dogs barking.  My dog was looking straight up, snarling, and had her fangs bared.  I looked up and saw a single green light.  I watched it for just a few seconds, then I looked down and said to my dog: &#34;I certainly hope you are seeing what I am seeing&#34;.  When I looked back up, the light was gone, the horses and dogs in the area were then quiet.  You have to understand that at that time, this was a very rural area.  The next day, I questioned a couple of neighbors, and none of them had heard anything.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was unable to determine how close this light was, there were no reference points, and there was absolutely no sound but for the animals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When she pointed at this object with her eyes and mouth wide open it had almost a hypnotic effect on you. Estimates on it&#39;s size are difficult but the main feature of this object was the different colors that consistenly evolved around it. There was red white yellow and i believe blue as well.I have two semi different recollections in terms of the shape of the object. One being flat as a pancake and the other changing as a larger craft as the evolving lights became larger. The movements of the lights could be compared to a light house or even a siren. We wathched the object for at least 15 minutes in complete amazment<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; source is anonymous.  PD))<n>

I was driving a 1966 Dodge Dart and pulled into my driveway, which was due North. As we got out of the car, my friend said with great emphasis &#34;what the (bleep) is that&#34;. I looked up into a cloudless night sky and at an altitude of about one to two thousand feet above us, at a distance of perhaps five miles, was a transluscent orb of oval shape travelling horizontal to the ground at an extraordinary rate of speed. Within moments the orb then banked downward and then shot straight up into a cloudless night sky and accelerated to a rate beyond the realm of aviation that I was aware of and then blinked once and disappeared. The entire event took less then fifteen seconds. It was clearly not a vessel that either of us had ever seen before and, in fact, did not appear to be a vessel at all but a kind of &#34;angelic&#34; or &#34;celestial&#34; plasma. It did not hurt our eyes to look at it and seemed to operate with intelligence and trajectorical intent. The acceleration of the orb was in the realm of the miraculous and caused us both to question what we had seen, or if we had indeed experienced this at all. My friend then said to me &#34;We didn&#39;t see that&#34; and to this day has not spoken of the event at all. I, however, continue to be informed and changed by it to this day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say this UFO experience was more of an &#34;Angelic&#34; witnessing rather than an aviation event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was a full moon and my parents lived out in the rural part of town.  I started yelling for my Dad to come out.  When I started yelling for him,  the thing took off so fast.  It was gone before I knew it.  It was a full moon, no clounds.  I have never seen anything like it since it happened.  I do know the difference between a aircraft, ballon(weather).  Helicopter.

A group of us from the same Department were on a recreational basketball team that played in the evenings.  As we stood in the parking lot on a very cold night, talking, all 9 of us saw:  Approaching from the South, an area of sky that was dark, meaning the stars were covered by an object.  It was low in the sky, moving very slowly.  As it came closer we could all see it was a huge triangular shaped object, wider than it was long, similar to a B-2 bomber, but much larger.  I estimate it was at least 100 yards from &#34;wing&#34; tip to &#34;wing&#34; tip, and about 25 yards long.  There was no light of any type, just the obvious blotting out of the night sky, which was full of stars in our small town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it came directly overhead, and slightly East of our location, the most blatant thing that stood out was the lack of any sound from the object.  I estimate its altitude at 500-1000 ft.  Even as it slowly passed, and continued north, there was no sound at all, and no lights.  While we had barely said a word while it was in sight, we all started talking about it, comparing details.  We all agreed that, due to the very slow speed, and lack of sound at its low height, that it was not an aircraft.   (Our small town was on Victor 32, an airliner &#34;freeway&#34; from California to Seattle, and we had all seen and heard a lot of aircraft before.)  As we were all cops, we more or less agreed to not talk about, for fear of being ridiculed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The area became intersection became very dark, and traffic and street light went out. I pulled over into an empty parking lot near a building, wondering what it was and get a better look. A doomed shaped object came in at impossible speeds (no sound at all) and hovered directly in front of where I was and hovered motionless above the building. The center rotated and was lit from the inside. I felt that I was being watched. To my suprise there were tall figures dressed in what appeared to be blue jumpsuits. All were very alike with shoulder length yellow hair. I could see into the craft and it appeared that they were aware that I was there and looked out of clear widows that made up the middle portion of the craft (which rotated. The underside of the craft was lit with bright white lights. Then it shot up at lighting speed, again without any sound and streaked off as it accelerated to nothing more than a pin point of light and disapeared. I went down the nearest street, but it had vanished and was gone. I considered going to the police to report it and actually started to do this, but decided no one at all would believe me. This was a friday pm est, and on the next Tuesday on the car radio there was a news report that over norther Michigan there had been sightings  ufo&#39;s and the description match exactly what I had seen just a few evenings before. I am a professional person with advanced degrees, and have only talked about this with family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness chooses to remain anonymous.

Standing on my driveway in the rustic Los Gatos Foothills with my younger brother (9 at the time) and neighbor (16 at the time).  We were talking... then both of their mouths fell open.  I turned to see what was going on.  A large elipsoidal object (about the size of a 1/4 mile running track oval was hovering toward us (very slowly) just above the sycamore trees (approx. 150 feet).  We all stood in silence and awe for a minute as the object moved almost directly over head. I ran into my house to get a camera.  Here&#39;s where it gets weird... .  I asked my mother for a camera (we had two olk kodak&#39;s in a drawer) and she forgot where they were (my mother knows exactly where everything is in her house, she&#39;s meticulous like that)  I went to the drawer where the cameras were and pulled one out.  My mother stopped me saying she didn&#39;t know if it had film in it.  I thought it did and took it and ran through the house to go outside.  (It gets weirder now)  I ran through the television room where my father was watching a rerun of Gilligan&#39;s Island (he never watches the show, doesn&#39;t like it much, BUT it was MY FAVORITE SHOW)  I had the thought that the object/UFO was now gone and sat down to watch the show (which I had seen many times before).  When the show ended... I saw that I had a camera in my hand and couldn&#39;t figure out why.  I thought hard and knew that there was something &#34;really important&#34; that I was forgetting.  I remembered the UFO and a wave of terror came over me.  I ran outside to see if it was still there. I found my younger brother and neighbor exactly where I had left them.  Only now they had been joined by two other neighborhood kids (I believe 18 and 19 years old at that time).  The UFO was no longer there.  I asked where it went.  They asked &#34;where did what go?&#34;  I said, &#34;The UFO, where did it go?&#34;.  They said &#34;oh, that, it took off real fast, but that was a while ago&#34; (all four of them saw it leave). I find it odd that they shrugged it off as if it was no big deal. A few years later I was with my mother in a local shopping mall.  I went into a bookstore to find her.  The book &#34;Communion&#34; had just come out and wsa displayed in the store.  I literally was scared for my life when I saw the cover... I was terrified that the alien on the cover was going to kill me.  Now, I&#39;d never seen a picture of a Grey up to that point in my life.  And I had no idea that it was an alien.  Non-the-less, I ran out of the bookstore and sat outside for 1/2 an hour scared to go back in and see the image of the alien. Was I abducted?  I don&#39;t know. All I know is I saw that UFO (or at least something without wings or propellers)  when I was a kid.  And I was terrified of the picture on a book cover.<n>
