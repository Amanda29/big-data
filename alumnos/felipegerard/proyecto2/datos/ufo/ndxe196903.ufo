I remember it being cigar shaped, about 150 to 200 feet long and about 50 ft in diameter, as we all turned to look, i know that everyone but me looked frozen in place, i couldn&#39;t move but was completely aware of the scene. i have no idea of how much time past, but just like it happened at first, everyone looked frozen stiff, no there was any ice just unmoving,the craft disappeared and the others went back to what they where doing,i asked them what that thing was and they all had no idea what i was talking about even laughed at me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some point days later i noticed a circular purplish spot on my left inside ankle,approx. 3/8 diameter, being than young i gave it no concern.  I have received 4 more of these in different locations on my body over the yrs, several doctors have seen them and do not have any idea what made them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Went from very fast to full stop above us. Went silent then reved up and moved away slowly.UFO was 3 to 4 ft long and above me and my father about 15ft.  Came back one year later at near same time.  My brother was home alone and heard the chickens going crazy, looked out and saw a shadow circling on the ground.  He went outside with a 22 rifle to get what he thought was a Hawk.  Said he was on a hill and the hair stood up on his neck, he felt like he was being watched, he then looked up and saw it 4 to 5 ft away from him. It was never seen again<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/1/69 21:00|Perth Amboy|NJ|Light|2 minutes|While observing Venus through telescopes, my friend and I saw several lights at high altitude that were able to come to complete stops,|6/20/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44231.html|3|ndxe196903| While observing Venus through telescopes, my friend and I saw several lights at high altitude that were able to come to complete stops,<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I was 13 years old, a friend of mine and I had our telescopes out to view the planet Venus, as it was in close proximity to the earth during that period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There had been reports of UFO sightings in the Perth Amboy area for several days before this.  These events were even reported in a local newspaper.  My friend and I laughed about these reports as we both thought the poor ignorant fools were actually witnessing Venus and didn&#39;t know any better.  We were a bit cocky since we had a little knowledge of astronomy, and we were young.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Several minutes into our observing Venus, my friend said to me, what&#39;s that?  I looked up and saw two small lights moving in a northerly direction toward us, side by side, and about to move directly over my (parents) house. Since we lived in the flight path of Newark airport, I thought the lights were the wing lights of an airliner, and I said to my friend, it&#39;s just a plane, why?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then went back to looking through my telescope.  My friend, who was older then me and a very intelligent kid, said, &#34;but there&#39;s no plane in the middle&#34;.  I thought that was a silly thing for him to say, and I then looked back up.  Sure enough he was right; there was no plane in between the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now we just kept looking up at these small moving lights, not sure what they were, but not thinking UFO&#39;s.  We were just curious as to what aircrafts would be traveling so high up (20,000 feet or more), next to each other in this way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were almost directly overhead, one of the lights came to a complete stop while the other light made a 45 degree turn around it and then both lights started to travel easterly, at a right angle from their original path.  This was absolutely shocking since there were no crafts either of us had ever heard of that could do such a thing.  We were stunned into silence as we watched the small lights continue their new easterly path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few more seconds both lights stopped altogether, at a point that a small star was between them (we thought it was a star).  The two lights turned around this star in such a manner as to resume their original configuration as they had been when they were traveling northerly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point all three lights started to move north together!  Obviously, the center light was not a star, but it was another craft that had been waiting for the other two crafts (lights).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Up to this point my friend and I didn&#39;t say a word, we just watched in sheer, silent amazement.  As the lights traveled north toward Newark airport, we started to talk to each other and ask, what did you see?   Neither of us has ever been able to explain the event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I do not believe that the earth is being visited by aliens, simply because of the incredible distances and time involved in traveling from solar system to solar system.  However, I do not know how to explain what we saw that day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
3/1/69 15:00|Oak Lawn|IL|Disk|30 Min|2 Large UFOs seen by my brother and his driving instructor|1/19/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/041/S41197.html|4|ndxe196903| 2 Large UFOs seen by my brother and his driving instructor<n> <n><n> <n><n> My Brother was taking his driving lession when he was 18 years old along with a driving instructor. They were heading southwest from Chicago to Oak Lawn (a suburb of Chicago) While they were driving down on Cicero Ave. all of a sudden everyone had stopped their vehicals; just to look up in the sky. There were two huge saucers disk shape like, as they were hoovering over side by side on Cicero Ave. My brother had ask his driving instructor &#34;What the heck is going on?&#34; nobody seems to know what to make of this? but the people who were involved with this un explained event, must had a good story to  tell to their love ones that day.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

3/1/69 00:00|Omaha|NE|Oval|thirty seconds|Football shaped glowing orange light drifts straight across sky, west to east,  to the top of a very tall TV tower and then disappears|12/12/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84875.html|5|ndxe196903| Football shaped glowing orange light drifts straight across sky, west to east,  to the top of a very tall TV tower and then disappears<n> <n><n> <n><n> Orange &#34;football&#34; shaped light drifts west to east across the night sky towards a TV tower. The orange light goes out when it appears to touch the top of the TV tower  Date: February or March 1969 (approximate; certainly between Feb 1 and May 1 of 1969)  Time: Near Midnight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location; West suburbs of Omaha, Douglas County, Nebraska, USA  Visibility: Very Good, crystal clear atmosphere on the ground and up to the cloud base. Overcast sky with very high ceiling providing an opaque, starless, moonless background.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Situation: Omaha, Nebraska has three very tall TV transmission towers on a hill on North 72nd Street and Crown Point Drive.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These towers are about 1200 feet in height from base to the top. They are situated on one of the highest hills in the Omaha area, between Military Ave. ( a north-west to south-east diagonal street) on the south,  and Crown Point Drive (an east-west running street) on the north, with North 72nd Street (a north-south running street) immediately to the east.  The towers are arranged in a more or less North - South line. They are each about 600 feet apart, so the south tower is a total of about 1200 feet from the north tower. The middle tower is offset to the east about 200 feet, though most people think the  three towers look to be in a straight north - south line with each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Line of sight: Clear, unobstructed view. My line of sight with the towers was almost exactly 45 degrees south-west to the north-south running line up of the towers. I was almost exactly six miles due south-west from the towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Distance: I was almost exactly six miles due south-west from the TV Towers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size of “UFO” , my guess, explained below, is that the UFO was somewhere between 50 to 100 feet long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shapw: It was shaped like an American football; strongly pointed at both ends and completely symmetrical. As it traveled the pointed ends were front and rear. It traveled in a very flat, straight horizontal line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Appearance: The UFO was shaped like an American football. It was a bright, glowing, uniform orange color; much the color of true neon light (not “florescent” neon colors). It glowed steadily with no pulsation or variation in brightness or color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving North on 132nd Street (a north-south running street), just north of Pacific Street (an east-west running street) traveling slightly up hill. That hill on 132nd St. crests just a few hundred yards north of the Pacific Street intersection. As I crested the rise I could clearly see the three towers as outlined by their red blinking warning lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was intimately familiar with this stretch of road as I grew up very near there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again; I was driving and looking due north. I had to look to the right to see the towers as I crested the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw something I’d never seen before. A small orange light the shape of an American football was slowly drifting from west to east towards the towers. The “football” was moving in a perfectly flat horizontal line and the long axis of the “football” was horizontal, like a football would be if being thrown. To me it looked just like an orange neon light in both color and the way it glowed; very fascinating and pleasant to look at, neither too bright nor too dim.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I laughed as reminded me of a florescent orange Nerf Football, though it truly was illuminated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This orange glowing “football” was traveling in a perfectly flat horizontal line, and apparently from my position,  headed directly towards the top-most tip of the northern most TV tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As there were no other cars on the road, I stopped the car and turned off the headlights leaving only the parking lights on, so as to minimize any extraneous light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there watching this “football” for probably no more than 30 seconds (certainly less than a minute.) until it, apparently from my view point, drifted right up to where the leading tip of the “football” touched the top tip of the north TV tower and then it (the “football”) blinked out, went dark, never to reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This left no visible outline. It was as if the “football” just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat there for probably an additional five minutes waiting to see if the “football” would reappear, but it did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was NO effect to the TV towers. The red safety lights on all three towers continued to blink normally the whole time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was NO flash when the &#34;football&#34; touched the tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orange glow of the &#34;football&#34; never varied, never pulsed; it simply went out when it touched the tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was absolutely fascinated by this and not the least bid frightened or disturbed, but then again, it appeared to be a fairly long way off from me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, granting that I was six miles from the TV towers and it was night, so all I could see were the blinking red safety lights on the towers and the constant orange glow of the “football”, I cannot say for certain how the “football” actually lined up with the TV towers or where it actually was physically with relation to the towers; BUT, from my vantage point it appeared that the “football” was at the very same altitude as the top of the north tower and that the “football” drifted right up to the top tip of the north tower and then went dark when it “touched” the tip of the tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having said the above; if the “football” actually did touch the top of the tower, and then gauging its size in proportion to the tower, I would say that the horizontal length of the “football” would have been between 50 (fifty) to 100 (one hundred) feet in length.<n>
