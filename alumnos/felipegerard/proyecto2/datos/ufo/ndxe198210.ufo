No sound.|10/10/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/083/S83466.html|1|ndxe198210| Older sister and I witnessed 3 orange, glowing, bell shaped shaped objects in northern sky.  No sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have a very vivid memory during my childhood of an occurrence in the early 80’s. I remember the date OCT 31, Halloween (1982 or 83), because at the time it was an important holiday for a child age 7-8.  Within 5 minutes of leaving my house (6:30 pm) to get an early start on “trick or treating”, I noticed what appeared to be 3 orange balloons in the northern sky above a field.  I told my sister, who’s 2 yrs. my senior, to “ look at the orange Halloween balloons”.  Upon second glance, they came into sharp focus as 3 bright orange, glowing, bell-shaped objects approx. 1 mile north of our location heading east at a medium-slow speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These were not balloons by any means, but glowing, mechanical, craft not like anything military or commercial.  After discussing this with my sister, we agreed these were something extraordinary.  Based on the speed and direction we looked up at the sky where they should’ve been and they were completely gone.  Vanished. I have not seen anything similar before or after that event, but I still discuss it with her every few years.  Had I saw it only by myself at that age, I may have disregarded it as an illusion.  But the fact that my older sister was there to witness it and still testify it as fact, makes me realize what we saw was a group of UFO’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I watch the planes come over us all the time.  Well, I noticed a black tiny version of a plane.  Had wings just like a jet real high but quiet and didn&#39;t leave that trail of smoke at all.  The sky was clear and I watched this plane go through a tiny cloud and disappear!  Seconds later a tiny green light came out of the cloud and flew the other way slowly then disappeared.  This was unbelievable because the clouds were tiny patches and the rest of the sky was clear.  There&#39;s No way that wasn&#39;t a ufo unless we have solid black jets that in a second can transform into some tiny green light craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

The object appeared above the tree line toward us then just hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t remember how long we stood there, maybe 20 minutes.  The craft was very large, say 2 football fields and was just above the trees.  The bottom of the craft had a number of small colored lights, like an electronic board would have.  Several white, amber, some red and then a few green and blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only other description would be like an engine.  There was no noise when it approached.

It passed overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting this on behalf of my grandpa, who has related this sighting several times and is serious whenever he states it. He has given permission for me to report it. My grandpa and a friend of his were working in the fields at nightfall in the early &#39;80s, he forgot when. They saw a disk-shaped craft move silently through the air above them at a fast pace. He descirbed it as &#34;two saucers put together&#34; and stated it had lights around the edges. He was in a truck at the time and his friend was in a tractor, and both saw it. My grandpa is experianced in aeronautics, having been a pilot and a avid aerospace hobbiest. He had no prior belief in UFOs as far as I know and my grandma still does not believe in UFOs, even after his sighting. The next day when he went to work at the plumber&#39;s office, he talked to two other friends that told him they were fishing on the Missouri River when they saw a disk shaped object (that they described exactly like the one he saw) pass over them in the general direction of the farm where my grandpa was working. He is absolutely sure it was not a plane, but leaves open the possibility of it being a government aircraft undergoing testing (he lives roughly 25 miles from Offut Airforce base) or a spacecraft.<n>

10/15/82 20:00|Barton|VT|Rectangle|20 minutes|Observed very large lighted object moving and then  hovering  above a hay  field.|9/9/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/031/S31300.html|9|ndxe198210| Observed very large lighted object moving and then  hovering  above a hay  field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This encounter was one of two that I have had in my liftime, I am not a UFO watcher but have been convinced of something unusual happening around us. On the night of my sighting I was helping out with farm chores for a neighboring dairy farmer, this is a remote farming community where we frequently pitch in to help a neighbor. The farm owner and I had finished bringing the cattle into the barn to feed them prior to milking, as was customary we went to the house for a coffee and somthing to eat before we began milking. We went to a sitting room which has a bay window that looks out over a 30 acre hay field, beyond the field is a large tract of timberland encompassing several hundred acres, this timberland is uninhabited and has no roads. We had been sitting in the room just chatting when my friend asked if I could see the lights approaching over the tree tops, I had not but caught site of them immediatly. We mused that they must be a helicopter. The VT and NY National Guard would often run training missions in our area out of Burlington VT or Plattsburgh NY so that is what we assumed this was. We continued to watch the lights approach from over the timberland and as they came closer we could see that the light were very different from an approaching helicopter. The elivation was no more than 1500&#39; which initially led us to beleive we were seeing a chopper, with the lights just a few hundred feet away and moving slowly but steadily toward the hay field we went outside to get a better look. As we walked out the front door the first thing we noticed was that there was a loud hum and definite electrical poping coming from the electric line on the poles that ran along the roadway, I need to comment that this noise was alarmingly loud and was definitely coming from the utility lines, had I not been able to see the lines I would had guessed the insulators were arcing and bursting, but as we walked under the lines toward the hay field and the approaching lights we observed that the lines were mot! ionless and there was no arcing. We ended up standing side by side about 50 to 75&#39; into the field. The lights were at this time just above the tree tops and I would estimate 800&#39; feet to the South West. We could now hear what I would say was a droaning hum coming from the object, the noise would vary in pitch from low to high but in low tones. As the object approached the edge of the field it turned slightly to the right on a North Easterly course, we thought it would pass us on that course but as we stood there it entered the area of the field and then when it was 300 or 400&#39; feet away it turned again and came toward us. I did not mention that this was a clear night with stars visible, and that as this object got closer we were aware that it blocked out the sky in a large area, we guessed the the object was 200&#39; wide by 500&#39; or 600&#39; feet in length. This may sound odd but we had the impressionm that the object turned to observe us. It approached us to within 100&#39; and remained at what we agreed was about 1500 feet in elivation. What happened next was what convinsed us that this was a very unusual event, the object began to power down and became completly stationary, the engine noise was also completely gone. It did not move in any dirction whatsoever, however the lights remained on. We were both scared to the point of wanting to run but curiosity kept us in the field. The only noise was the crackling of the utility lines now behind us and out next to the road. The object was lighted. We were now looking nearly straight up at the object and as I recall we could see several lights on what to us was the front of the object, the lights were yellow, green, white, orange and blue. We could see the front and along the bottom of both sides of the object the light were arranged at intervals of several feet apart along what we observed as the edges of the object. We just stood and stared at this thing for 5 to 8 minutes, I remember us being really astonished by the fact that this thing was completly motionless and ! made absolutliy not audible noise. When it was ready to go it powered up and began to move on the same course that it had been on when we first observed it, no cars passed in the time that we were watching it. We had a clear view to the Northeast into Canada from where we stood and the object was headed slowly in that direction. My friend asked if we should call someone, I suggested that we call the Plattsburgh, NY Airforce Base and make a report. He went back to the house to make the call while I stayed outside to watch it move away. The utility lines continued to crackle and pop even when the object had moved to 8 or 10 miles away (the electricity and phone was not effected) I went back to the house after 10 minutes and found my friend on the phone, he said that he was speaking to a Lt Colonel from Plattburgh air base. He was on the phone for at least 30 minutes making a detailed report of the event, this colonel took the report seriously and was very patient asking many questions. I was asked to go out and look for the object 3 or 4 times as they were speaking. I did observe two jet aircraft fly over the farm but they were heading Easterly about 90 degrees to the object, the object was at least 30 miles to the north by this time but should have been visible to the pilots or picked up on radar. The base did disclose that the planes we observed were from the base and that they reported no unusual activity. When the phone call ended I asked my friend if he thought he had been taken seriously or just led on, he said that the colonel was sincerly interested in what was said and appeared to be writing word for word the conversation. It would be an understatement to say that this was a very unsettling experience. This fellow and I have never spoken to any one but our wives in regard to what we saw. I now live just 4 miles from the farm where this happened. I stopped to visit with this man last year, we had not spoken to each other of the event in 20 years! As we talked the conversation went back to that nigh! t, he admitted that this has had a lasting effect that to this day haunts him, he said that several times over the years he has heard the same noise at night we heard from the craft but does not go out to look. I was made curious by what happened and have used my curiosity as motivation to read all that I can on the subject. At the time of this occurance I was employed as a State Deputy Fish and Wildlife Officer, my friend was and is to this day a dairy farmer on this same farm. I know it likely seems odd to not report this for 21 years, but to be honest I felt that it was not going to be taken seriously and my friend will not to this day speak to anyone in regard to what happened. He does accept that I have chosen to make the report and may be willing at some point to weigh in with his account.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/15/82 20:00|North Hudson|NY|Disk|1-2 minutes|Full View of structure|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34012.html|10|ndxe198210| Full View of structure<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had worked in Lake Placid all day and were heading back to the Northway (I-87) on route 73 when the first phenomenon occured, a flashing light type thing as if there were lightning. The sky was crystal clear  which made it wierd, starry and a 2/3 waxing moon was up. It was about 8pm. We got on the Northway heading south at Exit 30 and a minute or 2 down the road I was the first to notice a well lighted Object hanging about 500 feet off ther ground and just east of the road. At first I thought it was a helicopter and mentioned this to my secretary, and we both said no. Then it suddenly dawned on the both of us that it was a UFO. It was so close that we see could see its complete outline and details of its structure. Its perimeter was outlined with red lights, One bright red at each 90 degrees with two smaller red lights in between. There was a huge flood light at its bottom center pointing to the ground. And the top turret system had multiple lights aimed in many directions. It was approximately 50 to 60 yards in diameter. It was dead silent. It slowly floated just barely of center as it hung, something like a gyroscope gently wabbles as it spins ever so slightly. The moon was at just the right angle to illuminate its upper surface. The finish was flat or buff, metallic grey, and there were no markings on the hull or fusilage. We had had trouble with our car earlier, so I didn&#39;t stop, but we did pull over to the shoulder and slow down to a crawl while we observed it. Then some trees came up between it and us in the center island and when we came out on the other side, it was gone. Did it land or take off we couldn&#39;t tell. When got home inn Glens Falls, I called the local police and Channel 13 in Albany, and they all blew me off like was a crackpot. Since then, I was talking with one of my friends who lived on Lake George for  many years and he told me that he had seen light like formations flying down along the lake several times when lived there, especially in the dead of winter, when the lake was frozen and no one was really around. My ownb personal theory is that there may be a landing port somewhere in the depths of the Adirondacks for one large reason- Ther are some heavy iron deposits in the Adirondacks that will even throw off a compass. What a great area under which to conceal a UFO landing port! That&#39;s it. That&#39;s my story. I wouldn&#39;t tell it any more because people look at me wierd when I do, but I have a witness, my secretary, who still works for me after all these years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was no moon or stars visible as it was a very thick cloud covering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was driving north I was approaching a development called Weinkeeg Valley Estate and I saw these lights that were in a single row, stacked vertically, flashing on and off like the ones on a broadcasting tower.  I remember thinking to myself that there was no tower here so what is that?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to drive by but for some reason my curiosity got the better of me and I stopped my vehicle and backed up.  There was no other traffic on the road at that time so I got out to have a better look.  As I stared at the lights I became aware of faint round windows arranged in between the lights.  If my memory serves me well I believe there were two lights above and two below with the windows, more like port holes, running horizontally.  To my amazement I noticed that the portholes were indicating a round surface as they went from round to elliptical at the edges.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still had no clue as to what I was looking at until it very quietly drifted away over the tree tops. This oblect was no more than 75 feet from the ground and directly over a small home.  I seem to recall a soft humming sound and nothing else.  It wasn&#39;t a helecopter, no noise, no rotors beating the air, nothing conventional that would explain what I was looking at.  It just floated away in total silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would estimate that the diameter of the craft was about 30-40 feet.  It was so dark in color that despite being less than 200 feet away I could not see its form.  It could have been a sphere for all I know.  I honestly could not see a shape to this thing at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of this happened in the early 80&#39;s and I never forgot it.  All my life I wanted to see a UFO and when I got the chance to I had no clue as to what I was looking at until it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen anything again up that close but I sure would like to relive that CE one more time and have the chance to really observe a chance of a lifetime.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

After work, my girlfriends and I would go to a cul de sac in the back of the country club to hang out and party.  They were building new homes back there, but none were completed. The road was completed and allowed for some privacy, as few cars ever drove by.  That night we,  (there were three of us in the front seat),  were just pulling up to the back of the &#34;cul de sac&#34;(before having any drinks), when a bright light came over the top of the car.  The three of us were unable to move, it was like we were frozen in time.  We were facing forward and we were unable to communicate or move.  I guess during this time the car shut off.  We all came out of this trance at the same time.  We all began to cry simultaneously and I tried quickly to get the car started to get out of there.  At about the same time we noticed truck lights behind us on the main road leading to the &#34;cul de sac&#34;. The truck passed and we left as quickly as possible.  What we remebered, we all recounted pretty much exactly the same things, was that the car was shaking, like it was lifted up and dropped.  This was at the very beginning I think, so maybe it was the fact that I could not move and because the car was a stick shift, shook as it was out of gear and shut off?  When we came back, the car was difficult to start and that may have been the fear, maybe I was unable to simply start it, but I do recall the cassette deck being screwed up and the clock on the dash.  We all estimated we had lost about ten to fifteen minutes as we knew when we arrived. We went to a local bowling alley and got a guy we knew to go back with us to see if anything was there.  Unfortunately, we were too frightened and opted to stay down the road about a mile, while he did it alone.  He laughed at us and, of course, this became a joke with our other friends.  I spoke with my father about it later that night and he said it must have been something,(because I had not bee! n home on a Saturday night @9:00 PM since I was in Junior High).  Anyway, I am 38 now, A Financial Planner, sane individual.  All three of us grew up to be responsible, educated, professinal adults.  However, I am unable to forget this event.  Please, I am open to any insight. I witnessed another similar event after this one, I posted that earlier this year.  One of the same girls was with me again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

10/8/82 22:50|Fort McMurray (Canada)|AB|Light|8 seconds|Beam of lights over trees in Canada|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51757.html|18|ndxe198210| Beam of lights over trees in Canada<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving up from Edmonton to Ft Mac, Alberta is a lonely &amp; boring 5 hr. drive - all trees along a stretch of narrow highway. I am reporting this now because it has bothered me even after all these years. It was an overcast under a partial moonlit night. I was driving and my girlfriend and I saw it first then the two back seat passengers acknowledged it. We were silent for about 10 seconds as we watch this object hover just above the trees about 300 meters away and about 75 meters above the ground. It had 2 light source that shown down to the ground. The &#34;beam of light&#34; moved about as if they were looking for something. About 8-10 seconds later the lights shut off and the object vanished into the clouds very quickly. We could not see the object at all. We were all so puzzled by it. It was definitely not a helicopter with its blue or red blinking lights and to appear in the middle of no where.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides no contact information.

10/8/82 18:00|Weaverville|NC|Other|unknown|Bell shaped UFO with lights hovering without sound.|7/19/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76612.html|19|ndxe198210| Bell shaped UFO with lights hovering without sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Buncombe County, N.C.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was 1982, I believe in October, and probably within a half hour before the sun went down.  It was on 19-23 at the Jupiter-Barnardsville exit.  The object was not obviously metal and did not reflect light and if I guessed how far off the ground it was I would think roughly 300 ft but no more, and the size was large and if it landed it would have likely took up the width of the median and both sides of the roadway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was bell shaped and the bottom of it had three lights (I believe 2 blue and 1 red) and shining down from the center was a single white beam of light that was uniform size from where it came out of the object all the way to the ground.  The object was hovering without sound directly above a section of ground between Old Mars Hill Hwy and the ramp that takes vehicles from Jupiter Rd up to 19-23S with the light shining directly down between Old Mars Hill Hwy and the ramp.  There was some dust or vapor that appeared to be moving inside the beam of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I might not have believed my eyes but there were cars pulled over on both sides of the highway and people were looking at it, the way I would have liked to, but my boyfriend who was driving was so scared he wouldn’t pull over and only slowed down enough to get a good look.  I do not know how long it hovered there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even now, the guy who is now my ex-husband says that yes he saw something, there were cars pulled over and yes it scared the hell out of him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

10/7/82 23:00|New Haven|CT|Triangle|10 minutes|I, and another individual, observed a triangular-shaped, multi-colored, silent object slowly traverse the night sky of New Haven, Conn.|5/11/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42244.html|20|ndxe198210| I, and another individual, observed a triangular-shaped, multi-colored, silent object slowly traverse the night sky of New Haven, Conn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was a graduate student attending Yale University. I was lounging on the roof of one of the University buildings (located in the heart of downtown New Haven) in the company of 2 other students. One student was about 30 feet away and was standing near the edge of the roof and was looking down at the street. I was lying on my back looking at the beautiful clear summer night sky. The other student, a friend named ((name deleted)), was crouched next to me and was talking to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I looked at the stars I suddenly noticed, coming into view, a triangular-shaped object moving rather slowly, and very smoothly, across my field of vision. It had rounded edges, made no noise I could hear, and had solid, regularly spaced bands of various colors which slowly passed across it&#39;s glowing, illuminated surface. I was stunned, and remember thinking &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes it faded from view, and I realized that I had just seen a UFO. At this point I had said nothing, and ((name deleted)) was still jabbering away to me about whatever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute or two later the same object, or a second, identical object, traversed the night sky above me, but in a different direction (I do not recall N/S/E/W details). This time I said to ((name deleted)) &#34;Hey! Look up there and tell me if you see that?&#34;   He looked up and exclaimed (and I remember thinking this was funny) &#34;What the hell is that?&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can&#39;t judge the size of the object because there was nothing available to apply scale, but I had the &#34;feeling&#34; it was something quite large and several hundred yards above.  I think I got this sensation because of how stately it moved across the sky; absolutely smooth, straight, and rather slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I am grateful the damned thing gave me a second chance to get ((name deleted)) attention. If no one else had seen it I might think it was just my imagination.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what it was, but it absolutely was not a planet or a star, nor a prop-aircraft, a jet, a copter, a kite, a satellite, nor do I think it was a blimp (although I suppose this is a remote possibility, but it would it have to have been one helluva weird blimp).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

10/1/82 22:10|Swartz Creek|MI|Fireball|3 to 4 minutes|blazing sphere across the southern sky from 1982|3/21/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/027/S27069.html|22|ndxe198210| blazing sphere across the southern sky from 1982<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 16 or 17 years old the time of this event. It was a clear October night around 22:10 and I was walking home from a friends house alone. Where I lived there were not street lights so it was pretty dark. The majority of the walk was towards the east. When I got to a point that I had to turn South, I noticed an abnormal amount of barking dogs. MUCH more than normal. I could tell the difference in the dogs barking at me and something else. There were dogs 3 streets over in all directions going crazy. More like, howling and whining than anything else. Some were barking at me I could tell but it sounded like dogs from 1/2 a mile away were going nuts. There were no cars driving around either. As I turned to the South, a large fireball caught my eye in the Southern Sky. It was moving West to East about 60 degrees off the horizon at a relatively slow pace. It looked like a small sun with a fat tail behind it that went to a point very quickly. As I was staring at it, 8 smaller spheres relative in size to the original ball split off from the larger ball and just sort of drifted behind it. The smaller spheres sort of exploded off the large sphere in all directions except in the front of it. I watched this whole thing as I walked slowly home. The spheres never changed speed but it was a constant quick pace across the southern sky. I was able to view this event until the speres disapeared over the eastern horizon. As soon as I couldn&#39;t see it anymore, the barking stopped. I could hear my two dogs as well since I was close to home. I told my friends about it and of course I was crazy, making things up. One of my sisters friends said her boyfriend at the time was driving south on another road about 5 miles away and pulled over along with 6 other cars to observe the same thing I was seeing. I was told it was a meteorite but to this day it was something that is unexplained or unidentified.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
