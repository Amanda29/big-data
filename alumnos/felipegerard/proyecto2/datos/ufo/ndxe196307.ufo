When she was 12 years old, she lived NE of Tupelo with her parents. On a sunday evening, she witnessed a disc-shaped craft hovering over high-power lines near their house. It was stationary above the lines for about an hour. It had a dome on the bottom, with soft lights running around the perimeter of the craft. She thought at the time these might have been windows, but in retrospect, could have been running lights.<n>

I saw a bright triangular light in the sky, very high up.  It was doing loops and turns a plane could not.  I called my mother out to watch with me.  Suddenly, two more of the same joined in and they &#39;played&#39; for almost a half hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two interesting reports submitted by the same witness.  The other report is for Boston, MA, for August 4, 1964.  PD))<n>
7/15/63 23:00|Portland|OR|Sphere|1/2 hour|1963 - Round hovering, soundless, rotating object over northeast Portland, Oregon|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61343.html|3|ndxe196307| 1963 - Round hovering, soundless, rotating object over northeast Portland, Oregon<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was at my cousin&#39;s house for the weekend.  She lived with her mom and sister in northeast Portland. My cousin&#39;s sister suddenly called out to us that she saw a flying saucer across the street, hovering over the park.  We, of course, didn&#39;t believe her - it was just too coincidental that we were watching Science Fiction Theatre at the same time!  Then, her mom, my aunt, said it was true, come and see it!  We flew up the stairs and went out the front door of the house.  By the time we got up stairs, the object seemed to be hovering over the &#34;Hollywood&#34; district in east Portland, about a mile south of where we were.  As it hovered, we could see a bank of greenish lights, followed by a bank of whiteish lights (about the same color as regular light bulbs).  From the rotation of the lights, we could see that the object was hovering, while turning clockwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 10 minutes, it moved to the east and then to the north, where we guessed it was near the Portland Airport.  We called the airport to find out if anyone in the tower could see it on their radar.  The answer we received was that it was a &#34;plane, flying a banner behind it&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This obviously did not make sense, since it was 11:00 pm.  In addition my cousin&#39;s sister called her mother-in-law to be when she guessed it was over her mother-in-law&#39;s house and the report was that the object was &#34;as big as a house&#34;, round, and didn&#39;t make any noise whatsoever.  The only sound was a &#34;whoosh&#34; as it sped by.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This has always stuck in my mind, since our technology did not extend, specifically, to soundless, round objects that could hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Gazing up into the night time at the stars and focused on one particular that was on a movement in a paralelle manner traveling from the south to the north when it dissapeared behind another star (light) larger that itself.  Waiting for it to come thru on the other side and it seemed like ages, but it came out going in the direction it had came from(south)???? It was traveling at a good rate of speed too.    I was somewhat flaborgasted by the results and told my wife about the incident at the time and did think it was unusual?? I kept this to myself all these years, but did occasionally tell of this to a few individuals.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.

The dance was held outdoors around the swimming pool area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10:00 p.m. the band stopped playing and everyone gathered around the pool looking at these strange lights hanging in the Northern sky. There were about 4 or 5 of the white cicular lights hovering in the sky but not moving. Everyone tried to reason what they could have been, but no one has an explanation for them. Alcohol was not allowed on the premise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Most of the kids (150 or so) were from Casady, John Marshall and Putnam City High Schools. This sighting was the talk of the schools for serval weeks. I have always believed to this day they were UFOs and still do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What prompts me to report it now is the news yesterday the ex governor&#39;s UFO sighting in Phoenix and the French releaseing their UFO information.  What the ex governor saw is exactly what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/15/63 21:00|Virginia Beach|VA|Circle|15 minutes|4 glowing circles 40 ft in diameter flying in rigid formation - aerial acrobatics 100 ft off the beach for > 15 minutes -many witnesses|6/3/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29001.html|6|ndxe196307| 4 glowing circles 40 ft in diameter flying in rigid formation - aerial acrobatics 100 ft off the beach for &gt; 15 minutes -many witnesses<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the beach, in the summer, with a close friend and his family after eating a buffet dinner at the Sea Horse Inn off 79th st and Atlantic Ave.. It had just become dark out, and we all watched 4 circular completely silent objects about 40 feet or more in diameter (along with all the others on the beach at the time -people were basically just quietly standing and gawking at these objects) and only about 100 feet offshore. They flew in rigid formation, straight up to an altitude of several hundred feet and then dipped to about 50 feet and would go straight up again. They kept this up almost as if they were doing yo yo tricks which no known aircraft I knew of could possibly do. Again they were completely silent. My friends mother suggested we leave the beach because she thought they could be UFOs and we could be in danger despite the wonder of it all. We did leave. My friend&#39;s mother said she saw the glowing objects the following night as well but I wasn&#39;t on the beach with her at that time. My eyes were excellent and though I was only about 11 at the time, I strained to get some detail because they were so close, but all I could make out was that the bottom of the craft emitted a white light, like the surface was emitting the light but it was a diffuse light and not directed like a beam. They light was not brilliant, but about as bright as a white screen on a modern day CRT. We discussed afterward what was unusual, which was that they were totally silent (we were only a 100 feet away from these aerial acrobats) and that they glowed, and that they were able to stay in such rigid formation while maneuvering vertically, like a yo yo, even when they would hover, start and stop abruptly, drop and rise again and hover, almost as if they were part of the same object. But we all agreed they appeared to be separate objects. We also felt it was unusual because this sighting was not far from the Naval base down the beach (which my friend and I once walked to from this location). There were no j! et intercepts and there was nothing in the paper the next day either. It must have been witnessed by at least more than 50 people. I know these were not moons or satelites etc. I owned a telescope at the time and would easily be able to identify such objects. They also did not have qualities I would associate with mirages. The edges of the objects were crisp and did not wobble. You could see the normal effects of size change with distance as well as they came close and moved away (perspective indicated these objects were probably within 100 feet of the beach). The experience itself is clear enough in my memory, but I would have to really do some digging to determine the date. It was either 1962 or 1963 and it was definitely either July or August. Those are the times I visited my friend in Va.. This report is factual and true in terms of what happened and what I saw. I am not speculating as to what the objects were, but did try to indicate what I knew they clearly were not as I thought this could help in terms of accuracy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was like a round circle, it was spinning in two different directions at the same time. Everyone ran to the windows to see it. Then the company Commander told everybody to get away from the windows, and closed the blinds so we could not see it any longer.  I have the names of every man that witnessed this with me in my Graduation Book from Bootcamp.  I would like to know if anyone else has filed this report? Thank you. ((initials deleted))<n>
7/15/63 18:00|Great Lakes|IL|Disk|8 min|Couldn't believe how large it was and made no noise...|5/13/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28764.html|8|ndxe196307| Couldn&#39;t believe how large it was and made no noise...<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father was stationed in the Great Lakes Naval Training area in 1963 and we were living in the Navy housing at the time. Our house had a chain link fence in the back yard and a road that ran along the fence with woods on the other side of the road. At the time of my sighting I was playing kick ball in the back yard with my brother and sisters. It was in the evening time probably around 6:00 and there was still plenty of light out, since it stays light later in the summer. I was 12 years old at the time and my younger sister, by 3 years, was the first to point to the sky and say, &#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we all looked up to the sky, where she was pointing, I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing. It was a disk shaped flying saucer of a tremendous size. It seemed much larger than any airplane, but didn&#39;t make any noise at all. If I was to put my arms straight out in front of me, pointing my fingers straight out also, that is how much of the horizon this saucer was taking up in the sky. It was very slowly coming down for a landing. We stared in total awe at what we were seeing. My mother at this time was talking to the lady next door standing between the two houses. I ran to get her to come and witness this with us but she wouldn&#39;t come so I went back to watch it coming down with my brother and sisters. It was saucer shaped and it had an underside that seemed to have three colored spinning layers. The colors were like orange, blue and green or something like that. Each layer was spinning in the opposite direction from the layer next to it. It looked like each layer was spinning at the same speed though. Above the spinning layers was the main body of the craft that wasn&#39;t spinning. This area was much bigger than the three smaller spinning layers below. The size of this thing was amazing and it was coming straight down keeping perfectly level as it slowly came toward the earth. I listened very hard for any sound and couldn&#39;t hear anything. What amazed me was how large it was and that it didn&#39;t seem to be concerned about people seeing it. Yes, it was still light out and it was coming down for a landing very close to the Great Lakes Naval Training Facility. I was sure that other people must have witnessed what we were witnessing. It came down close enough from where I was that I could have gone over the fence and crossed the street to go through the woods and see where it landed. I was afraid to though. For some reason I had this feeling like I might not be coming back if I was to go over to look more closely at it. Looking back now I wish I had though. I also wish I had grabbed my mothers arm and insisted t! hat she come with me to see what we were seeing. All of these years she has acted like it was my young imagination. I&#39;ll never forget what I saw though. I have a theory about the spinning colored lower sections of the saucer. It looked like three gyros spinning in opposite directions on a single axis. It would be neat to be able to do an experiment with three gyros set up like that and see if it effects gravity in any way. Just a thought. I must say that this was the neatest thing that I ever witnessed in my life and I feel very lucky to have been able to see it. If anyone has any questions about what I saw, I will do my best to try to answer them for you. I would also love to hear from anyone else who was living in the Great Lakes area at that time and witnessed the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested that the witness have the other witnesses to the event submit reports, as well.  We have also suggested that he check the local newspapers for the date, to see if articles were written.  The witness is an engineer, and works in the space-exploration industry.  PD))<n>

It came from the horizon at an unimaginable speed. the sky was clear except for a cloud right above our heads. The height of the cloud was unknown and covered an area the size of a pizza pie held at arms legnth. this thing came at such a speed as to be beyond anything we have ever seen. It entered the cloud and was the size of a dime held at arms length. It did not exit the cloud as expected rather it sped off in the same direction that it came.the reverse direction only took 2 seconds and took off in the same direction that it came in at such a speed that by the time we started yelling the other players missed seeing it as it disapeared in the distant horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that night we were all playing hide and go seek.

7/2/63 19:30|Tucson|AZ|Other|15 -20 min|Large blimp like object 1960's|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32598.html|16|ndxe196307| Large blimp like object 1960&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently in my middle 50&#39;s and not a believer that we are being visited by beings from elsewhere.  As an amateur astronomer, I did volunteer work for the US Naval Observatory back in the late 60&#39;s.  This was in the early days of satellite before many precise measurements could be made from orbit.  My groups function, as ground based telescope observers, was to precisely time star occultation&#39;s, for the most part as they disappeared and reappeared behind the moon.  Just some background on my &#39;observing&#39; experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sighting was not during these exercises but during an outing to a drive-in theater.  It was still light out and I was biding time waiting for it to be dark enough for the movies to begin.  Above and to the left of the screen I noticed an object (I would place it as North, North - West, to the left of the Mt. Lemmon/Catalina range as you face it from north/west Tucson and about 30 deg. above the horizon) I can best describe as blimp shaped but somewhat narrower, pointed ends, silver in color but I don&#39;t recall it as being reflective, NO protrusions such as the cabin or fins that a blimp would have.  I first thought that it was some kind of experimental weather balloon but I noticed two other factors that didn&#39;t fit that profile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first was a cloud looking trail, long and snake like but detached from the object as if the object had stopped or stalled where it now was.  The observance of the trail (white/gray colored) lead me to the second observation of the object, neither the trail or the object were moving much if at all.  Now I&#39;m starting to realize how distant in height and large this object is.  My estimate is maybe three football fields in length although it is very difficult to estimate since there weren&#39;t any nearby objects to compare it to.  The object and the trail seemed to stay pretty much in the same position for the next 15 minutes of so. There was a noticeable but slow drift and change in the trail during this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During that time, I took advantage of other witnesses in the car next to me.  I remember there being at least three people in that vehicle, a convertible.  I asked them what they thought the object was.  I still remember the reply clearly, a fellow sitting in the front seat starred again at the object and said &#34;I&#39;ll tell you what, I&#39;m in the Air Force and it&#39;s nothing that I have ever seen&#34; (Tucson as you know is the home of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base).  This was great confirmation that my imagination wasn&#39;t playing tricks on me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hated to loose sight of the object but before it was totally dark, I wanted to make my way the snack bar and use the pay phone to call the newspaper and ask if there were any reports coming in.  They didn&#39;t even seem to comprehend my question so I didn&#39;t get very far in that direction.  It really made me wonder if they were playing dumb!  Here this object was in plain sight, dozens of people just at the drive-in could observe it, surely you would think the newspaper would have some reports.  Maybe I just called too soon or just got the wrong individual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I went back to read your archives to see if there were any related sightings, another report brought back something I had observed some years earlier although not really a UFO sighting.  as a preteen/teenager in Tucson , I use to make an almost daily trek from my home to the nearby drugstore.  The route took me through a small area of undeveloped property (desert vegetation), a route I knew with my eyes closed.  On one trip to the store (1959-61?) I couldn&#39;t help noticing a round area where all the cactus and shrubs had been smashed to the ground, a perfectly round area.  Not a very large area maybe 10ft.  I also noticed some tracks, each track mark had three indentations as if a foot with three pads or toes.  I&#39;m fuzzy on the space between the tracks, could have been two feet or more apart but I&#39;m not sure I remember the actual spacing.  Could be rabbit tracks or... well I&#39;m not much for recognizing animal tracks, I&#39;ll leave that to someone else.<n> <n><n> <n><n> End report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Dates of two incidents are approximate.

Something scared all of the animals so bad that many of them either died of fright. It happend on the day I was born; It was told to me by a fellow student back when I was in highschool. my parents and siblings were in Kansas City at the time of the great light-up. It happened over the country home in which I was going to  be comming home to. When I grew up none of the other kids would have anything to do with me. So I don&#39;t know what to think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know for sure about what is true and isn&#39;t but This is what I was told when I graduated from Highschool in 1982  I lived out on a farm three miles out of town on route H.highway. Anyway livestock and wild life died for miles around. My father had to work and was asleep during the whole time and didn&#39;t even get up until the next morning when everything was over with. When the workers told him about it; He thought they were all crazy and told them to shut up. Still; my birth was considered an ill oman and the people there didn&#39;t want to have any close friendship with me. Wheather this happend or not; I don&#39;t know. That is all I can say Do not contact me at all unless its an E-mail only.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the source of this report to attempt to confirm it<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will request that the witness have other witnesses submit report, and attempt to obtain any news article about the event.  PD))<n>

Benton County Missouri July 1,1963|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38155.html|18|ndxe196307| Lights in the Sky? What are they and where did they c ome from? Benton County Missouri July 1,1963<n> <n><n> <n><n> THE DATE IS JULY 1, 1963 FROM 9 O CLOCK TO TWELVE MIDNIGHT A VERY STRANGE EVENT TOOK PLACE.The lights over a farm that was one mile south and three miles east out on lake raod H highway just outside of Lincoln Missouri.  It was told that many people were very upset at seeing lights over the farm that is out in front of a gravel road just off the blacktop H. Cattle horses hogs and other livestock animals died or literally run themselves to death along with several species of wild-life. From the southern end of Sedalia missouri it was thought that a massive fire was taking place. Some people sent fire trucks down to Benton county because it was thought there was a fire.<n> <n><n> <n><n> according to people there were hundreds of billions of lights in the sky some of them were lights within lights all colors imaginable. But the animals ran in sheer fright and the ones who didn&#39;t run; all died. The vets who come into the area said that many of the animals died as if run to death. Many farmers in the area lost thousands of dollars in livestock and crops. Other people fell dead thinking that it was the end of the world.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was the meeting of the townspeople and all of them wonderd what had happend that day. Someone told that a child had been born exactly seven hours earlier in Menora hospital of Kansas City Missouri.  The child&#39;s home was where all of the lights were seen above.  Many of the farmers in the region lost their livelihoods and were deeply bitter.  It was the night of devestation. Very few if any are alive today to talk about it. Most people do not want to talk of it. Most people deny anything happend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But they didn&#39;t want it to happen again. Funny about all of this is that the man of the house on this farm said that he went to bed at eight o clock. Most of the animals he had down at the barn consisted of Beagles and if there had been anything strange going on the head dog would have made a racket about it. The next morning; all of the dogs were fine the females with their puppies were all fine. The man didn&#39;t say anything but listined to everyone at work talking about what happend in the night He thought everyone was crazy.  Although he did look around the yard and found cow patties on the ground and several hoof marks and paths going up and down the pasture but still, none of the dogs knew anything about it.  So that is one of the stories right there.  If there is anyone who is out there who knows more about what happend may they enter their findings here. Any information on this wierd incident would be welcome. ITs here to either be proved or disproved. all entries are welcome.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We would welcome more information, or newspaper articles, about the alleged incident.  Does anyone else know anything about this event?  PD))<n>

Craft went straight up and out of sight. Jet left and as dark approached 13 crafts played in sky for many hours entering and disappearing into a cigar shaped craft. Hundreds watched and photographed. I was next to the campus cop and heard all the reports coming in on his radio from in and around the area. The local paper reported this event and nothing else that I know of ever happened. It has left many questions over the years. Question ! Has this ever been reported?<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saucer craft with rotating lights.<n>

THE LIGHTS WERE ROTATING AROUND THE OVAL SHAPED CRAFT.  THE CRAFT WAS GOING ACROSS THE SKY IN A STRAIGHT LINE AWAY FROM THE CITY.  THE SKY WAS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND THERE WERE OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE SKY AT THE TIME AND THIS DID NOT LOOK LIKE ANY OF THE OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE SKY.  A FEW YEARS LATER, I WAS LOOKING AT A &#34;LIFE&#34; MAGAZINE, I THINK THE YEAR WAS 1966 AND THEY HAD A BIG WRITE UP ON UFO&#39;S.  THE PICTURE OF WHAT I SAW WAS ON THE FRONT COVER.  I TOTALLY FREAKED OUT AND HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE HEAVENS EVER SINCE.  THE LIGHTS AROUND THIS CRAFT WERE RED,YELLOW,BLUE AND GREEN BUT THE COLOR SEEMED TO EXPAND AROUND AS IT ROTATED AROUND THE CRAFT.  IT WAS VERY STANGE BECAUSE I HAD NEVER SEEN AN AIRCRAFT WITH LIGHT LIKE THAT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>
