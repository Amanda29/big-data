Low muffled fire sound.|12/23/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26392.html|1|ndxe197510| Very low flying object with spinning multicolors. Craft did not seem to spin and had fire coming from rear. Low muffled fire sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a whim, I just visited the website &#34;ufos in Connecticut&#34; because I saw a news bit on tv about a recent British report declassification. I was amazed to see a listing of a sighting from 1969 that was just like what I experienced as a boy. It has been a long time but I remember it like this.  I was playing in the yard at night with three other children who lived in the house next door. This was in Kent in the 1970&#39;s and it was very rural and quiet there.  It was a very still and clear night. We were playing hide and seek and happened to be in a group in the center of the yard. I was about 12. The other boy, ((name deleted)), was my age and his twin sisters were about 10. The yard is surrounded by dense trees so it is impossible to see more than 50 yards in any one direction. Basically, the only way to look any distance is staight up. We were standing there and a flying object came over so low I remember it was maybe a couple hundred yards higher than the tallest elm trees.  It was multicolored and disc shaped. The multicolors seemed to spin as if the disc was spinning. But I remember that just the colors were spinning. The craft itself was not spinning and this was evident because flames were shooting out the back.  Just like the short report I just read, it was very silent except for a deep muffled sound which sounding like flames burning. It flew right over the house and disappeared. We ran inside to tell our parents, who were enjoying cocktails together. I remember my mother simply dismissing it as an airplane and we could not convince them of what we saw. I was very surprised to see the description from Bristol, Ct. It was very similar to my experience.<n>

Some form of vapor trails were behind the object, three maybe four.The object itself was just hovering above me motionless.It gave of a dark red color, solid no blinking, the light thats was white around it i could not tell where or what was causing it. i watch the object for two or three minutes just sitting in the sky about a hundred feet or so above me. then something in me made me turn my bike around and go break neck  to my grand mothers house as fast as i could. I COULD NOT EVEN TELL MY PARENTS WHAT HAD HAPPEN FOR STUTTERING AND NEARLY COLLAPSING FROM FEAR. MY MOTHER CAN VERIFY THAT.SHE HAS NEVER FORGOTTEN THIS EITHER. THIS IS NOT A STORY OF A SCARED BOY OF 9. I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT AND TRIED TO BRING A RESONABLE EXPLAINATION OF THIS NIGHT AS I GREW OLDER. I AM NOW 33 YEARS OLD AND STILL I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SAW. I DID NOT BELIEVE IN UFOS TILL THAT NIGHT.I COULD NOT EVEN MUSTER THE COURAGE TO RETURN THE BYCICLE TO THE NEIGHBORS WHERE I HAD BORROWED IT . NO, I DID NOT SEE LITTE GREEN OR GREY MEN OR HUMANOIDS, BUT I DID SEE SOMETHING.I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE HAD SEEN OR REPORTED ANYTHING LIKE THIS THEN OR SOME OTHER TIME.TRUST ME. I HAVE THOUGHT AND TRIED TO FIND THE ANSWER. BUT I CAN ONLY SAY I SAW SOMETHING AND IT SCARED ME, A LITTLE BOY OF 9.<n>

It came down very fast and stopped, hovering in front of my car over the road. It took up the whole road, and my car stopped so that I couldn&#39;t move ahead. When it got down to the road in front of me, it then look like a saucer shape with very bright lights all around. I think I was momentarily in shock. I screamed, but noone heard or saw me. The houses around were dark like noone was home. I yelled can anyone see this or hear me, but noone was there. It hovered in front of me, but I don&#39;t no how long since I seemed to be in some state of shock. And then it took off into the sky very, very, fast in a zig zag fashion and disappeared into the horizon. I didn&#39;t tell anyone but my family about it. I was afraid that people would think I was crazy, so I tried to forget about it and thats why I am not positive on the date except that I think it was around Halloween sometime in October in the 70&#39;s, and there were other sitings around the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/27/75|Limestone|ME|Light|20:00?|Loring AFB 1975 Sighting|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63278.html|4|ndxe197510| Loring AFB 1975 Sighting<n> <n><n> <n><n> Loring A.F.B.<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.nicap.org/ncp/ncp-loringafb.htm   I was the Air Force Officer (rank of Captain and B-52 Aircraft Commander) in charge in the Command Post at the 42nd Bomb Wing at Loring A.F.B the first night of this sighting.  Many of the details of the night have been forgotten, but I haven’t forgotten that it happened.  I do remember being on duty and receiving a call from Security and was told that there was a bright white light hovering over the primary entrance to the base.   Many of the typical calls that we received could be handled with the use of a binder full of checklist.  That way the Wing Staff wouldn’t have to be disturbed in the evening and could be briefed in the morning.  It didn’t take too long to realize that we didn’t have a checklist that applied to the information being given to us during this call.  We were told that the bright white light was stationary and there was no engine noise.  I promptly notified the Wing Commander and he appeared at the Command Post in a very short amount of time.  These sightings went on for many of the following nights that I worked.  Many of the following nights the Command Post would have the usual two Controllers plus several of the Wing Staff members.  One night as I was getting off my work shift we received a call that another sighting had been made.  We were not able to see these sighting ourselves because there were no windows in the Command Post.  The Wing Commander asked me to take his Staff Car and take the Helicopter Pilot to his aircraft.  That was the first sighting that I actually made of this bright white light.   It appeared to be hovering over the runway from where I was standing but this also could have put it over the weapons storage area.  I dropped off the Helicopter Pilot and watched him takeoff towards the object that we had been watching.   I saw it leave very rapidly as he approached it.  It left so rapidly that it almost would appear that it had simply turned its light off.  That is not what happened because I could detect a very rapid motion from a standstill.  This accelerat! ion was faster than any that I had ever seen before or since.  I know there was much effort during the days that followed to try and gather information about possible landing sites in the area.  Airports were checked for transient aircraft landings and fuel purchases.   Fields and wide riverbeds were also considered.  No information was ever collected that I am aware of that would verify that this was just some kind of aircraft/balloon/helicopter/hoax as we know it.  Needless to say, I only had and needed access to information that pertained to the performance of my job as a Command Post Controller.  I can say that as far as I know, this sighting remained Unidentified, it was Flying and it was an Object.  So, I can refer to this as a UFO but I can’t make any conclusion of its origin/destination/intentions.   I believe that Approach Control was able to track the object with radar as I recall.   I can’t confirm much of the other information that I have read but I do know what took place where I was working.   It was a very impressive sighting and would be quite hard to believe unless you were there and saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

As I was watching the clear sky the objects appeared to blink on as if entering the atmosphere and heated up. There was a larger craft leading 5 or 6 wings of 3 of about one third the size. First they were viewed from above then made a turn upward and toward the north at which the bottom of the formation could be seen. As they continued they took a sharp angle upward and the top of the formation was again observed. The exit angle was at about &#34;11 o-clock in the northwestern sky. The formation was approx. 6 times longer than it was wide.<n> <n><n> <n><n> OOPS-----SEE above None of the characteristics below were observed.<n>

10/20/75 22:00|Enterprise|AL|Other|two minutes|Very low, very slow flying, silent, black trapezoid viewed by 4 family members for about two minutes|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42571.html|8|ndxe197510| Very low, very slow flying, silent, black trapezoid viewed by 4 family members for about two minutes<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the particular UFO sighting night, I had been out of doors for quite a while  and was getting chilled and tired of the lawn chair. The duration of my stargazing session was probably from around 8 PM to nearly 10PM that nite. Just to be safe, I&#39;d say that the hours from 730PM to 11PM found me outside looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well about the time I get up to go inside, my mom or dad, comes out back to get me. Here&#39;s the odd part. I&#39;m right outside a little ways into the back yard (which is chainlink fenced for our dog) to be apart from the ambient light from the house. We had sliding glass doors to the back yard and a small concrete patio.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I&#39;m out in the yard and instead of going right into the den through the sliding doors I get up  and walk north to  the yard fence gate and go through it around to the carport and enter the house through the utility/laundry room into the kitchen. I took off my coat and may have had a blanket to put away and then go into the kitchen which opens into the den.  Huh....no family in the den??? Wonder where they went, I&#39;m thinking? About that time they all ( both parents, older brother, and younger sister) come back into the house through the sliding glass doors into the den. The ensuing conversation goes something like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Where&#39;d you guys go?-I ask.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Out back looking fo you! -they replied.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of you?-I ask.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Yea,...did you see it? See what? The UFO! No,........you guys are kidding me, right? NO! didn&#39;t you SEE it? No, I didn&#39;t. Where was it? What did it look like? It was right over the house, It was HUGE, black and made no noise! They all were looking at me quite seriously and no acting or practical joking was going on because my disbelief and smiling about their responses should have cracked at least my little sister&#39;s composure. She was about10 -11 years old at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> You guys are joking, right? No! they insisted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> How big was it? What color was it? What did it do, where did it go? What did it look like? WHY didn&#39;t you get me? They thought I was also looking at it the same time but didn&#39;t see me because I was walking around the house and went under the carport. Plus they were all looking up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad, a 20 year Army pilot then got a sheet of notebook paper folded it in half and drew what they witnessed. It was silent, dark grey or flat black in color without insignia of any kind visible. No panels, windows, landing gear, protrusions or cockpit were visible. Four small red lights located on the underside that were constant in nature were seen. The altitude was twice a telephone pole above the ground as it flew over telephone poles and the tree tops in our neighborhood at the time were lower than this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Size of the craft was in the 60-80 foot width and 45-55 foot length. Flat was the general profile description my family gave. The drawing my dad did within a couple of minutes of the sighting was that of a trapezoid, not a true triangle, but an equilateral triangle with the apex missing  at near the half-way point.  No rounded edges or bulges. The small red lights were located near the corner points of the craft. Altitude and speed remained constant during viewing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They viewed it for about 90 seconds to two minutes as it went from North to South across the backyards of Victoria drive (map availabel upon request) crossing Rucker Blvd and continuing  on out of view. Estimated speed was between 5 and 25 MPH maybe closer to 10 MPH. My dad held up his hand palm down and demonstrated a slow, smooth flight. He also indicated that he could have hit it with a baseball, hand thrown.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Kind of amazing to me after all these evenings that I&#39;m out back with good quality &#34;big eyes&#34; as I call them (binox) and my normal path into the house would have put me right into the den with the family, but noooo, I go slowly around the house under the carport while the first of my family members to see the craft calls the rest outside to witness the event and I miss the whole thing. I have never before reported this event.<n>

10/20/75 01:30|McDermott|NV|Sphere|3 hours|A large, glowing ball that changed colors, and drifted overhead and to the South and West of me.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91181.html|10|ndxe197510| A large, glowing ball that changed colors, and drifted overhead and to the South and West of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #5.   McDermitt, Nevada Glow.  In 1975 my folks and I were in the Lapidary trade (commercial rock-hounds) digging about 10 miles west of McDermitt, Nevada, on the Disaster Peak Road, which is heading due west from McDermitt, Nevada, on the way to the Trout Creek Mountains.  We had a pick-up camper set up off the pickup as living quarters.  I would go home to Sweet Home, Oregon every other week to see my boys. (My divorce had decreed I could get my two sons every other weekend.) On the week--ends between, I&#39;d go shopping on Sunday in Winnemucca, Nevada, for what supplies and food we would use while mining at that location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For some reason my parents needed to go out for one of the week-ends and I stayed alone at the digging pit.  Our location was high on a desert plateau, almost always a wind, very dry, but the elevation seemed to negate the heat, so it wasn&#39;t an unpleasant spot.  In the evenings it was difficult to get a good radio signal and television was out of the question. I would usually listen to KBOI, an AM frequency from Boise, Idaho.  Many nights I&#39;d fall asleep with the radio still playing and wake up to a bunch of stati cas it was not great reception on a constant basis.  Then I&#39;d turn off the radio and go back to sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This particular evening I woke up to static.....no big deal, figured I&#39;d forgot to turn the radio off as I would do quite often.  Surprise......when I went to turn the radio off, IT WAS OFF!   Okay, I figured I was still groggy from waking up.  I got out of bed, splashed my eyes with water just to be sure I wasn&#39;t having a dream.  At that time I noticed it was very light outside.  The amount of light outside seemed extra-ordinarily bright even if it was a full moon (which it was).  I opened the camper door, which faced to the west and noticed the full moon, okay, but also another glow coming from the small amount of clouds to the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, this glow was larger than the moon, which I could see easily, and was a shimmering yellow, white, silver, pink and kept changing colors as I watched it.  My jaw must have been gaping in disbelief!  As I watched, it would slowly move west, then south, then north......not quickly, but always in motion. It would drif! t out of the clouds, then into the clouds.  It was brighter than the full moon and constantly changing colors. (Pastel colors, not vivid colors.)  To say I was scared would be a bit of an understatement.  I went back inside the camper and got dressed. In the excitement it didn&#39;t take long to dress!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I continued to watch this object for over an hour. The noise that I had initially thought to be the radio was coming from this object. Not loud, but always present.  My best estimate of size would depend on the distance I thought it to be away from me. I estimate the object at 300-400 feet in diameter, and 5-8 miles away, maybe more.  I finally thought to look at the time.....4:10 A.M. So I must have awakened about 3:00 A.M.  It slowly drifted west over the Trout Creek Mountains out of view. Needless to say, I did NOT go back to sleep!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned on KBOI radio at about 6:00 A.M. Later that morning to the news of a sighting by several others within a couple hundred mile radius.  A Nevada State Trooper witnessed what I saw while he was patrolling between McDermitt and Winnemucca, Nevada, (actually he was near Orovada, Nevada at the time).  An Idaho State Trooper near Murphy, Idaho also reported seeing a large glowing object.  A mother and daughter driving toward Boise, Idaho from McDermitt also saw and reported the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the most interesting sightings, in my opinion, came from a man living near Boise. The man owned a private airplane, drove to the airport, started his plane and tried to get nearer the object, however, the object disappeared before he could get very far from the airport where he had departed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When my parents returned on Monday, the news had gotten to them before I had the opportunity to share my experience about it. We did spend a lot of time discussing it.  They were so disappointed they had gone back home and had missed the event.  I was so pleased to know others had witnessed this object.  The variety of witnesses was incredible.  It made news chatter for about a week and then faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again.......I know what I saw, and as I&#39;ve stated before.....I DON&#39;T DRINK nor do I ENGAGE IN DRUGS !!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The news story was about ufo and trips to eternity in a ufo where families even gave away there own kids to go on a trip to eternity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A lot of bs agreed.  Anyway heres what happened. Thinking about that news story later that night  I was wondering if they can read minds  So I kept thinking where I am with land marks and directions in my head thinking About new york by looking at a world map.  Right down to where my town is And what my house looks like and what’s near it. So later I sead and watched kojack on tv.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I lay on my bed watching tv what I first think was the moon came in view and maybe It was there all the time and I didn’t know it. Then it moved. Exact direction north east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The edges of it seem to have points and when it moved it looked like it was crawling on the sky. It was round. With small points all around its edge that get longer then Shorter like its pulling itself across the sky. What ever it was I think it was a living thing Of some kind. I was afraid to go near a window night for some time. Or go out at Night. I reported this to other ufo sites just check my story about the trips to eternity and Walter Cronkite. I don’t know how to spell his name so this is a sound like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I was so afraid  because I could feel it knows me. And can see me. I hope I never see it again. But it leaves me with the memory and I still would like it Explained to me what I saw NOTE i no longer live in greenwich ct and cant give my current address<n>

The large white light was in the center,on the bottom,protruding out slightly,which has always made me think I saw it taking off from the wooded area that was in the direction it came from.It made no sound and seemed to be gliding slowly.I watched till it went out of sight.I was a young mother,sober and not on drugs but no one believed me, not even my husband.

My husband was driving a new Ford &#39;76 4-door pickup that we just purchased. I was driving our old pickup and trailing behind because I was watching this light that at first I thought was a very large star. It came towards the earth (because it got brighter). I drove slower because it didn&#39;t move like an airplane and I wanted to watch it. It would go a little ways. Stop. Direction didn&#39;t matter - did what it wanted. I could see my husband had driven up to the house, so I stopped to watch it. It was round and far enough away that I could not see any other distinguishing shapes or color - only a brighter-than-bright white light. Neither of us was doing anything and that was boring. Finally, I got out of the vehicle and looked up, held up my arms and said &#34;come get me&#34;! . . . .the darn thing took off. . . like up until it couldn&#39;t be seen anymore.(I showered and used deodorant soap that morning. Guess they thought I would be a waste of their time). ((name deleted)) (This is the first report I&#39;ve ever made).<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

In the 70s, he worked as a police officer in the capital city of Montpelier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just after dark in the fall of the mid-70s, my grandfather was on Interstate 89 on his way from Montpelier to Burlington. As a cop, he knew just about every major project in that relatively small and unpopulated state, so he was surprised to see some sort of construction project on the side of a small mountain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He could make out a huge dark shape (which at the time he presumed was a small mountain) covered in bright lights, slightly obscured by the unusually hazy air (considering the time of year.)  Since it was October and the Vermont ski season was fast approaching, my grandfather believed it was construction of a new ski resort. He pulled over next to around a half dozen other motorists who were trying to see what was going on but he couldn’t figure out exactly what it was.  It did not make any noises louder than those coming from the highway behind him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day, on his way back to Montpelier, he pulled over at the same milepost so that he could get a glimpse of it, but to his surprise, there was nothing there.  He looked around, and was able to locate where he stopped the night before, but this time, the “mountain” had vanished, and there was no sign of it anywhere.  To this day, he claims that what he saw that night was a massive UFO that had landed among the Vermont countryside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have noticed that it is an option to be contacted by an investigator.  While I did not check the box, I would be willing to chat with one if they have any questions or think my report is of any significance.  If so, my email is in the contact info (which I would like to be kept private.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

As I reached for my keys in the switch and turned my lights on, the dome-shaped object came up from out of our woods.  It started ascending and as it ascended, lights started going around the sides of the craft.  The higher it climbed it seemed the faster the lights would go.  I can remember red, white and green lights. I was so shocked, that I just sat there in the road. It hovered for a few minutes over a hickory tree which was alongside of our drive.

I recall her speeding up to try and outrun the objects, but they stayed with us. Interestingly, the next thing I remember is being on my front step, and it was now very dark, and much later.

I was 16 years old at the time and was walking along the edge of a soybean field with my trusty .22 rifle squirrel hunting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I heard a very loud high pitched buzzing sound (like a cicada in the trees--which it may have been) but then everything was silent--even the birds. I looked up over my shoulder and saw a silver sphere just hovering about 300 feet above the ground and 1/4 mile away. It just stayed there. I thought, &#34;hey look, a weather balloon.&#34; but there wasn&#39;t anything hanging from the bottom. Not a weather balloon. No gondola, so it also wasn&#39;t a hot air balloon either. It was just there hovering silently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Here&#39;s where I acted like a typical teenager. The .22 had a scope on it, so I looked at the sphere through the scope--looked like a shiny silver ball. I decided, &#34;what the heck&#34; I squeezed off a shot thinking if it was a balloon, I would be able to retrieve it. It hovered for a few seconds more then slowly drifted up and out of sight. There were cumulus clouds in the sky that day and the sphere was going along the edge of them rising in a slightly erratic fashion. But I was able to keep it in sight while it rose due to the contrast of the white clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing that still makes me wonder to this day is how readily I accepted what I saw and how I felt no alarm<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I live in a rural area, but the neighborhood I live in is fairly built up.  Because of my age, most people think that it was simply an overactive imagination, or a vivid dream that simply seemed real, but it wasn&#39;t a dream.  It was in the afternoon, about 2 hours before sunset, so there was plenty of light.  To my left were two tall pine trees, probably 80 - 120 feet high, and too my right was my house.  I was simply standing in my backyard, which is probably a tenth of an acre in size, and fairly clear, with only a few trees and grass.  I happened to look up, and coming from the west, moving east, approximately 300 ft up I saw a round, saucer shaped craft, colored like a copper penny.  It wasn&#39;t moving fast at all, maybe half the speed of a single engine plane, and making absolutely no noise at all, at least not that I could hear.  Being so young, I didn&#39;t have a very good perception of sizes, or distances, so everything is very approximate, but should be close, because I remember the event vividly.  It was probably around 30 - 50 feet in diameter, as far as I could tell and had what looked to be windows on the bottom.  Now, the windows could&#39;ve been something else, but that is what they looked like to me. There were 3 on each side of the bottom of the craft, and the reason I say they were windows is because they looked opaque...their coloration was drastically different than the actual copper color of the disk itself.  There are realistically a number of things they could&#39;ve been other than windows, but that is the best description I can give.  It simply moved from the west to the east, never moving very fast, in a straight line until it disappeared over the eastern horizon.  I&#39;ve told people about this encounter, and because I was so young, everyone feels like it was simply the overactive imagination of a child.  It wasn&#39;t, and I&#39;d take a lie detector test any day to prove it.  It was never scary, eerie, or creep! y.  It never did anything spectacular...it just flew from one side of the sky to another, in a straight line, never moving at a high speed, or defying the laws of physics by darting around.  It could&#39;ve been earthly, but I had not, nor have I ever seen anything resembling it.  I do live near both Tyndall and Eglin airforce bases, so it could&#39;ve been something from there, but again, it didn&#39;t look like anything I&#39;ve ever seen.  I know it was real.  I&#39;d be very interested in knowing whether or not anyone else in this area saw anything like I&#39;m describing in this area about the time I mention.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The sun was aready all the way up in the sky without a cloud in sight.  A large white glowing orb was visible high over Ft. Hood and as we watched, the object split into four with the original remaining in the center but at a much smaller size, then as we continued to watch the four lights that had broken off split again into four complete lights and at this time all the separate lights took off in different directions at a high rate of speed.  The original light stayed just long enough for the others to disappear and then took off itself at a high rate of speed straight up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

While living in the Prescott  Area,(Spring of 1995) my mom and I used to see  Cigar shaped, Disks,- (small and Large) in the skys even in broad daylight, my dad used to tell us we were seeing things, until............. He started seeing them too, he said one morning just before the break of day  a saucer shaped craft, was just over the mountain, maybe a Mile? and it had turned up so as to look at it  from the top , and he said it sat their for a few min, then  just went  up and out of sight, then the sun came all the way up, but he said he had enough light to see, it was not a plane ,or helicopter balloon, like  the Government  always try to say they are, he also saw Cigars shaped too. I in my life time  have probably seen  15-20 different  UFO&#39;s, We never got any pictures, though, we were seeing them so often, we would run back in the house to grab the camera and by the time we would get back out side it would be gone, or to far away to get a picture then  we thought we got smart- started carrying a camera, but  it always seemed as though buy the time we got it out of the bag and  ready  aimed to shoot  the object would be gone, some times they would only stay in one place for a few seconds very disapointing, because I know it was none  of the above mentioned man made craft..

This happened approx in Oct. 1975.  I was 19 years old.  It was in the middle of the night, I was sleeping - I was suddenly aware that I appeared to be outside of my house and looking down at my house, I remember seeing the roof of my house and the street below me, then I saw a silvery side of a disk shaped classic flying saucer - my condition was not at all what I would call normal, I felt I wasnt simply dreaming - it had a very real aspect yet I was sort of out of touch with what was happening, a good description was I felt like a bystander - which is hard to describe or even understand.  I next recall encountering a man, and United States Air Force officer in full uniform, he had black hair and seemed alittle angry - He spoke as an american english, slighly overweight, and was yelling at &#39;others&#39; later I think I may have said something to this person and he was mad because I was &#39;awake&#39;? - I seemed to be floated around inside what appeared to be the outer parimeter of this craft and placed on some sort of operating table.   Then I had the awareness that they were performing some sort of brain operation! - this caused me TONS of mental and spiritual discomfort, anguish and FEAR... I felt that during this time I was outside my body and was watching from behind the &#39;surgeons&#39; - I was incredulous and shocked at this experience wondering AT THAT TIME was this really real? was it really happening?  I recall hearing their voices, but I dont know what they were saying. That seems to be the extent of it, or at least, it is all that I recalled happening.  I &#39;awoke&#39; the next day fully aware of what I had just experienced and KNEW that there was NO WAY I could EVER reveal this to ANYONE EVER... It was just too incredible.  I was very scared at the whole experience.  This happened in 1975, October.  Years later, when I read Whitely Striber&#39;s Communion, I had a terrible shock that this &#39;dream&#39; may have not been a dream after all, and could have been a real experience, it was one line he inserted in his book at the end of a chapter he said somthing like: &#39;they implanted something in my brain!&#39;  THAT realization, that my experience may have been TRUE was almost too much for me to handle... I have since reconciled this and wanted to express this and see if there are any others in the area who had similar experiences at that time?  Thank you for this forum...<n>

Why do I know that all this that follows was not simply a dream?  It didn&#39;t feel like a dream, I felt I was awake but out of normal condition.  Consider this, in a dream state I seem to accept everything that happens no matter how bizarre as &#39;real&#39; but in this incident and all during it I was continually rejecting it, thinking that &#34;this was impossible, this can&#39;t be happening,&#34; and as each level unfolded I continued to be confounded at the content. In short,  I could evaluate which is a higher order of thinking that is beyond dream awareness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, the impossibility got worse as I am somehow transported (floated) up to a classic silver flying saucer! I clearly remember seeing the hull out of the dark, where the two ends converge and I am absolutely stunned, thinking, what the?  This can&#39;t be happening!  That is a flying saucer!  This thing was parked above our house in the dark but I could see it in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And at the next instant I am inside! I see what appears to be a human military man American, I presume, I don&#39;t know the words he is saying but I sense his anger, this man is extremely angry about something.  I later believe that he was possibly mad that I am awake because I may have said something to him or he could see my eyes were open!  I am aware of other human beings United States Military men on board.  I don&#39;t seem to be walking or I can&#39;t feel my legs.  I am transported into the center of the craft and put on a table on my back and doctors surround me and immediately commence brain surgery!  My mind seems to be cracked open and I am seemingly transported to another area, larger space and I feel at this time very afraid as it has gone from impossible to unfathomable and I am simply overwhelmed and feel as if I am a whimpering thought of &amp;quot;bodylessness&amp;quot; (a ghost of some kind)!  This operation seems I can hear others conversing but the words are not understandable,! but I can sense their communication amongst themselves. This is the longest period of time and is fuzzy as to details. After some time I seem to lose all consciousness and after more time I wake up in my bed the next morning. The sun is shining and I begin another day at work! But I have immediate recall of the above and I am simply befuddled as to how to understand it. I was shocked by it all! It all had a very real unreal feeling about it but I could not be sure. For the next 30 years or so I would never discuss this with a single soul. I was too scared to admit it for anyone would think I was nuts! The book Communion had a line that solidified for me that it may indeed be real with the line &amp;quot;...and they implanted something in my brain...&amp;quot; after that I was a wreak for the next year or so trying to accept its reality. Finally after 5 or 10 years and then seeing the culture start to talk about this kind of thing (the Simpsons had scenes of people being abducted u! p into space ships and more people started coming out with sim! ilar sto ries) then I started to lighten up about it. Now I can freely discuss it without too much distress.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some interesting points: The album cover by Emerson Lake and Palmer really keyed me in at the time: &amp;quot;Brain Salad Surgery&amp;quot; that painting depicted very well what I felt was similar to the experience in some form. There was a robotic feeling about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The man in the ship, I later saw a photo of General Curtis Lemay and I swear the fellow on board looked so much like that man that I think it was him!  At that time (1975) there had not been any reports of anything like this happening to people, being sucked up into a flying saucer! Surgery?! So I was not influenced by anything from the culture, this was totally new and totally unexpected.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was apparently unharmed. Just a bit freaked out as we say! No physical evidence was noted on myself, I didn&#39;t even look for any.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is about it, I wanted to report it officially somewhere so it can go into the record. I don&#39;t seem to have any recollection of anything like this happening to me before or since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was approximately 1000 ft off the ground, and larger than her 5 bedroom, 2 story home.  It was circular and a dull metal color, like pewter, with a compartment beneath lit up by lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 5 minutes, it started moving slowly, and it was scanning a creek behind her home with a red, transparent light disc which was directly in the water and moved in sync with the craft.  I still wonder what they were looking for.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about ten minutes, it slowly moved away from her house, and we got in the car and proceeded to follow it.  It stopped over a local farm where we could not gain access.  It then emitted a noise sounding like three jet airplanes preparing to take off, then darted up diagonally, and in five seconds, was no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was it, I never saw it again, and I will never forget it as long as I live.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although source of report does not indicate that fact.

There were 4-5 flashing lights hovering around in one spot for a few minutes then all of a sudden they shot off in different directions at &#34;Star Trek&#34; speed. They were pretty far up and because it getting dark I could not see any particular shape. I told my mother and her reply was &#34;oh Really&#34;?, confirming what I saw but I think she was unsure on whether to believe me. I know what I saw and I am certain it was not from this earth. It is not an absolute date listed, I could be off a year or 2. But it did happen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/1/75 22:00|Maricopa|AZ|Changing|20 min|Group of 4 Orange Objects land near hills just west of small town of Maricopa Arizona... Oct, 1975|1/21/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60648.html|32|ndxe197510| Group of 4 Orange Objects land near hills just west of small town of Maricopa Arizona... Oct, 1975<n> <n><n> <n><n> Objects first appeared as bright orange lights like flares dropped from parachutes in formation.  We knew they weren&#39;t flares when two objects on opposite sides of the formation simultaneously rose several hundred feet above the other two center objects.  The strangeness continued when the intense orange light disappeared from each and was replaced by three white circular lights in a triangle. They seemed to emit smoke but it was likely from super heating of the air around the lights in the cool night. The objects drifted out into the flats and landed about 1/4 mile away right in the backyard of a local ranch house in the desert lighting up the whole place. My girlfriend started running into the desert at the objects but we caught her and all walked to a better vantage point(a few weeks or months after our sighting T.Walton ran up on one too - bad idea).  We watched the objects on the ground and one of them kept going up and down, six - ten feet into the air.  Reminded me of the dance of the bees... The objects were smaller than the house, perhaps 20 feet in diameter.  The lights went dark after a time and we never saw them leave.  About a week or two later one of the witnesses and myself walked up around the hill where the objects were first seen and found a mutilated steer that had not been touched by coyotes or buzzards which were very numerous in the area.  At the time we had never heard of cattle mutilations and did not seriously connect the two events. We were never able to approach the ranch house to ask what the hell went on that night as they had very big dog that chased us away whenever we ventured too near.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
10/1/75 21:00|Kincheloe Air Force Base, Michigan|MI|Triangle|15 seconds|Shaped like the letter "A", flew directly over top of us at est 500 ft.|2/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/011/S11874.html|33|ndxe197510| Shaped like the letter &#34;A&#34;, flew directly over top of us at est 500 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was with my mother, she was driving southbound on I-75 from Saul Ste Marie, Ca.  I looked up and saw what looked like a large letter &#34;A&#34; moving directly over top of us from left to right at about 75 to 100 Mph.  It was approx. 500 feet above us and it had really neat lights on it, red, blue, green, bright red.  It was moving from east to west.  I only saw it for about 15 seconds and it disappeared.  &#34;Not quickly&#34; I merely couldn&#39;t see it any more because of the trees around our car.  My mother and I went home and told my father (A B-52 Gunner at the time) and he &#34;dismissed it as being an airplane&#34;.  I have since spent 10 years in the Air Force as a KC-135 In flight Air Refueling Boom operator instructor from 1986-1996, I have refueled over 5,000 airplanes in flight and have never seen anything like the craft I saw that night.  I am currently a police officer in the state of Washington. I do not know anything more so contact with me isn&#39;t needed.<n>
10/1/75 15:30|Waterloo (Belgium)||Sphere|3 minutes|Dull metallic 9-inch sphere follows perfectly linear path at 5-10 mph about 50 feet AGL.|3/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108018.html|34|ndxe197510| Dull metallic 9-inch sphere follows perfectly linear path at 5-10 mph about 50 feet AGL<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t remember the exact date of the sighting, but my guess is around October 1975 at around 3:30 in the afternoon (after school), when I was living in Waterloo, Belgium.  I would have been 15 years old, and was shooting baskets in my driveway when I looked up and saw a metallic-looking sphere float silently over my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was an “A” student and was somewhat of an astronomy and airplane enthusiast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve sent an accompanying map with an inset showing what the sphere looked like to ufocntr@nwlink.com.  I found a photo of a doll on the Internet (called “Baby Catch-a-Ball”) that my then 13-year-old sister owned, which I remember looked almost identical to the object.  The object was a dull metallic grey and looked perfectly spherical.  It did not reflect or “glint” in the sunlight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be about 9 inches in diameter (i.e., larger than the toy ball).  It followed a perfectly straight line, maintained constant elevation, and made no sound.  I would estimate it was traveling at around 5-10 mph, and therefore I was able to follow it easily for a couple of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the map, I show the path of the object.  It was probably at an altitude of 50 feet AGL and passed almost directly over my head.  What was odd about it was that it traced an absolutely linear path – so I ruled out a balloon or something that could be influenced by air currents.  I don’t remember there being any wind that day, so its constant speed and altitude were a bit alarming.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was also odd in that it did not make any sound whatsoever and was able to maintain its constant heading and altitude at such a low speed.  I was able to follow it until its silhouette disappeared as it passed the other side of a house (about four doors down and around a corner).<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it was almost directly overhead, I remember being tempted to pick up a small rock and throw it at the object, but then I decided against it for fear I would incite some sort of harmful response.  I also remember not calling out to my mother, who was inside the house, for fear of scaring her.  So I never told her or anyone else about it.<n>
