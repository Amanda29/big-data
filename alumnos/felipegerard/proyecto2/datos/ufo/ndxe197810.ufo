Stopped car to take picture and the object slowed and stopped and left at an excelerated speed. Have never reported to any national group but did report to Monroe, N.C. police dept. I am a trained R&amp;D scientist and with flight time and I cannot explain what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a 51 year old R&amp;D scientist who has worked for over 25 years with fortune 500 companies (2). The nite that we saw the object was a ver normal evening and my wife and I with the 2 kids went to Monroe to get groceries after a day at work. Coming home I noticed a bright beam of light coming straight down froma an object in the sky and proceded to analyze what I was looking at, but could not explain the object. Having my oldest daughter in the back seat I asked her to look in the sky and describe what she saw (@5 years old). She described the oval disk with the ring of red light around the side and the beam of light coming down but not touching the ground. My wife also saw the object as described. We stopped the car and I attempted to get my 35mm camera from the trunk but was not quick enough and the object stopped as if reading my mind and proceded to star to move away. In an instant it was a streak across the sky and became a white dot that transversed the sky in seconds. I am not crazy and don&#39;t drink or do drugs but when you tell people this story they wonder. I called the Monroe airport to check for traffic and there had been none and ther were ni clouds for bouncing images. Aperfest cool clear fall nite. Have carried this event for years and finally decided to tell this tale so others will know!! The object was absolutely silent.<n>

It was shaped like a (vitamin capsule) not really cigar shape more full. The object rose over a hill where I was looking for elk and sat just above the horizon for about 10 mins then kind of faded away. The object was huge maybe 300 feet long and 100 feet high. I was looking from the north but the object was a shiny as if it was in full sun. It rose very slowly almost as if a cloud. I&#39;m curious if objects like this have been seen before all I seem to hear about are discs and lights. This was real!<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said above I was elk hunting in the late fall of 1978 about 4 miles south of Virginia City, Montana. It must have been about 1600 or 1630. I was sitting on a south facing slope looking across a small valley perhaps 500 yards across. I was scanning the sparce timber just below the horizon when a huge (vitamin capsule shaped) object perhaps 300 feet long and 100 feet high, it may have been larger but those proportions are pretty close, and I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t smaller. The object was more shiny than metal it looked like mylar, or a mirror, in reflectance but seemed hard surfaced. The side I was looking at was facing north with the sun behind and to the right of it, but not visible, yet the object was as shiny as if it were in full sunlight. It was the brightest thing in the sky, much more intense than the sky. It seemed to rise very slowly and as it was doing so didn&#39;t alarm me, it was as if I were a child watching a cloud rise over a hill. As it rose up from behind the hill slowly it rose to a point maybe 100 feet above the horizon then gradually decended until part of it was below the horizon meaning it was on the north side of the ridge I was looking at giving me a sense of the scale against the hillside. I had no emotional reaction just ho hum which when looking back seems really strange. Anyway I sat there and watched the object for what must have been 10 minutes and honestly I don&#39;t remember how it disappeared. I just remember thinking that I had better leave to get back to the car before dark because I still had a ways to drive on an unimproved road before getting home.  That is another strange thing I then remember being about 200 yards from the sighting place causually walking down the trail totally unconcerned, not looking over my shoulder to see if it re-appeared or anything. When I got home I don&#39;t even think I told my wife which really puzzles me in retrospect. Normally we talked about everything. I am very curious as to whether any other people have seen an object such as this as it seems ! like all I hear about is saucer shaped objects or lights.<n>

A bright oval light move across the sky at speeds that make it cross the sky in about ten sec. It was the brightest thing in the sky.  WE all looked up an to our surprize to see it stop and not move for 2sec. then take a 90 degree turn. Over the next hr. we saw 4 more do the same in the same spot as if it was a 4 way stop sign in the sky  All made a 90 degree turn comeing from different area of the sky. To this day I alway look up to the sky to the nnw at 10 o,clock high  from Birmingham,Al..<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was pretty cold that night and the air was clear.  As we were driving west on Rte. 101 I noticed a large object in the sky moving slowly from north to south.  I pointed it out to my companions and we pulled over and got out of the car to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we stopped the object stopped moving. It appeared to be at least a mile or two away and was very large, about the size of a silver dollar held at arm&#39;s length. It was at about 10 o&#39;clock from the horizon. It was an elongated oval shape and perpendicular to the ground. I seemed to have a bump on one side. The object was glowing purple and the raised area was glowing red. There were two rows of orange or yellow lights on the oval part that were flashing in opposite directions around the oval. The overall shape reminded me of one of those children&#39;s tops with the lever that you push up and down to make it spin except slightly flatter and on its side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched the object for about 10-15 minutes as it hung there in the sky.  While we were stopped, someone in a pickup truck stopped and asked if we needed help.  We explained what we were doing. He had a CB radio in his truck and I could hear other people on the CB chattering about the object.  He looked with us for a minute or two and left.  We finally decided to go ourselves as the object was just hanging there.  When we started moving the object continued moving slowly south and eventually passed from view.  It moved a little slower than an airplane and seemed to move at a steady speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got back to Nashua my band mate&#39;s girlfriend was waiting up for us.  She was nearly hysterical.  She had been out at a dance class and on her way home had apparently encountered the same object except that it was directly overhead and low to the ground.  She said that it covered the whole sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surprisingly or perhaps not, there was nothing about this in any of the local papers even though there were many, perhaps hundreds of witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

10/15/78 21:00|Haena, Kauai|HI|Light|5 minutes|Six bright blue light orbs dance above the ocean just off Haena, Kauai in 1978.|4/24/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108865.html|6|ndxe197810| Six bright blue light orbs dance above the ocean just off Haena, Kauai in 1978<n> <n><n> <n><n> One evening in mid-October of 1978, while I was staying at a friend’s beach shack at Haena, Kauai, I was outdoors enjoying the calm, mild weather surrounded by a group of perhaps 15-20 tourists, campers and local hippie types.  Suddenly, half a dozen or so bright blue lights appeared out over the ocean, perhaps an eighth of a mile off shore.  When I pointed them out, each person stopped to watch in amazement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were orb-like in shape and appeared relatively small from that distance, and they seemed to be dancing with one another like fireflies.  They swirled about each other at a constant speed, similar to the way summer gnats do.  Though it was a dark night, we could see the lights moving in and out of an overhead cloud that was heavy enough to obscure them when they flew into it.  They continued to move in and out of the cloud, randomly swirling about.  They made no sound whatsoever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This phenomenon simply astounded me, and I ran along the shore telling everyone, “Look! Do you see those lights?  What are they?!”  Nobody had an answer.  They just froze in place and kept watching.  When I finally asked an older Hawaiian man these questions, he said, calmly, “Oh, those are just the fishermen’s lights.”  I asked what he meant, and said that the lights were up in the air and not coming from any boats.  He said, “We&#39;ve seen these lights for many, many years here, and we just call them the fishermen’s lights.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about five minutes, the lights faded from view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stayed up very late watching the skies, but I never saw them again.  During that last week of my stay on Kauai, I kept asking everyone I met if they had ever seen these lights.  Few had. But several older hippies who lived way back in Kalalau Valley said the Air Force was constantly chasing things out over the ocean in that direction, and that they’d heard plenty of rumors about UFO sightings, especially over the ocean between Kauai and Ni’ihau.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m almost 60 years old and I remain haunted by this experience, which has never been explained to my satisfaction.  I came to this website looking for any description of a similar occurrence, but found none. Puna area on the Big Island of Hawaii was also known for a rash of UFO sightings by Japanese anthurium farmers during the mid-70s, and there had been several newspaper articles on that topic when I first moved there in 1977.  I was told by the late Dr. Graham Odgers, Canadian head of the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope project, that a famous international UFO committee (of which he was a long-time member) held its annual meeting in Hakalau on Big Island in 1979.  I remain convinced that something serious and quite mysterious has been going on out there for a very long time.<n>

I happen to look outside and saw a large white light travelling to the southeast.  I yelled for my sister and her husband, we went outside to get a better look.  Seeing the light was astonishing, but we were concentrating on the light so much that we did not see at first the most astonishing part of the whole episode, behind the light ( it was hard to distinguish how far behind the light they were) was approxmitely 4 jets following the light.  We watched for around 2 min. until they disappeared.  I followed the newspapers, radio and tv for the next week, but could find anything mentioning what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/15/78 19:30|Port St. Joe|FL|Circle|10-15 minutes|Sighting In Florida|12/7/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53258.html|8|ndxe197810| Sighting In Florida<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never told anyone about this, mainly because of the circumstances, and the only other one that knows is the person I was with. Anyway, I was a sophomore in high school and I was with my girlfriend and I obviously didn&#39;t have a car, and we wanted to make out. We lived within a block of one another and two blocks down the street was a small playground, so we would go down there because there were no lights, so it was extremely dark, except when the moon was out, which it wasn&#39;t this night or we wouldn&#39;t have went. there was a small merry-go-round I think it&#39;s called. and we would sit on it and kiss and stuff. We were going at it when all of a sudden there was all this light coming from above us. It looked like this thing was right above the tree tops (there were alot of trees there), and it was weird, because you could see this thing, it was round and had different colored lights going around on the bottom with one big white round light in the middle, but what was weird about it was it was blowing the treetops apart so it could see us, but it didn&#39;t make a sound. You would think the trees would have a rustling sound or something, but there was no noise at all, I&#39;ll never forget it. It scared the hell out of us and we ran. There was a small three hole practice golf course across the road where people took golf lessons and perpendiculur to that a small canal that had a small bridge. We ran for our lives because we were so scared and when we ran, this &#34;thing&#34; followed us so I told my girlfriend to run towards the bridge and I was going to run across the golf course unless it followed her, then I was going to follow her to. Then when we split up this thing stopped, like it was confused and didn&#39;t know which way to go and I was looking over my shoulder and saw this and I stopped and then it just zipped away in the opposite direction like some kind of cartoon or something and I yelled at my girlfriend who was still running and she turned around and stopped and then turned back towards me an! d we reu nited and was walking home not really knowing what to say, but we agreed not to say anything because we figured everyone would think we were nuts, because back then this kind of thing was sort of unheard of, not like today, but most importantly because of what we were doing there, we didn&#39;t want to get in trouble. So, that&#39;s it. One thing I would like to add. I was watching a show about ufos on tv and I saw this story about these police officers chasing a ufo in I think it was Ohio and they showed and gave a description of the ufo that they saw, and I think that was the one where it was round with multi-colored lights. If I have the right one, I really can&#39;t remember (the one on tv), but that is exactly what we saw, exactly. It was eerie watching it, because it happened so long ago it seemed unreal until I saw the ufo special on tv. Anyway, that&#39;s my story, and I&#39;d really rather not name names and stuff cause a.) I don&#39;t want anyone thinking I&#39;m crazy, I don&#39;t really believe in anything, unless there&#39;s some kind of proof and even though I know what I saw, I still don&#39;t know what to think about it, and b.)my girlfriend back then, it&#39;s up to her to tell if she wants, personally I can understand if she doesn&#39;t. There&#39;s a reason I never told anyone about it and it&#39;s because no one would probably believe me.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I was interested in UFOs and felt most were explainable and I was uncertain about the rest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were renting a house from my parents which is on the north side of Coeur d&#39; Alene Lake, four miles east of Coeur d&#39; Alene, Idaho.  We had just eaten dinner and walked out onto the front deck which overlooked the lake.  It was after sunset and still light outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were looking out over the lake when a greenish-white glow appeared under the surface of the water.  An object raised vertically out of the water, water running off, it was oval and difficult to make out the exact outline of the object due to the light it gave off and was about the size of a semi-trailer which is only a rough guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object rose vertically for an estimated several hundred yards to where it was above our horizontal line of site and southwest of us.  The object stopped for a second or two and the next thing we saw was a straight white tapering line of white light going from the last point we saw the object going horizontally out over the northwest horizon as a thread thin white line. It appeared that whatever it was accelerated instantly to a speed that made it appear like a straight white bolt of lightning, only that it tapered to invisibly thin over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally never talked to anyone about this until three years after the event occurred because I was so shocked by how unreal it was and that my mind had no reference for such an event such as objects raising from a lake vertically and then zipping off horizontally like a lightning bolt.  We heard no sound whatsoever from whatever this was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never even heard of reports like mine from anyone, so it has now been an unsolved puzzle in my mind for over thirty years that has only served to make me wonder what on earth is going on and only fueled my quest for knowledge on the subject of UFOs which, as a scientist/engineer, I take very very seriously and would love to see the human race as a whole get to the bottom of this and with full open cooperation of universities and governments, which unfortunately has not happened and is a disgrace.<n>
10/15/78 18:00|Shelby Township|MI|Disk|25 minutes|Witnessed 2 Mich State Troopers run from close encouter of second kind.|6/10/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29127.html|10|ndxe197810| Witnessed 2 Mich State Troopers run from close encouter of second kind<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not sure of the date.  It was Oct, could be Oct. &#39;77 or &#39;79.  This is 1 of several sightings that I have had and the last to be what I consider extra-terrestrial.  I just got done bowling from my Tuesday bowling league. I was going to a bar right after that to have a few beer with a friend of mine and discuss the upcoming Lions game.  Actually both of us were were more interested in the gal working behind the bar.  Anyways, I left the bowling ally and proceeded north to my destination.  Nice evening.  Sun still up.  Beautiful fall day.I went about a 1/4 mile and all  of a sudden my FM radio started making a hissing noise that I never heard on the radio before.  I pushed the buttons set to different frequencys and got the same hiss.  I took the tuner button and manually turnd the radio throughout the whole FM band and all I got was the same noise.  Then I tried the same thing on the AM band to no avail.  I thought my radio was broke being I got the same noise on both bands all the way through both bands.  I got to the bar I was headed for and parked facing south.  One more time I tried to go through the Am band and all of a sudden the Am band started fading in.  Just as this happemed I noticed something in my peripheral a few hundred yards moving south.  It was below 500 ft altitude and I heard no sound as it passed by me.  I couldn&#39;t see it as it passed by me in the parking lot because it was almost directly overhead.  It hit me that this craft was putting out some kind of electromagnetic interference.  Next thing that hit my mind was to identify the craft so I got out of the car.  The craft was gaining altitude then leveled off at no more than 1,000 ft.  I got a very good look, no wings, no rotor, no gondola.  Just a disk shaped object, big red light on top of the dome, all kind of flashing lights on the edge.  Looked like something out of a Spielberg movie.  This was no plane, helicopter, ballon or even marsh gas.  I could clearly see the edge of the disk did not come to a point but was about 4 1/4 feet thick at the edge.  I would like to point out at this time I am a vetran of naval aviation and familiar with identifying air craft.  I worked on fligt lines on naval air stations, air force bases, and the air craft carrier John F. Kennedy pre flighting air craft, launching, recovering, and maintaining aircraft. I worked as an aviation fire control bombing technition in a photo recon squadron.  I was also in an electronic warfare squadron where I also worked in radio communication, radio navigation and electronic warfare systems.  I believe I knew what I saw and what was happening. By the way, that is the only time the radio in that car didn&#39;t work.  Next thing I knew my friend was hollering from behind me, &#34;Did you see those lights?&#34;  I told him I could still see them.  The object was heading south about 1/2 mile away at that time.  Then by chance another friend and his wife happened to drive up and park. First friend said he saw the craft enter the atmosphere from many miles up, more miles higher than any plane could ever fly.  He said it came down below treetop level.  That is where I first saw it, rising from a field where I used to play little league baseball.  That is about the time I saw it as it was gaining altitude and going south. Second friend and his wife happened to be coming home from visiting the wife&#39;s mother and thought they were watching a planecrash.  I pointed the object out to them. Their jaws dropped wide open.  Many people saw this.  Next to show were State Police.  They saw people milling around, stopped  and we had a short conversation something like this: Cops-  &#34;What is everybody looking at?&#34;  Me- &#34;A ufo, sir&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cops- laughing and making coments about little green men.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Me- &#34;Do you want to see the ufo?&#34;  Cops- &#34;Yes!&#34;  Me- &#34;Then turn your heads and look out the windshield.&#34;  End of conversation because when they turned their heads to look, they saw, then their jaws dropped wide open.  Then suddenly for a split second they looked at each other.  Next thing they did was simultainiously roll their squad car windows shut and proceed down the road approaching close to 100 mph.I never saw the objct do more than 20 mph. I&#39;m starting to think I whised that I was with them because by the time they got a half mile down the road they got a nice close look, but then all of a sudden they slamed on the brakes and ducked into a restaurant for coffee and doughnuts. So my friends and I had to chase it down ourselves.  We kept up with it for almost 20 minutes until we lost sight of it.   I talk to very few people abouy ufos<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Slept on beach quite a bit. Dont remember much from there but i have a recurring dream that an alien space craft had appeared out of no where and everyone on the beach scattered screaming. I am now 40.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 19 i went to an infertility specialist they opened me up and discovered a fallopian tube and ovary missing. The other was deformed.  When out of surgery the doctors questioned me about it. I had not had any previous surgeries of any kind yet my ovary and fallopian tube were surgically removed. They said they know it was surgically removed because if i had been born without them there would not have been a space where they once were. My body would not have made room for organs that were not there.  On the inside there was evidence i was operated on but not on the outside-ANYWHERE. I was told i would never have children but amazingly enough 7 years later i did, who is now 15 and wins many awards for her scientific mind.(my family history is of artists no scientists any where) Oddly enough She has wanted to be a scientist since she was 3 and still does at 15 and is well on her way in school for gifted. I have seen 2 ufo&#39;s in my life both were in arizona, i saw one while i was driving east on gilbert road during broad daylight on a clear day, sun bouncing of shiny object in sky caught my attention. And i witnessed the phx lights with my daughter over south mountain. We lived in the foothills and were coming home from a movie driving west on ray road towards south mountain.  I saw it and pointed it out to my daughter both of us &#34;wowing&#34; at them, then we get home its all over the news we were glad we werent the only ones to see them. This is something that i dont tell for fear of ridicule and dont want people poking at my kid like she is a freak<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

It hovered.|11/8/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47498.html|14|ndxe197810| A saucer shaped ship was seen from about 50 yards away.  It hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That evening I saw bright lights in my window through closed dark curtains.  I opened the curtains to view a perfect flying saucer. It was shinny, like seemless stainless stell, or chrome.  It was still daylight, so it was crystal clear, and a beautiful day.  It was approaching dusk, so the light was perfect.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The ship hovered directly over my neighbors house, which was directly across the street. It had round or oval lights runninig around the bottom, and a blue mist drifting from the center bottom area.  This was daylight so the blue light was only clearly visible when it moved up, and away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw the disk I stood inshock for a minute, but then I ran into my parent&#39;s room (wher they were laying with my little sister with them watching TV) and screamed to them to come look.  When we opened the front door the ship was still above the neighbor&#39;s home, but started to move east after a 30 second viewing by my 3 other shocked witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It took off West, but then zoomed striaght up at dramatic speeds, and then zig zagged off onto the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Just as a lark I decided to point my flashlight at the object and went round and round -- really fast.  The light started changing -- different colors and really bright.  I was amazed!.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An airplane flew really close to the object, passed it, and when it was way ahead, the light darted at the plane.  This happened twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well I kept watching playing with my flash light and the light started moving my way. It came closer until it was above my head.  The object was shaped like a triangle, with a light on each corner. It made no noise -- none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It scared me so bad I ran to the neighbors house and pretended I was just visiting.  I didn&#39;t tell them what I had seen because I was afraid they would think I was crazy.  When I came out after about 15 minutes I saw the object moving slowly toward the south west.<n>

When we arrived at her house my parents went in to see my grandmother. There was some neighbor kids wanting me and my two sisters  to play football with them in a field beside my grandmothers house there was 8 of us in all between the ages of 8 and 15.It was a beautiful day the sky was a carolina blue no clouds at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all started playing football we had been playing for about 1 hour when suddenly I noticed everyone gazing up toward the sky.  And when I looked up I frooze I could not move or speak neither could anyone eles at this point.There was a dark gray disk shaped object above our heads.It could not have been more the 20 feet off the ground it was so close that my skin started to burn,it was hovering right above us no sound could be heard there was lights around the bottom portion of this object that moved it a circle manner and they were white and green.I was so scared but for some reason we could not move at all.There was two windows at the top of a dome located at the very top of this object and I noticed a human like figure wearing a white looking coat standing at the window looking back at us.I could see a green light on the inside and I could see human like figures moving around inside the object.There was also a beam of light shooting down at the ground and at this point I felt like I could move again so I started running toward my grandmothers house and so did everybody eles as I look back I saw this object move so quickly in between two trees than it sped off so fast it had to been faster than any aircraft I had ever seen before.I dont believe in little green men but this was far more interesting than anything I or any other people that say it that day had ever seen.I was 8 years old at the time and Im 35 now and have never seen anthing as strange as that was.What is weird about this is the fact Im allergic to certain! light h itting my skin.I cant get in tanning beds or anything with ultraviolent light,And as for everybody eles we talk about what we saw every now and than but it was such a weird experience that we all have trouble trying to comperhend what we saw was even real.I really wish we could have taken a picture or a video because it would have been one of the most closes encouters of a UFO ever fimed or video taped.Im really glad I could share my storey you because its really hard living with the fact you saw something like this.<n>

They made light of it and took pictures of the lights at the brighton SKI LODGE. and the picture they took looked like what we saw. As i say it was foggy and if not for the fog we would have seen nothing. As i was driving  we saw lights over US 23, and we could see the lighhts bounceing off the fog, the shape was round, and the lights were going in a circle, we could not see the craft that was making the lights but the light reflecting off the fog showed it was round. me and my girlfriend saw it and many others saw it that were driving by that night. it is strange because they could have said it was a ZEPPLIN, or a weather thing, but all they did was take pictures of two spot lights at the ski lodge and laff AT every one because the pictures they took looked like what we saw, but the fact is, the lights went round and round, and reflected off the fog. I saw it, my girlfriend saw it, and so did every one else that slowed down that night to look at it. I do not tell any one anymore about this, i had enought bull from the brighton argust. I would like to know where they got the picture they had in the newspaper. The UFO, was going towards Howell michigan, as i was going south on US 23 between brighton and Ann Arbor, I know what i saw, Lights going in a circle reflecting off the fog, it was about 30 feet by 30 feet, at my best guess. that is 30 feet round, or 3 to 4 cars, or if ya want this it covered my side of the express way, the median also. that is all i know other than the brighton argust made a fool out of every one. it was going about 10 miles an hour or less. i had lots of time to look at the lights. if you can find out what this was (for sure) i would like to know. But I bet ya can&#39;t, i know what i saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I still remember the details like it was yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a long ship like the size of a football field.  It was also tall like 30 or 40 feet tall.  It had windows from top to bottom.  I could see inside there were people walking around.  It was about 600 ft away from me.  I was driving in a car with my friend.  I was in the front passanger seat.  I asked her to stop the car so she could see what I was talking about.  She was denying my claims.  I was shouting to her to stop the car but she wouldn&#39;t.  She seemed like she was in a trance.  I still remember this as if it were yesterday.<n>
10/6/78 21:45|Nuriootpa (Australia)||Fireball|45 seconds|Fireball inclour size  approximately 500 yards across, landed and vertically lifted out of sight|8/16/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24130.html|20|ndxe197810| Fireball inclour size  approximately 500 yards across, landed and vertically lifted out of sight<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the evening the object was spotted I was a young man working on my car in my fathers shed, the evening sky was black , no moon, and very claer. During the evening out in the shed i realised I needed parts from a an old car we had stoered in the back yard. opening the sliding door and walking into the blackness of the evening I initailly focussed my attention on the ground to avoid falling over any objects, after a while my attention went to the back of the yard, looking up I saw the object. The object consumed the evening sky and the paddoch behind my fathers farm, 20 years on I can still clearly see the immense size and clour when I recall the sighting. The object was a fireball orange, against the evening blackness it stood out very clearly, The size of the object was as large as a football field, it had 3 d qualities so I assume it was round in shape, It had no distingushing features on its surface only the intense orange glow, It was landed on the ground approxiamtely half a mile away in a clearing,The instant i focussed upon the object it very slowly lifted itsself off the ground, the sheer size and toital lack of any sound still haunts me, The object stabilised then very smoothly and quickly accerated in a vertical line. It was very obvious the object had the ability to accerate quickly, the time to see it and watch it begin to acler to apoint wher it was stable above the groond was approxiamtely 5 seconds, the rate of climb was very uniform and the rate of acceration was noticably faster as each second passed. I remember seing this object in its immense form and watching it dissaper into a dot so small it was not visible. I can still recal the entire event and felt the cold feeling of fear due to not understanding over come me. The entire event lasted 45 seconds from sart to finsish but changed my perception of what is possible in life forever. The corny ending to this story if Im allowed to share it with you is that working on an old truck for my boss about a year after the event recalled eve! ry detai l as explained by 2 old women in book found under the front seat of the truck. The vent detailed inthe UFO book( I still do not understand how or whay I needed to find the book in a truck explained what 2 lovely old ladies had seen one night in your country. It detailed every thing I had seen, the decription of colour , size and its path away from them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object I saw left no possible doubt in my mind and to date the story when argued with sceptics leaves me wondering what did land on a paddoch one night very close to my fathers farm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

It was completely dark and we were far away from any citylights. The onely things preventing us from having a good look at it were the highwaylights and (for me) the fact that I was driving the car at 70 m/ph. I thank the Lord that my mother still has her good mind (I&#39;m writing this in the year 2001 when my mother has reached the age of 86) so she still is a reliable whitness to what we&#39;ve seen and can tell people we&#39;re not crazy or seeing things. The thing we saw just hang there on the left of the highway and had blinking lights all around it. I still remember it were green, red and yellow lights, randomly burning. As we rode along the highway (A7) towards Amsterdam, the object seemed to go in the same direction with a reduced speed. My mother and I saw this thing for about two minutes, while talking to each other about it. We both agreed it could not be a plane, helicopter or whatever we thought of. When this UFO (for us it was the only term we could think of) suddenly took of with a velocity that scared us, we were convincend the thing we saw was not of this world. I&#39;m ready to swear on the bible that what i just wrote is the truth (while excusing myself for any errors in the writing) and so is mother.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I noticed what appeared to be &#34;airplane&#34; lights (wing tip red and green) in the night sky to my left (east).  However, I then noticed that the green light was angled downward and appeared to be decending.  I was approximately eight miles north of Francesville, IN at the time.  I continued to watch these two lights.  As I got closer to Francesville, the lights got lower.  As I pulled into town, I observed these lights to be approximatly 100 to 150 feet above ground.  What I had first thought to be one green light was, in fact, a multitude of green lights on the front of the craft.  The craft appeared to be approximatly four (4) stories in height and was approximatly two (2) blocks long.  What had appeared to be a &#34;red&#34; light was an apparent exhaust port and appeared to be approximately fifty (50) feet wide.  There appeared to be some type of structure on the outer shell of the craft, however, I could not tell for sure.  This craft stopped and hovered over Francesville, IN for approximately five (5) minutes.  There was absolutely no sound.  After approximately five (5) minutes the object angled upward by approximately one or two degrees and continued on a westerly course toward Rensselaer, Jasper County, IN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
