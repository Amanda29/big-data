They were so unlike anything he had ever seen, he was certain they were UFOs.  The sincerity with which he described the experience greatly impressed my mother and me.  Unfortunately, my uncle died shortly after that experience, and that is all the information my mother and I have about the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
