The first 3 were all seen more to the southern portion of the sky and then travelled east at about 3-4 times the speed of an aircraft. There was an aircraft in the sjy around the same time. There were no flashing lights and the light was steady, no twinkling.  One made a 90 degree maneuver at one point.  They eventually diminished in size and dissapeared.  The next 4 appeared anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes apart and they all had the same similar location of origin but they would at first appear very large before diminishing to nothing.  Compared to the Large Red star in the southern sky (Mars? - Planet??) that was visible that night it would have been almost twice as large.  They moved very fast and dissapeared from sight in almost 10-15 seconds.  They were not comets or meteors or stars.  We were not convinced they were ships but they were definitely unusual.  The light appeared &#34;smooth&#34; in the sky as opposed to a plane when moving (slight jerky or halted motion??).<n>

No sound or vapor trail, no wings or tail structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife and I were gardening in early evening about 12 minutes before sunset.  The sky was clear with very few clouds.  We watched as a cylindrical craft traveled from the SW to NE at a uniform rate of speed, passing overhead just to the south of us.  It had a row of very bright white lights along the side of the body, the body had a very reflective metallic appearance. The craft appeared to be at least 25 diameters in length, a very long cylindrical structure.   It was sufficiently low in altitude so that we could see that it was not a conventional aircraft, no wings, tail or other visible structures.  It progressed uniformly along a straight line path at a bearing of about 20 degrees north of East.  No vapor trail or no emission of sounds.  We frequently watch the many high altitude commercial flights that cross over this area.  This craft did not follow any of the paths usually followed by the airliners.  This craft was much lower and any engine noise should have been noticeable.<n>

I noticed 6 small circle shaped craft, not moving in the sky.  They were well above the small aircraft which was a Cessna. I continued to look as long as I could. I then began looking for the child that I came to the park with.  After locating her I looked back in the sky and trying to re-locate them in order to show them to other people at the park, however they were no longer there.  There is no question in my mind that I saw what I saw.<n>

I was on my back looking up. I was getting a tan. I noticed a small white point of light. It did not look like a plane I retreived my camera which I was using just a few minutes earlier. I notice only one at first. I was a bit nervous and forgot to remove auto focus. I proceeded to film the object. Trying to get a good zoom, when I pulled out I noticed a second object. At first they appearded to be moving apart I keep losing the focus. When I refocused later I notice they were closer and seemed to pass each other at quite a close range. I was thinking to myself if they were planes that would have been a near miss. My girlfriend was also observing the object. I notice the battey was going to die so I positioned myself behind a electircal wire so the object would pass behind an object. I knew that is a good way to do measurements. And to see that the object was actually in the atmosphere. Til the object reached the edge of the fence. After reviewing the film I noticed I actually filmed 3 objects. One of which I did not notice with my naked eye. When you look a the film you will notice the 3rd object on the left of the film in one of the zoom outs of the &#34;2&#34; objects I saw visually. Then a few seconds later on the upper left corner on a few frames. Very faint but very noiceable on the film. 	I was filming the object on a brand new Sony Handycam Model: CCD-TR416 W/180X Zoom and Night Vision. Filmed TDK HS120 Metal Paticle Tape Super Finavinx-Metal Particle 8mm video cassette. Thank you.<n>

This object was very bright, maybe twice as bright as what I think Venus is in the Western sky.  This object moved from directly overhead to 20-30 degrees over the horizon before it faded out.  It took about 1minute maybe slightly longer for this to take place.  I never saw it appear, I just stepped out the door and looked up when I observed it.  Later that night, maybe half an hour later I observed another thing very similar to this only it appeared and dissappeareed in a matter of 5 or 6 seconds.  Both moved far too slow to be shooting stars, and they seemed to be moving far too fast to be conventional aircraft.<n>

IT WAS MOVEING SO FAST IN EVERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION. EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE IT WOULD STOP IN MID FLIGHT, THAN CONTINUE WHAT IT HAD BEEN DOING.

On this night my sister on her way to work observed lights in the sky and called me at home to ask if I had seen this. I looked outside the window and reported nothing unusual,as she was explaining the sight to me I also saw it. My girlfriend and I both ran outside and to the east saw three red,steady lights forming a perfect triangle. As I spoke with her on the cordless phone, red lights began shooting from the main shape..one down,one up and south,one back to the east,and the last to the north very erratic,as if it had lost control or something. Also this last weekend I was explaining to my girlfriend weather formations after dark, and how if you can still see the glow of stars through the clouds,they were not very heavy. We suddenly saw three goose shaped glows,not lights appear in a formation of two to the south and one to the north heading east from the north west over our house. They disappeared immediately, duration was only from 5-20 seconds. The weekend of 6/5/99. Thank you for this site,it lets us all share our stories.<n>

I was hopeing that somebody else beside myself and my fiance&#39; and a neighbor had seen this event.  It was around 9:00 pm on a Saturday.  Our apartment is located a couple of blocks east of the main Las Vegas Strip behind the Sands Convention center. Me and my fiance&#39; were standing out on the balcony looking to the west over the casino area and notice around 9 to 10 bright spherical objects flying in a &#39;V&#39;formation moving relatively slow in a northernly direction. About this time my neighbor of whom works at Macharran Airport was walking up the stairs to his apartment.  I pointed the objects out to him and mentioned to him that those weren&#39;t air planes and he should know considering that he works at the air port, we watched them for about 3 minutes and they just faded out while moving in a northernly direction.<n>

I believe, though I can&#39;t be certain, that the object which appears in the photograph was not visible before or after I took the picture. I was looking very carefully in that area of the sky and did not see the craft at all. So strictly speaking we have no real-time sighting of the craft to report, only the evidence of the photograph. I have enhanced the photo with my computer and can see no evidence of structure that would identify the object as a plane or helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Digitally transmitted  photograph is intriguing. The image is too small to positively identify it at this time, but it does appear to be on the near side of distant clouds during daylight hours. NUFORC will attempt to post it in the future.))<n>

Has this happened to anybody else?While renting a town home in Half Moon Bay California I was awakened at least three times from my sleep because my room began to light up a brillant Orange color. I would open my eyes and see that the color was getting brighter. I would sit up and look around and then the brillant orange color would start to dim and then fade out altogether. On two occasions I told myself I must be dreaming and went back to sleep. On the third I actually got up and looked out the window because this time the lightrays coming from outside the window into my room seemed to move from my bedroom ceiling down to the floor as if an object outside the window were rising up and over the building yet I heard no sound. By the time I got to the window and looked outside I saw nothing. Each time the lights peeked (to there brightest) after about four seconds and then began to fade and were totally gone about four seconds later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The bright light was indeed close to Mars&#39; brightness. I hadn&#39;t seen many objects move that fast before, but it did shoot off directly into the moon which was in the left of my viewing field. Mars was in my right viewing field (which was my bedroom window!) Hope all is well with you and thank you for your calls.  Hope to see you one of these days when our &#34;trials&#34; are over...…((name deleted))<n>

There must have been five flights of three fireballs each. They eluminated the sky for at least a mile around me. Three fighter jets took off after it in a futile chase. I think they were F-16&#39;s.<n>

I noticed that northbound Washington Road was blocked by a road-closed sign (stating that the road was closed 3/4ths of a mile ahead), the orange kind that are used when construction is taking place.  As I waited for eastbound SR 41 traffic to clear in order to make my right turn, I looked past the road closed sign and to the north toward the point where dump trucks and a (presumably) construction crew was gathered.  In the sky above them was an object that I at first thought was a blimp.  It was metallic or silver in color, looked to be the correct length of a blimp at that distance, but was not tall enough in my estimation to actually be a blimp.  This was in the middle of the afternoon and the sky was perfectly clear.  The object seemed to be floating or hovering over the construction site, at maybe about twice the level of the nearby treetops.  I just sat there for about 1 minute, trying to justify and identify what I was looking at.  I dismissed the blimp idea, and then wondered if this was some sort of weather balloon or something.  I might point out that the location of this object was in a rural setting not far from a small city.  I thought that the folks at the road construction site HAD to see this thing!  I briefly considered driving around the road closed sign, to the construction site as to get a better look, but I convinced myself that I should go ahead and run the errand that I had set out to do and that if when I came back by it was still there then I&#39;d try to investigate.  When I came back by the same area approximately 30-35 minutes later, I could no longer see the object.  A couple of hours later the road closed sign was gone and I drove down northbound Washington road to the point of construction.  It looked like they had been working on grading the roadside ditches and there was nothing that looked out of the ordinary. I&#39;m afraid to make inquires about this locally, since I&#39;ve observed that people that admit that they see UFOs are treated like nutcases.  I&#39;d really like to know if there was a blimp in the area or if that was some sort of weather ballon.  I&#39;d also like to know if the construction crew noticed it overhead.  It seemed pretty unnatural to me and kind of gives me the creeps.<n>

National Park in North Dakota at 10:00 pm I was standing next to my truck and saw what I believed to be a star on the horizon. It was red and glowing like a dwarf but then it changed colors to a blueish white and back to red again and then it moved to the side at a speed which I have never seen an aircraft , including my navy days working with av8b herriers and helicopters of all sorts,achieve I then noticed a dull light eminate from the craft and I felt like I was seeing in negatives. Four times very rythmic it flashed and my eyes saw in negative. It moved again at about the same speed and distance, approxametly 200 yards or so, and then I saw the light again and my eyes flashed in negatives it moved again same speed and distance and then lowered into the badlands behind a butte. I stayed there for a half an hour and it never returned. the butte in question is about a mile or so straight out from the visitor center .<n>

It was highly reflective, with no tail or wing structure, and no variation in the diameter of the rod.  It left no visible trail.  I heard nothing, perhaps because of driving with a dozen other nearby cars on I90. When I first noticed the rod, it was straight ahead and low in the sky.

I thought that it was probably some of the local military boys on a night jump so I pulled over to watch. The formation was approximately 5 lights about one inch apart. They appeared to be several hundred feet in the air. The strange thing was that I saw no vapor trail from the flares I thought were burning. I watched about 30 minutes or so, but the lights never got closer or further from the ground (they appeared as if they were over the water). After about 30 minutes, I got bored and went home, never to think about it until I saw a show on tv last night about the lights that were seen over phoenix several years ago ( a cigar shape that was widely reported). What I saw resembled this same shape. May be a hoax. Wanted to find out if any other reports around this same time were investigated, if so what was it?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Then as I keep looking at them, I notice a color of golden lights. I have always seen strobs and green and red, but, never just one color no matter how high in the sky. Ok, the altitude probably was about 2000 or 3000 but that as they passed me they split as 2 lights to the left and 4 on the right and keeping the same altitude they seemed to just pass at the same speed into the distance. Because it was black in the sky I could not see craft or size of object. Just the lights. They probably were on the rear of the craft and wing trails. Seeing many aircraft coming to wilmington international airport this was a first for me. I also see a lot of aircraft possibly going up the coast to camp legune nc. In this day and time I don&#39;t know if this is some kind of US aircraft of ufo. I just haven&#39;t heard you or Art or anyone speak of any kind of craft with only Gold lights.

I then step back and looked again and said to my wife &#34;what is that next to it?&#34; We then saw a flash like the Sun glinting off metal. It sat at the 9 o`clock position for like 3 mins then shot off towards the left of the Moon but staying about at 9 o`clock. We then decide to try and rush home and see if we see it through binoculars. As we were driving down the street we kept watching for it at stop signs and saw it shoot to the 12 o`clock position above the Moon. We waited and then saw it take off again towards the 9 o`clock position and then disappear. The whole time it was like the Sun was flashing of metal. and it was hovering when we first saw it for like 3 mins.<n>

We were in the back yard sitting by the pool and I was admiring the clear blue sky when I noticed the disc shaped object. We all saw it just hanging there and we all saw it leave at an incredible rate of speed. The next morning back in Tucson we also saw a missle test from White Sands that failed. The news had been broad casting info on the test so we got up at 4:00 am to watch, just thought I would throw that in even though it has nothing to do with the disc sighting.

MOHD FAHMI ABU HASSAN, aged 17, said that the object emitted intense blue light so much so he could not make out the object clearly. He then saw a being about 0.5 meters in height alighting from air. &#34;At that time the light emitted by the object increased and it was difficult to see the creature.&#34; said he here today. UTUSAN (the newspaper)upon searching around the house found seven paw prints about half a centimeter deep. The paw track had four fingers and had sharp claws based on the grip clearly seen from the prints on earth. the student also claimed, UFO was detected first around 4.30 am when he woke up from sleep. MOHD FAHMI said, he woke up upon hearing the zinc roof of his house made loud noise as though being blown by strong winds. &#34;I woke up and found that the wind was blowing as though about rain&#34;, he said. Before this, two incidents involving UFOs rocked the residents of BALING district, in KEDAH STATE and IPOH in PERAK STATE.

I asked her to get a piece of plain paper and a pencil and attemtp to draw  the object she had seen. Afte her rendition, I querried her on regards to the size, speed, direction and other pertenant data regarding the object. She stated: 1-   The craft was the approximate size of the UFO icon used in the welcome screen to your home page 2- The craft was dark on the top and the bottom, having an extremely bright reflective, or lit center 3- the craft traveres the view of my daughter from South to North 4- the sighting took appx. 5-6 seconds( traveling at the appx. speed of comercial(?) aircraft in the sky 5- there were aircraft in the sky at the time of the sighting, traversing the sky from North to South 6- there was other reference to the moon and its location at the time, best guess 30o off horizon, and to the south of the object Therer have not been any other sightings of this type of craft, nor any reports of unusual activity from wither of my children in the past.   My daughter at any time can recall the details of the object, and is not open to suggestion regarding change to the object. This is her first sighting<n>

Peter))<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2:00am I observred what I thought was a single satelite moving north to south.Soon I noticed a multitude of these objects following the first and counted 74 of these objects on the same trajectory within the span of 53 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At 2:10 am Sunday morning May  23rd,I observed what appeared to be a satelite traveling from north to south.It seemed brighter than most I had seen and made note of that to myself.Soon afterwards,I noticed three more of these same lights following the same path.Wow,I thought,looks like the space program got the funding they were after.At this point I scanned a 45 degree arc in the sky from due north to the northeast.I noticed a multitude of these objects within this frame of view.It struck me as very strange at this point and I decided to count the objects just to see if I might be able to explain what I was seeing to a meteorologist or scientist so I could know what the hell I saw.Then ,some of the objects started coming in distinct patterns.Some were triangles,others were following in a straight line. I started to get freaked out because I knew that satelites did not behave in this fashion.I looked to my right (toward the NE) and saw one object that was going from northeast to southwest.It suddenly shifted from that to a straight north-south direction.OK what the hell is going on here!?Some of the lights were very bright and had a bluish tint,others were more dim with a yellowish tint.they all apeeared to move at the same speed though I did see one that sped up and then slowed down.The sky conditions were partly cloudy there were no airplanes in the vicinity.It is interesting to note that they were moving the airport to a new location that morning to Austin Bergstrom International Airport.The airport is south east of me.The new one is even further southeast.At the old airport the planes would fly directly over my apartment at about 500-600 ft.As far as the planes they moved form the old airport to the new,they were flying about 20 of them and would not have gone over my building because the new airport is in the opposite direction.Which leads me to my final observation:I counted 74 fast moving objects  at high altitude for a total of 53 minutes.Does&#39;nt seem conducive to what was going on during the move of the airports.My neck was starting to hurt after awhile and since I did&#39;nt hear any explosions I assumed that we were not under attack and went nervously to bed.<n>

I was the only one to see the trail, though my dad saw the flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dad, uncle (both MUFON members) and I were stargazing the night of 22 May.  We were roughly 4 miles east of Greenwater, Washington on what on the maps is called Huckleberry Mountain, at about 3500 feet. From this vantage point we could see from due east (over some mtns. covering lower 20 deg. of sky) to the NW.  The three of us were regularly looking in different directions.  At 23:15, I was looking to the ESE roughly 45 deg. up, when just below this a very bright meteor- like streak quickly shot nearly straight down (to horizon).  I&#39;m not sure if I saw it from start to finish, but it seemed to only begin 10-20 deg. above the horizon to begin with.  What made this event worth mentioning was the immediate &#39;explosion&#39; after I lost sight of the streak behind a ridge.  I say explosion because it really lit up that part of the sky, enough so that my dad, who was looking in another direction, noticed it as well. Unfortunately my uncle was looking behind us, and did not see any of this.  To me it seemed that this explosion was a double flash, although this did occur in less than a second.  This immediately got all of our attention, and we were silent for a period afterwards in case we could hear a sound from the event, but we never heard anything. After discussing it, we decided that this event was most likely a meteor which either burnt up just before hitting the ground, or perhaps a meteorite which landed in or beyond the Cascades.  The only caveat to this explanation was that I have seen many meteors, though no &#39;bolides&#39;, and this was not the brightest I&#39;ve seen.  I have heard accounts of bolides which actually left a trail, etc., and this did not occur. As for more exact locations and directions, we were located 47 deg 8&#39; N, 121 deg. 34&#39; W, and the flash and explosion occured at a direction of roughly 90-100 degrees.<n>

It was stable (always the same shape) but it was moving very fast (not like a asteroid, slow, but because it&#39;s far, it&#39;s fast...like a far car...you know). It&#39;s not a plane (too far and too big), not a buterfly :o). Normaly i&#39;m septic on everyting about UFOs, but now I trust in. I immediately told Diego my friend about this and he saw it, too. Then it dissapered. We were both fascinated about what we see. Nobody trust us, of course, but I AM SURE OF WHAT I&#39;VE SAW I think the NASA hide the truth..

Stopped on road at Hwy 70 and Bernadette Dr. to look at sky. Facing northeast. Noticed what seemed to be a small whitish cloud captured in a light cloud cover hanging over Columbia. (Stars were visible through clouds.) Then noticed that the little cloud was moving to the north. At first it just looked like a cloud moving through the sky. But as it moved it kept its cambre. It looked like a ship plowing water; the front was raised. AS it got a little closer to us I could see that there was a more brightly lit area at the front. The general appearance was oval.  There was a bright area, a point of light at the front, followed by a lighter area which trailed off in a tail which lengthened and shortened (dissipated) as it moved. The speed seemed constant.  (The &#34;body/oval&#34; was about 1 inch at arms length and the &#34;tail&#34; as long as three inches.)  We watched it for about a minute till it moved off to the north.  It was low eneough that it seemed to be reflecting the lights from Columbia Mall. As it moved north and away from the lights the &#34;cloud&#34; no longer reflected the light, subsequently we lost sight of it. Planes were easily visible as were the stars and planets.<n>

I was able to see the light and beam for approximately 10-12 sec. and then it went out. Immediately after the light and beam went off I thought I saw what appeared to be 2 narrow rectangular dim red lights. The rectangular lights looked as though they closed up.

At first it appeared to be a firework or flare.  But as I continued to watch, the light did not descend.  Instead it began to move horizontally to the south.  At this point I grabbed my binoculars, and I could see that in addition to the brightest object there were two dimmer objects with fading orange tails which had apparently separated from the main object, and were decelerating, descending, and dimming.  I assume they were boosters of some sort.  I continued to watch the brightest object, which now had what appeared to be a very prominent shock wave originating in front of it.  After maybe 30 seconds, the shock wave suddenly got much bigger, then dissipated as the object continued southbound.  The object seemed to accelerate at this point.  I watched the object until it was obscured by a nearby mountain.  The object never changed color, and once it began moving horizontally never seemed to change direction, and from my perspective did not appear to be climbing or descending.  I would estimate that it was visible for two or three minutes.  By the color, I believe that the glow must have been from friction with the atmosphere.  While I would guess that the object was of Earthly origin since it appeared to have take off from somewhere in California, it certainly was not any type of conventional aircraft I have ever heard of.  There was simply no reference for me to be able to estimate distance, speed, or altitude, but it was about 25 degrees above the horizon.  I don&#39;t know from how far away a shock wave - if that&#39;s what it was - would be visible with 7 power binoculars, but perhaps that would help estimate a rough maximum distance.  I am assuming that whatever it was must have taken off from Vandenburg AFB. But if that was the case, and it stayed over the Pacific (which it mst have, or it would have been in Mex! ican airspace) it would have been at least 150 miles away from me.  This was also witnessed by my partner, who was in my vehicle at the time. My background:  I am currently a Border Patrol Agent, and was a Marine helicopter pilot from 1987 - 1997.<n>

We pulled over to observe the strange coincidence. The rectangular object became long and skinny with a white bottom and an orange top. When the object regained it&#39;s original shape the were two smaller objects floating down. It almost seemed as if the three objects had an aura around it. Then a few minutes later the main object then  retracted to a smaller shape and kind of came in and out of focus, eventually disappearing along with the two other objects.<n>

You were able to see it with the naked eye, as the moon went across the sky the point of light stayed in the same place from were we first saw it. I video tape the object, it did not move or changed in brightness I called my brother in-law who lives about 30 miles away and ask him to look up at the moon his first reaction was that it was a star, but I told him it has been in the same spot for about 20 min all-ready. I did not see when it went away or bliked out when I look up again about 8:55pm it was gone. If anyone could help me out on who I could show the video to that would be great. Thanks<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the light may have been one of the bright planets, which currently are very prominent in the western sky during the early evening.  We will look at the video.  PD))<n>

My friends were on their way up to play basket ball with me. I saw a fast moving object that looked like a star.  I watched it as it went into the western sky where the sun was.  I put my hands in front of my face to block the sun.  After about 20 seconds, three objects appeared and went back to the east side of the sky were the first object came from.  They were in a line like a row of a marching band.  The two on the sides moved very straight.  The one in the middle kept zig zagging from one to the other.  The two on the side kept moving east.  The one in the middle slowed down and started to circle above me.  It kept making wide circles above me.  The circular patterns became smaller and smaller until it stopped in the middle right above  me.  That is when I started talking to it and it started talking to me telepathically.  I have the message.  I need to talk to someone who can help us.  This is not a joke. I have told many people but none take me seriously.  I don`t know what else to do.

It seemed like it would be very big because the diameter of the light I saw was big!  It appeared and I turned to focus on it and right when I began to focus in on it very good, it dropped straight down at a very fast rate and dissappeared behind the hill!  No explosion surprisingly!

While I was coming home I saw a light in the sky, for awhile I thought it was a Helicopter beacause the way it was moving and how close to the ground it was. I thought it maybey it was a drug helicopter, but it wasen&#39;t. After awhile it vanshed behind some trees.And I forgot about.About 3 or 4 miles up pop back up and thats when I started to get scared because I was driving by a pasture about a 300 hundred acre of it and it was follwing me right on the side about 1 mile from me in the pasture, and then thats when I started to really get scared. And after awhile it disapered after I passed some trees. While I was close to my house there is a big hill you go on before you get to my house I saw three lights right on the edge of the hill barely and right when you have a full vision of my house there it was hovering right over my house I coulden&#39;t belive my eyes, What I was seeing, I was so in shocked then that I put my brakes on and just watched it there for about 3min There was a full moon out that night so you could see what it looked like anyway while I was sitting acar was coming up behind me a mile away so I started to drive in my drive way and thats when I started to beep my horn at my parents and sream out the window to tell them to come outside as fast as they can.After that the ufo started to leave very slowly and then about 5 seconds it took off real fast then it was gone, I never saw it again. From this day Iam a beliver of the unknown. I will never forget that night.<n>

The building was directly next to a state park at the end of a little peninsula separating the bay from the canal. It was dark on the balcony and dark outside.  It was approximately 11pm.  The two observers had been sitting for about 45 minutes watching the sky as they talked.  Suddenly one observer saw what she believed was a plane until she noticed that it was not.  The object was flying south toward the ocean gulf and was going slow enough and low for her to briefly glimpse a triangular flying object with no lights on it.  The only source of light was coming from the back end:  a tail of orange/red emissions that decreased in size as it left the back of the vehicle; Think golf tee.  Its emissions gave enough light to show the contours of the bottom side of the vehicle.  The bottom revealed a scalloped like design, much like the old corrugated roofs.  By the time the observer had registered this information and realized it could not be a plane (it was too close and did not look like one), it and its plume shot quickly away with no sound, then disappeared. The second observer saw a light out of the corner of his eye and turned in time to see a flash and then nothing.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

By the time the image of the triangle appeared in my eye it was gone.  The length of the trail was the length of ones hand if you held it at arms length against the sky.  My first impression of what I saw was that I was seeing the underbelly of a plane or something of that sort, but then when I processed the whole event I realized that it couldn&#39;t have been a plane that close to the land with that configuration and there wouldn&#39;t be a chance to have the underbelly lit like it was.<n>

The flat bottom was darker, but the top part was flickering white. &#34;Flickering&#34; probably isn&#39;t the best way to describe it.  The white parts almost seemed to be &#34;flowing&#34; about the top half.  It was not moving, just hovering slightly underneath the clouds.  My first reaction was NOT &#34;Wow, thats a UFO.&#34;  My first reaction WAS &#34;What the hell is that thing?&#34;  Once I ruled out airplane and helicopter, it occurred to me that it might be a UFO.  After watching it &#34;flicker&#34; for a minute or two, I drove behind a hill, blocking my view.  When I came around the hill, the object was gone.  I immediately began scanning the sky for it again, and I found what appeared to be the same object, only much farther away, and much closer to the horizon. Again, my view was blocked, and that was the last I saw of it.  I would just like to know if there were any other witnesses of this object, or if I am going loony.  Thanks.<n>

Then a ball shaped beam that completely detached from the craft dropped into a small forest in our southern fields then the craft left. After the crafts departure many smaller crafts were seen flying around with white and red flashing lights of the same shape as the larger one but much smaller small enough to number in the hundreds.

This area|7/5/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08182.html|71|ndxe199905| Iwas driving south from Nashville on Nolensville Rd at 9:30 p.m. Lights to my right (west) just off the road caught my eye.  This area on the southern Davidson/northern Williamson county line is rather rural.  My first thought was that two light planes were about to collide.  They were close and very low to the ground.  Suddenly I realized that what I was seeing was two boomerang crafts nested one behind the other only about two hundred feet off the ground.  They were perfectly still.  There was a small pinpoint light on the wing tip of each craft.  I was so astonished I stoppped the car and got out.  There was absolutely no sound and no movement.  The craft were black and metallic and the bottom appeared to have a ridge line.  I could see the sky between the two but they were probably no more than 20 to 25 feet apart.  At this point, I became extremely frightened and jumped in my car and sped away home.  Calls the next day to law enforcement offices, etc., turned up on other reports.  However, the airport authority was extremely interested and similar reports were received of a low flying, soundless object about an hour before mine approximately 50 miles north of this location. I had never heard of the boomerang or chevron craft before this time.<n>

Over the duration of the event one object moved off to the southwest and disappeared behind several trees. The remaining object was stationary for about 10 minutes when it began to slowly move up and down performing minute aerial acrobatics. This motion was observed for about 3 minutes when the object began to move in a circular motion for roughly 2 minutes. At this point the object changed colors several times (red, green, &amp; white) and then &#34;blinked out&#34;. Weather Conditions: Clear sky overhead.  Patches of clouds to the North and Northeast. Many other aircraft were observe in the distance in all directions. No chase took place. Height and distance were impossible to discern.<n>

The object started to pass &#34;behind&#34; the tree in our front yard and we both ran out front. Within 3 seconds we were out front clear of the tree but the object had completely disappeared?!No sign or trace, there were many aircraft, stars were CLEARLY visable and it was/is a VERY clear night. There was NO mistaking that this object was NOT a commercial or military aircraft of any type. The closest thing in shape and size would be a &#34;blimp&#34; but it was moving too fast and it completely disappeared, plus the fact that it had no clearance or blinking lights lights. The object was also totally w/o sound, my wife said she heard it but the sound I think she heard was a passing car...I think??<n>

We pulled off the road and watched it through binoculars for approx. 20 minutes.  It is difficult to say how far away it was from us but we could see it quite clearly with the binoculars.  It was approx. 1500 above the ground and it was hovering (horizontally).  It moved rotationally but not laterally. It was egg shaped, white, shiny, almost translucent.  It had no seams and no openings of any kind (no doors or windows). There were four sleek &#34;fins&#34; at one end, which could be legs if the egg were sitting on the ground (vertically).  We tried to rationalize what it could be and consequently did not take a picture.  (I did make a sketch of it but unfortunately threw it out after arriving home.)  As we drove away the &#34;egg&#34; rose slowly and moved south. We forgot about this experience until last week when I took my Grandson to a book store and he picked up a book on UFOs.  Pictured in this book was almost the exact &#34;object&#34; we observed.  It had been spotted in New Mexico in 1964 and the four &#34;fins&#34; (legs?) were straighter and jointed. The &#34;egg&#34; also had seams. It looked like an oldfashioned version of what we saw. I thought this was too much of a coincidence and decided that we should report it.

The lights were not attached to an object, they were 12-20 seperate units. We watched them fly at about the same height as the 8th deck we were on. The formation suddenly stopped and reversed it&#39;s direction. We at first thought that it might have been birds until it did that. The formation then flew towards the ship and then amazingly seperated into individual balls of light and then vanished. My girlfriend and I both work for a aircraft manufactuer and I am retired from the Airforce, we are both very familiar with flight patterns and what we saw was not normal for an aircraft.We just don&#39;t know what we saw but we did see something.<n>

I have been hesitant to talk about it, however having discovered this website I thought it is time now to do so. I am reporting this just as I wrote in my journal that night so it isn&#39;t as though I am relying on fuzzy memories.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was on the night of our wedding anniversary and my husband and I were driving home from my mother&#39;s house on the west side of the city. I was driving north on Canal St. then took a right(east) onto Brook St and proceeded to the intersection of Elm St. From there I went left (north) onto Elm and it was near the Bellman&#39;s Jewelers store that my husband first noticed what looked to be a very large jet. It was pretty low and appeared to be heading toward the direction of Manchester Airport. He lost sight of it momentarily as it seemed to disappear behind the New Hampshire Insurance building. It was so large and bright that he told me to watch as it would be flying right over our car. But as we were stopped at a red light at the intersection of Elm and the Amoskeag Bridge we both kept looking for the jet however it didn&#39;t appear. When the light changed I drove on slowly past the NH Insurance Building (it is on the corner of Elm &amp; the Amoskeag) looking for the jet that had seemingly disappeared. I was looking out of my side window as my husband watched from the front windshield. It was near a funeral home that I decided to pull over to the curb as a set of lights caught my eye - red and white, not blinking and distinctly shaped like a triangle. At first I thought that it was somehow attached to the roof of the building like a set of decorative lights. But I realized that the lights were not fixed, rather they were HOVERING. And it was very large. I got a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, like I had been kicked and lost my breath. I was overwhelmed with a sense of fear, wishing I wasn&#39;t there. I screamed at my husband &#34;It&#39;s hovering!&#34; He leaned over to look out the front windshield and the object began to slowly move toward the south. It was so close to us, just across the street. My husband then opened the car door and stepped out and look. I started to panic as I was afraid for him. The object made absolutely no sound and seemed to float effortlessly southeast over Elm St. heading toward the airport.! By this time I was so frightened I only wanted to leave. I shouted for my husband to get back in the car. When we got home we stayed up until 3 am talking about it and I had a restless sleep filled with nightmares.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The above description, as I stated before, was taken from my journal. To this day I am frightened when I recall that night.  My husband had always said he would have to see something for himself before he could believe yet he cannot explain what we experienced.  That it hovered soundlessly I cannot put out of my mind and I cannot come up with any sort of reasonable explanation. I hope I never see anything like that again.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

We note that 16MY99 fell on a Sunday, which supports the possibility, we feel, that the lights might have been part of weekend promotional activity.  PD))<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was leaving work about 12:30AM when I noticed in the sky an oval shapped lighted object in the sky. At first I thought it was a search light looking for planes. Then as I was driving around the horse shoe shapped road in the industrial park, I noticed that it was only about 100 feet in the sky and there are no airports or small planes that fly in the Central Islip area of long Island. As I started to get closer to the lighted object I noticed that it was moving lower to the street	and started following my car. I knew this was not a search light looking for planes now. Now I&#39;m driving as fast as I can, all the while this object is following me. When I got to the end of the street, the traffic light was Red, I stopped and waited for it to turn Green, as I looked up to my left was this oval shapped object now hovering to my left only about 100 feet in the sky, it was as if it was waiting for me at the intersection. All of a sudden this oval shapped lighted object splits up into 4 smaller oval shapped lighted objects, and they start rotating around each other, all the time staying the same distance apart from one another. Now the traffic light turns green and I take off driving as fast as I can. I&#39;m heading North on Carlton Ave. to get to the LIE. I look over to my left and the 4 lighted objects are following me on the left side of the road, only about 100 feet in the sky. Then I saw head lights in my rear view mirror, I tried to get the attention of the car behind me, the driver just passed me up, I looked over and noticed the 4 lighted objects were gone now. I keept driving North on Carlton Ave. and now I was the only car on the road again, I look over to my left and once again I see the 4 oval shapped lighted objects on the left side of the road, about 100 feet in the sky and moving alone with my car. Now I&#39;m really getting scarred, I don&#39;t know what the hell this thing is. Then once again another car approaches from behind me, I look over to my left and the 4 lighted objects are gone again. I&#39;m st! ill driv ing North on Carlton Ave. and I don&#39;t see the objects anymore, since the second car passed by me. Then instead of going straight home I decide to turn down one of the residential streets in Central Islip. As I was slowly driving down this dark narrow street something strange came over me, and I asked myself why did I turn down this residential street instead of going straight home? I then decided to get back onto Carlton Ave. and go home. But instead of just turning the car around, I decided to continue down this street and make a right and then another right to get back to Carlton Ave. I finally get to the end of the residential street and I see a lighted object in the sky, directly in front of me, this time only about 50 feet in the sky, I froze for a minute as I watched this object hovering in the sky. Then all of a sudden the 1 object splits off into 4 objects, just like it did earlier. Now there were 4 smaller oval shapped lighted objects hovering in the sky, and rotating around each other right in front of me. I step on the gas pedal and make the right turn, I&#39;m driving as fast as I can, I get to the next corner and make another right turn to get back to Carlton Ave. I&#39;m driving as fast as I  can and looking back every other second, the objects were still following me. I finally get to the end of the street, I make a left onto Carlton Ave. I&#39;m heading north and driving as fast as I can, I don&#39;t see the lighted objects anymore. I finally get to the LIE and all the way home I don&#39;t see the lighted objects. I don&#39;t know what it was that I saw, but it was diffenitly not a search light of any kind, it was diffentitly following me. And I never saw anyhing like that again.<n>

Object appeared as a stationary bright strobing light alternating/flashing white/blue/red. Object observed for approx 20 min. Object did not move throughout observation. Sky conditions were clear. Stars in field of view did not exhibit similiar strobing, and lights appeared brighter than usual ICAO marker lights of aircraft. Oject size appeared to be slightly larger than the surrounding star field and distant. 1 witness of this event; observer thought object was curious but attributed it to atmospheric phenonema or plane. As observer returned to inside of residence for the evening approx. 2125L object was still visible above tree/horizon line. Observer not mention sighting until Sunday May 16, 1999. (2) second/additional sighting at 2315L in NNW sky approximately 15 deg. above horizon from same observation point, a residence in Perry Township. Object was a stationary bright strobing light rapidly flashing white/red/blue. Object remained staionary throughout observation. Sky conditions were clear, and stars in visible field of view did not exhibit similiar strobing effect. Object was much brighter than nearby stars in field of view.  Strobing was brighter/faster than usual ICAO marker lights. 2 Witnesses to this event. Object was observed for app. 30 minutes and remained stationary for entire period. During this observation object was observed through  8 X 40 power binoculars, and the strobing appeared to be a circular, primarily bright white with the blue and red flashes in rotation around the white light. The white light was almost glaring and the object appeared to have a clearly defined/sharp profile, like the light from a lazer pen rather than a flashlight, for example. Observers thought light was curious but attributed to perhaps a blimp or atmospheric phenomena. Observers viewed object until 2345 then returned to residence. One of these observers returned to check again at 0100 and light was gone. There is a regional airfield to the NE of the observation point approx. 5 miles away, and this airfield hosts reserve helicopters. But the object light(s) were unmoving and appeared distant in both the 2105L and 2315L observations, and no rotor blade noise was heard. In fact, no sound was heard at all during either sighting. All observers are long-time residants of area and familiar with air traffic patterns around and over house. Observer of 2105L sighting professional with BS degree currently completing Masters, observers of 2315L sighting (1) degreed ex Air Force Intelligence veteran (2) college bound HS student. Observers discovered mutual sighting event during conversation on morning of May 16th. Observers are familiar with pattern of star motion over residence, and considered if the two sighting were of the same object it was unlikely to be a star or plant, as the object would have had to move south to north. If the observations were of different objects the observers found it curious that other stars/planets in field of view did not exhibit similar strobing effect. And if object was an aircraft then itwas stationary/hovered, and the ICAO markers were about twice the magnitude of those normally observed from passing aircraft. We have had blimps in past years, but the observed strobing was dissimilar to the advertising lights normally seen from them in the past. Of particular curiousity was the fact the the object was completely stationary during observations, and did not exhibit movement as the star field moved. Observers are curious as to what they may have observed; skeptical about supernatural explanation but thought sighting worthwhile for investigation. Will speak with an investigator but have no interest or desire to have observers names/occupations/etc publicized in any way.<n>

I went outside to look and within a few minutes saw a light move from points east to points south, almost the entire field of view. It then made a sudden 45 degree turn and cut straight across the sky, passing directly overhead and continuing until it was out of my field of view. It appeared to be very high in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a steady, white light,moved without making a sound. It was a very clear night. I thought perhaps it was a plane, shooting star, or even a satelite, but was convinced otherwise when it made its sharp 45 degree turn with no reduction in speed. Speaking of speed, it remained constant the whole time, taking about 45 seconds to go from my far left to my far right, then about another minute after it made its turn. I am 31 yrs old, married with kids, and studying to be an accountant.<n>

The 2 objects were identical, approx.2 times the size of the moon  It is not easy to estimate the altitude, but it must be at the cloud level, because their size was constant.

Craft seemed to self-illuminate. Daylight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting outside my studio in the sun reading a magazine. After a while I put it aside and leaned back looking at the blue sky with some great clouds moving around in no particular direction. I wore Vuarnet Skilynx sunglasses which has a deep yellow filter that enhances the sky beautifully. Half an hour later I discovered two dark objects floating upwards on the distant sky to the north. I brought out my binoculars (Bushnell 10x50 wide angle, 341 ft at 1000 yrds) and could see two sets of three black dots that seemed to &#34;dance&#34; upwards on the sky. Figured in the end that these must have been some kind of balloons. As I was following these objects with my binoculars there was suddenly something that streaked across my field of vision. Something bright. I quickly followed the &#34;thing&#34; with my binoculars and managed to keep my eye on it for 7-8 seconds. It looked like some sort of silver colored self-illuminated craft that was shaped like a wedge, and it had darker flowing lines running along the ... fuselage. Front to back. The front end was pointed and the rear was somewhat rounded. It looked like a formstudy from design school. Furthermore it had no visible wings. Nor did it give any exhaust. There was no sound from the craft. The color was silvery and shiny - even with the sun behind it. It lacked normal shadows. The speed I can only estimate to Mach 3-4. Maybe somewhat faster. It flew in a straight line from north to south. Its altitude was around 10.000 to 15.000 feet. It eventually went behind some clouds, but did not come out on the other side. My location was 1/2 mile north of Atlanta Waterworks on Antone Street, and the event took place west of me. I have also submitted a recreation of the event in a photo-digital format to the UFO Reporting Center.<n>

As I started to cross a wide tressle across the river I happened to look up and was suprised to see a grey/silver cylinder dead ahead at 60 degrees against the clear blue sky. The object appeared small. Its length was about 1/2 my thumb nail&#39;s width at arms length and it was about 1/2 as wide as it was long. It looked metallic but I could not discern any other distinguishing features. The sky was completely cloudless and I could see no other air traffic in the vicinity. I took about 5 careful steps while watching this stationary object which just seemed to dangle in the sky. As I was crossing a railroad tressle I was soon forced to look down to confirm my footing, and when I looked up the object was gone. I stood still looking for the object for at least a minute but saw no sign of it from horizon to horizon. As I was crossing the very wide Susquehanna there were no trees to occlude my view. The object had completely dissappeared. I am not a novice to outdoor phenomena, I hike as often as possible and watch the skys everywhere I go. My vision is better than 20/20 (uncorrected) and I am a highly sceptical individual. I am an emergency room physician by trade and in addition to my MD I also hold a PhD in pharmacology. I did not initially report this sighting as I felt very confident that I would be able to find a &#39;down to earth&#39; explaination very soon. However time has passed and 1 and 1/2 years later I am still as puzzled as ever. Has anyone else experienced similar phenomena?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

When I stand on my back deck and look southwest, you&#39;ll see a light that&#39;s brighter than any other star.  At first I thought it was a star, but it moved vertically and horizontally.  Sometimes it changes colors.  About 2 weeks ago it was flashing red, green, and white.  This light is out there almost every night.  It&#39;s pretty weird.  My wife, father-in-law, and 2 neighbors have witnessed it. It&#39;s been there almost every night since I first saw it starting about 1 year ago when I stated to put on my pool deck. I am in the flight path of Atlanta Hartsfield Airport.  But it definitely not a plane or copter.  It just looks light a bright star that moves and changes colors.<n>

It was about 9:18 AM, May 14 (Friday).   We had just passed over Lake Mead; I had the left window seat.  I saw Bullhead City, where I often vacationed.  I did not see Las Vegas, so it must have been on the right of our plane. We were probably travelling almost directly along the California/Nevada border.  Judging from my atlas, the aircraft I saw was probably in the vicinity of Death Valley (valley), in California, somewhere in an area bounded by Cima, Shoshone, Ballarat and Barstow. We had just passed directly over another commercial jetliner, much below our altitude.  I looked up to see a black, jagged, roughly-rectangular aircraft slowly rise to our same altitude, going very slow, counter to our direction, gradually stopping relative movement and seeming to stay even with our flight. It appeared about half the size of the other aircraft (737&#39;s) we passed, which all shone brightly light in the clear sun.  This craft made a densely-black silhouette; no wings or fins were apparent.  It did not diminish in size as it would have if it were travelling away from us. It was west of us, at roughly ten o&#39;clock out the window. I watched it for a few minutes. I looked away for approximately 1 to 2 seconds, and looked back.  It had totally disappeared from the cloudless sky. I have been a bird watcher for years, so know how to scan for flying things. We were at full altitude, above the haze line.  I estimate it was 2 to 10 miles from us.  I did not know about Area 51 until after the flight, when I spoke with the pilot.  He said we were in that area at the time I described, and that many unusual sightings had been reported there. However, he did not acknowledge seeing any aircraft at our altitude (which surely must have come to their attention).<n>

But there was no wing span visible and the lights were steady ,not flashing like you would see on a plane.<n>

Again there was a light, this time accompanied by two more lights in a triangular formation.  i called my fiance over and the lights vanished.  About five minutes later my fiance saw a light outside followed by a bright flash of light like cloud to cloud lightening. Taking my dog outside again around 11 pm the lights were still around.  This time it was a red light hovering above the interstate.  This interstate runs to Nasville so runs from west to east.  This light turned a blue colour and rapidly moved back in my direction.  I believe that that would be a southerly direction.  This blue light hovered above a field across the street from my apartmernt complex.  My dog for some reason then raised the hair on his back, put his tail between his legs as if in a defensive posture.  He then turned and made for the apartment. Over about the next hour my dog remained on the balcony staring at the sky.  The lights flickered on and off for a second at one point but i cannot confirm if the two are related. 12:30 my fiance took the dog out for the last time before bed.  She saw what she describes as three headlights, bright cigar shaped lights, hovering almost directly over the apartment building.  The lights were bright. It is there that this light remained for the duration of her time outside, about five minutes. None of these lights made any noise whatsoever.  The movemnents of the lights were precise and accurate almost like they were flying looking for or at something.  the movements were so exact that my fiance, who is a skeptic of ufo&#39;s, could not identify the lights as either a plane nor a helicopter.  I, not being a skeptic, understand the meaning of &#34;ufo&#34; cannot identify the craft under my knowledge as being a helicopter or a aeroplane.  The movemnts were too exact and noiseless.<n>

But this was very unsal.    I also have a vido tape from 1987 of a ufo in this area if you are interested. I relize its from 12 years ago but its very interesting.

At first I thouhgt it was a Jet falling to the Earth or maybe a Missle. It took me by surprise! My best guess is is that it was probably a Meteor. I would approximate the distance at 15 mi. N.W. of Neenah, heading N.W.It was very bright(like a 4th of July sparkler)which I thought was odd considering the Sun was still high in the sky. I would say it was about half B.B. size held at arms length. It left a vapor trail that wasn&#39;t very long but it was as wide as an existing vapor trail from a Jet. I thought... &#34;something is definately going to strike the Earth.&#34;<n>

At first I thought it was a star, but it was 19:00 hrs, with the sun well above the horizon.  It was too early to be seeing stars.  So I got a pair of field glasses and got a better look.  It was a bright circle with something dark brown or red on one side of the circle.  During the course of my observations I saw several commercial aircrafts travel at appox. 30-40,000 ft,  It appeared that this object was well above this altitude.  I was able to observe the object for approx. 1 hr.  Both my parents also witnessed the object.  It could have been a weather balloon,  I&#39;ve  never seen one before.  But my guess is you wouldn&#39;t be able to observe one for that long.  Nor would it be as large as I would think this object must have been.  My guess is 2-3 times larger than a airliner.  Eventually I saw it disappear like a light going out.  During the course of the 1hr. the object did travel some distance across the sky, no more that 3 fists from an extended arm. Personal biography: This is the first sighting I&#39;ve ever seen.  I would not dismiss the Idea that it was a weather balloon ascending out of sight.  My education is BSBA, MBA, I am a financial analyst for a national law firm, my father is a retired M.D. and my mother is a homemaker.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC:  Venus may be visible in the western sky at this hour, but we do not have any explanation for why it would have suddenly disappeared from sight.))<n>

The object was white and was of a spherical shape. The outline of the object was distinct; there was no evidence of ionization around it, and no vapor trail or tail followed it. The object followed a straight path in the lower sky, approximately SW to NE.  Without slowing down it traveled into a small puffy cloud and did not emerge from the other side of the cloud. No other aircraft were present in the sky at that time, and the object made no sound audible at ground level. There were only a few other clouds in the northern sky at that time, and blue sky was visible all around that cloud.  The wind at that time was prevailing west at 10-15 mph. I observed the cloud into which the object had &#34;disappeared&#34; until the wind carried the cloud out of my field of view. I am a male, age 44, in good health, with 20-20 vision.

I estimate the size between 150-250 feet across.  There was no sound and the craft accelerated away at a rapid speed (no sound either!).  I&#39;m a skeptic but this really scared me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had just finished work and decided to drive out to the local Air National Guard base here in Terre Haute.  It was about 1:15 am.  Sometimes, the guard runs night practice and when I can&#39;t sleep I will go watch the planes take off and land.  There were no planes this night, but I parked on a small country road not too far from the runway.  I got out of my car and looked up to see if I could see anything circling the airport.  It was silent and I almost fell to the ground because a large triangular craft was approaching from behind me (to the east).  It was completely silent and about 150-250 feet across with blue, red and white lights that appeared to go all the way around the craft.  I estimate the elevation was no more than 1000-1500 feet from the ground.  It was simply hovering and within about 10-15 seconds, it left toward the western sky at a tremendous speed (faster than the fighter jets I am used to watching).  What was strangest is that the craft made NO sound.  I am a skeptic and quite frankly I do not believe in UFO&#39;s, but having no idea what this craft is, I would have to call it a UFO.  I am a Ph.D. scientist here at a local university (I do NOT want my name divulged as I am sure to be ridiculed).  I simply cannot imagine the technology behind this craft. I am reporting this to you for your information and do not wish to have my privacy invaded.  This is a small town and the University is not that big either so I hope you can understand my wish for anonymity.<n>

It moved southwest, stopped, and moved northeast on a parallel path.  Then it disappeared behind a tree and appeared again to the south of the original locale. Then it disappeared totally in the clouds.  I only saw one and it was orange in color, but that could have been the clouds altering the light. Shortly after I witnessed this, I did see a commercial aircraft headed north, I imagine it was bound for the Indianapolis airport. I am an employee in the local mall and am 21 years of age.

This helicopter had placed itself over some treetops near the intersection where I turn to get onto my block. As I neared it, I noticed it seemed to not be a helicopter at all, as it had three lights equally spaced around a less brightly lit center with a small row of red lights flashing one after the other from outside to the inside of the bottom surface. As I turned to go to my house, it slid silently over my truck(which freaked me badly, because by this time the realization was just setting in that this was no helicopter). I nearly missed my turn into my driveway, had to reverse, to turn in (a three point turn gone horribly wrong), and as I got out and looked up, I found that it had vanished.<n>

It did not have a trail and it was so high it did not make a sound. At first I thought it might be nothing, but then it started to move faster. It increased in speed then vanished. Just faded. That was it.<n>

I was  proceeding approximately due  south  from Terrill Mill Rd. into the North x  Northwest Office Park when I saw what I believed at first to be a meteor.  The object was moving from  northwest  to southeast (approximate bearing 150  degrees), had no tail (unlike a meteor),  had a clearly defined edge, was  visible for about 1 to 2 seconds and  then disappeared  from a relatively clear sky (particularly clear in  the direction of the object (light ball).  The phrase  &#34;winked out&#34; describes the way it disappeared.  There was no  noise  as it passed by and no apparent explosion when it went out.  The diameter of the ball  was approximately 1/5 to 1/10 the size of a full moon with a circular shape.  The elevation and speed of a light that  are nearly impossible to estimate at night  against a dark sky. I frequently tape the Art Bell show and Friday (May 14, 1999) listened to a segment  taped earlier that  morning which  included a    description by a woman on the Leaky Leaky Highway in Hawaii.  Aside from the size and proximity her description  was close to what I saw.<n>

Therefore, I see lots of flying objects in the sky, and if it&#39;s night I always look up at the planes.  Well, on Monday, May 10, 1999,  around 9:15 pm, I had just dropped off a letter into the postbox and was on my way to the supermarket, when something right above me caught my eye.  At first when I looked at this object I thought &#34;what a strange plane&#34; it was.  It took me about a second to realize that this was no airplane--at least like none that I have seen. It seemed to be triangular in shaped (not equilateral), with golden yellow lights at what would probably be the points, and moving very fast from the southwest to the northeast.  The forward part of the object was not actually a point, but rather more to the left of a point--so I guess if you were to look at a triangle that was turned about 5-8 degrees to the right--the reulting top of it would be the front part of the object (I hope this makes sense).  It made absolutely no noise.  It was VERY large--though without a frame of reference I can&#39;t say exactly how large.  Living in a metro area, I only see (on a really clear night) the major stars and planets, so, I couldn&#39;t tell if any stars were blocked by the object. The most peculiar thing about this object was that I felt like I was viewing it through water.  The image shimmered like a mirage, or something like the transporter scenes from Star Trek when the people are midway in the transport process.  The lights did not seem to be singular but rather arrays at each point; but this impression could be due to the shimmering effect.  The viewing lasted about 5 seconds, at which time the damned thing simply blinked out. The night was crystal clear, not a single cloud in the sky so this was not a case of something being reflected off clouds.  A couple of seconds after the object blinked out a commercial airplane came in (from west to east) for a landing at LaGuardia.   I got the impression that this object was up very high, certainly lots higher than the incoming plane.  Unfortunately, there were no other people near me at the time--well there might have been , but I simply couldn&#39;t take my eyes off this thing and it all happened so quickly--it would have been gone before I could get someone&#39;s attention.<n>

As we exited my front porch in my rural town we saw a beam of light coming over the top of the hill I live on, near the road.  We just assumed it was a car but heard nothing.  The light shifted and rose over the trees.  I did not see where this light was coming from.  We both stared at this beam of light that rose from the tree tops over our heads.  I said to my girlfriend &#34;It looks like someone has a really bright flash light or spot light and is in the trees shining it!!&#34;  As rediculous as it sounds that is exactley what it looked like! I could not figure where this light was coming from.  The light lifted up in the air way above the tree tops and the beam of light shortened towards us and turned in a rotating motion over our heads.  It looked like a bunch of little rays of light rotating over our heads.  I grabbed my girlfriend and said for her to move out from under it.  I ran inside and told my father to come outside and see.  When he got outside it was gone but there was this bright, glow-like cluster of clouds in the sky.  Now I don&#39;t know if what we saw was nature or UFO.  What ever it was freaked us out even to this day.  If anyone has any sort of info or shared experience(s) please e-mail me.  Thank you. ----- ((name and e-address deleted))<n>

Could not be an aircraft banking or a mylar type balloon due to shape and size viz. 1/3 to 1/2 the size of the MD11.  Also, UFO did not behave as a balloon or kite i.e flapping, waving or oscillaing in wind.  UFO flew straight, level trajectory at approx. 1,000ft. and disappeared above a tree line to the north east.  As UFO passed by and the angle changed, I could see that it was definitely spherical but disk-shaped.  Also, the brilliance of the reflection did not change as the angle to sight changed.  UFO was silent and demonstrated no evudence of propulsion, but demonstrated controled flight &amp; trajectory.<n>

The moment we had started to get into his car I noticed something blocking out the stars to the Northwest at about 500 feet. The triangle had a plasma like glow at each of its corner kinda bronze in color. Along its sides it had what appeared to be either running lights or small ports that were lit. It slowly moved to the East without making any noise almost like it was a boat drifting on water. We hurriedly got into the car and drove to my house and talked a while about what we had seen. I&#39;ve yet to see one again but I cannot forget it!<n>

In the morning when I get up I notice a small puncture wound on my forehead with a small almount of blood around it. This has happened on numerous occassions for the past 14 or 15 years. The last time was on May 10, 1999. A small scratch was on my right temple and about an inch above and to the front of it was a small puncture wound. The next morning a small &#34;pocket&#34; of blood had formed in my right eye and eventually spread around the whole eye giving me one heck of a black eye.  If anyone has had similar experiences I would appreciate hearing about it.<n>

This helicopter had placed itself over some treetops near the intersection where I turn to get onto my block. As I neared it, I noticed it seemed to not be a helicopter at all, as it had three lights equally spaced around a less brightly lit center with a small row of red lights flashing one after the other from outside to the inside of the bottom surface. As I turned to go to my house, it slid silently over my truck(which freaked me badly, because by this time the realization was just setting in that this was no helicopter). I nearly missed my turn into my driveway, had to reverse, to turn in (a three point turn gone horribly wrong), and as I got out and looked up, I found that it had vanished. I checked the car&#39;s clock just after the event, and am happy to report no missing time or other wierd phenomena. Also there was a(definite)helicopter in the vicinity just prior to the time of the event, which was landing at a nearby rock quarry- I thought nothing of this at the time, having seen a helicopter there before in daylight, but in retrospect, it seems odd at 11:40 at night-not exactly normal business hours.<n>

It was moving slowly and heading S.E. towards City of Snohomish.  The object was engulfed in this intense red light which was at an altitude of approximetely 500 feet and 20 feet in diameter.  Even as it was overhead my husband and I were still unable to hear any sound.  We tried looking through a pair of binoculars, but all I was able to see was the bright red light. Once it was beyond our house and over Ebbey Island it started to gain altitude and disappeared into the clouds.  I watched until I couldn&#39;t see the glowing red light from behind the clouds any longer.<n>

I was on my way to the local stripmall to get an early lunch.  Being into UFOlogy myself, I tend to watch the sky...this was my first sighting. This was last Saturday...and I glanced up at the western sky, and I observed an object traveling towards me (east) at about 8000 feet.  The object was moving at a rapid pace, much like a jet. I assumed, at first, that it was a jet..but I noticed that I could observe no &#34;hard&#34; outline...it did not look like a jet.  It had my attention. The object was on a straight track with my position...and as it continued towards my position, at the very moment the object was directly over me...its STOPPED...and it did not travel in any direction for 20 minutes. Well, needless to say, when the object stopped over me...a VERY sudden deceleration..it definatly had my attention. There was no noise from this object. I could not make out the shape of the object for sure, but it was obviously metallic due to the reflection.  Suddenly the object appeared to change it&#39;s shape slightly..almost like it &#34;split in two&#34;....and the object started to ROTATE Counter-Clockwise!! I continued to watch this object, directly overhead, for a full 7 minutes...and quite frankly Peter, I got bored and went to get my lunch..I was inside for about 5 minutes and when I came out, the object was still there...only now it appeard to have split into 4 &#34;lobes&#34;...still rotating. So I continued to watch it...and after about 5 minutes the object did the most astounding thing.  It suddenly moved in a rapid &#34;figure 8&#34; pattern, but did NOT travel in any direction, per se...it was still quite stationary, other than this manuver and it&#39;s rotation. It was at that point that I knew this had to be a real &#34;hypertechnology vehicle&#34; (ufo) and it was also at this point that I tried to get the attention of the people around me, to look at this. NOW THIS IS THE ODDEST PART OF ALL....I COULD NOT GET ANYONE TO LOOK AT THIS OBJECT!  THIS WAS A CROWDED STRIPMALL, AND YET I COULD NOT GET ANYONE TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS EVEN THERE!  NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON EVEN GLANCED IN MY DIRECTION, IT WAS JUST LIKE I WAS NOT EVEN THERE.  THEY HAD TO HEAR ME, I WAS SOMEWHAT FRANTIC, TRYING TO GET THEM TO LOOK AT THIS OBJECT, BUT I SWEAR PETER...IT WAS LIKE I WAS NOT THERE, AND THEY DID NOT REACT AT ALL TO MY WORDS. This really started to bother me...and the object continued to rotate, in place. I stood there for several more minutes. Well, at this point I went back to my office to call a friend of mine who lives a few miles down the road, to see if he could see this object..but he could not. I went back outside to see if it was still there, but it was gone, nowhere to be seen. I did not have a camera at the time...much to my disgrace. I hearby swear that the above events are true and accurate, and I KNOW this was not an ordinary object...it was not a bunch of balloons, such things could not travel that fast and suddenly stop and hover in place..for 20 minutes, it&#39;s impossible. But I have to say peter...the fact that I could not get ANYONES attention really scared me, and I wondered if there was some sort of &#34;mind control&#34; taking place here. --END.<n>

I had &#34;One of those feelings&#34; and was hoping to see something. I got my binoculars just in case. At exactly midnight, I spotted a very slow moving starlike object moving beside the planet in the sky, probably Venus. It was not blinking, too slow for a shooting star, wasn&#39;t traveling in a elliptical path, so it was unidentifiable. It moved down the sky for about 20 seconds before fading out of view. It was white in color. At 12:14, I see another starlike object in the sky, this one is more blue with the same characteristics as the last object. It moved at a 5 degree slope in the sky upward very slowly (slightly west) for about 1 and 1/2 minutes before stopping, and headed straight east at a 90 degree from its last position before moving out of view behind the clouds. 22 minutes later, it was back again for about 20 seconds and headed straight up before fading out of view again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would have had witnesses, had my step-dad not been called to work 15 minutes before. My mom had also just laid back down to go back to sleep, and I had just got off of the phone with my girlfriend. If my mom wasn&#39;t permanentely disabled I would have got her up to see em&#39;, but I didn&#39;t want to wake her. I would have had physical evidence if a regular 35mm camera could take good pictures of the night sky, but I couldn&#39;t even see the planet that was out in the view lenses. So I decided since this is the second sighting I&#39;ve had this year alone (last was on March 3, I think I reported it to you) I am going to buy a video camera as to prove that I am not having hallucinations nor am I crazy. Also, this was the second time this year I asked my Father and Creator Yahweh for a sign from the sky and I got one. There is indeed a spiritual connection there.....<n>

He was puzzled by the number of contrails, some in X-shapes, and aimed the camera sequentially moving around the sky. He did not realize until he went to his computer to download the digital images that he had captured unidentified aerial craft in one frame identified as Dcp00102, shown below. The frame Dcp00101 which preceded it by only a couple of seconds is also shown below. Not only are the objects unidentified, but there is another mystery: why aren&#39;t the objects visible in frame Dcp00101? Here is the man, a Phoenix salesman, describing his first hand experience that morning: Phoenix, Arizona: &#34;I&#39;ve been kind of interested in the contrails and been taking pictures of them for the last several months. And so, I looked up into the sky and the sky was just full of contrails that morning, including an X which - I&#39;ve seen a lot of contrails up there, but not an X every single time. So, I was taking pictures starting from the north and then turning clockwise and I probably took about six to eight pictures and wound up kind of facing to the south, southwest, with my last picture. And about an hour later, I went to the computer and downloaded them into the computer and I was looking at them to see if there was anything I would like to put on my web page. I&#39;ve put most of the of the contrails I&#39;ve taken on my web page. As I went through them starting with the first picture heading towards the last picture, they were pretty much typical with the contrail in there and what I had expected to be seeing. And then I got to the last picture, or next to last (turns out it was last), and I saw something in that picture and it was definitely unexpected. WHAT DID YOU SEE? When I first looked at this, it looked almost like a round, metallic ball in the sky. I kind of focused in over the roof of my next door neighbor&#39;s house and just outside one of the clouds up there and fairly close to one of the contrails, there was this round, metallic, ball-looking thing. And then right next to that, fairly close to it, there was a dark spot on the film. And as I zoomed in on it, I could still see what appeared to be kind of a round metallic object up there, but then the two dark spots - or actually, the dark spot - looked like TWO dark spots. It looked to me as if it could be a couple of military jets. They were dark in color whatever they were. They were kind of in the shape of an aircraft. AND IN YOUR PHOTO WHICH I&#39;M LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE QUITE CLOSE. AND WHAT PUZZLES ME - YOU WERE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS WITH THIS NEW CAMERA, SO YOU WERE CONCENTRATING ON THE NEW CAMERA. BUT DID YOU NOT HEAR THE SOUND OF JETS? No. no. One other thing I was going to mention - there was another photo I took, I think it was the one just before this that has that same cloud in it. It&#39;s just slightly moved from that location. But, in that picture there was nothing other than that same cloud. You could see the form of it. You can tell it&#39;s the same cloud. AND WHAT TIME PERIOD DO YOU THINK IS BETWEEN THE TWO PHOTOS? Oh, it was just a couple of seconds. About the time it takes for the camera to regenerate to the next shot. I THINK THAT&#39;S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO SHOW THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE SECOND PHOTOGRAPH DID NOT SEEM TO BE IN THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPH TWO SECONDS BEFORE. Right. AND THAT WOULD MAKE BOTH OBJECTS, THE BLACK AND THE ROUND OBJECT, ANOMALOUS. Yes. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING ANOMALOUS IN THE SKIES BEFORE THIS PHOTOGRAPH ON MAY 7TH OF THESE UNUSUAL OBJECTS IN THE CONTRAILS? PHOENIX LIGHTS, March 13, 1997: Well, yes, as a matter of fact on March 13, 1997, when what came through here they are now calling the &#34;Phoenix Lights.&#34; I was a witness to that also. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. OK. I was going to a friend&#39;s house. It was just a little after dark, probably somewhere between 8 and 8:30 in the evening. So, it was fairly dark out at that time of year. And I pulled up in front of his house and was just turning the car off, just about to get out and I looked out my driver&#39;s side window and I saw four lights in the sky. Maybe about 3,000 to 4,000 feet up in the air. And they were just huge, bright lights. They appeared to be maybe a couple of miles from where I was. But what was unusual about it was that they were in the shape of a diamond - like with one light at the top and one at each side and one at the bottom. So, I kept looking trying to figure out, &#39;What is this?&#39; Because I had never seen anything like this before. And I noticed they were coming straight down out of the sky. They were all coming down at the same time, so it wasn&#39;t like they were individual objects. They appeared to be all moving at the same rate of speed which was actually fairly slow. LIKE FOUR LIGHTS ON SOME SORT OF A LARGE OBJECT THAT WAS THE SHAPE OF A DIAMOND? Right. OR AT LEAST THE LIGHTS WERE IN THE CONFIGURATION OF A DIAMOND ON A LARGE OBJECT? Right. More like that actually. And so I was trying to figure out in my mind, &#39;What is this?&#39; and what came to mind was that it might be a commercial jetliner in a nose dive headed toward the ground. But then I thought that can&#39;t be because it was moving too slow. And I just didn&#39;t know what it was. And as it continued down, I kept thinking I was going to see this gigantic ball of flames burst up when it hits the ground. Then it just kind of disappeared behind the house across the street from where I was. Then I couldn&#39;t see it any longer. Then this turned out to be the Phoenix Lights. As the story goes, they came from outside of Phoenix from the north headed down through Phoenix and kind of turned and headed out towards the Tucson area. And there&#39;s just been people all over the city and state who have seen these. And evidently, that&#39;s what I saw.&#34;<n>

It was far off in the distance, but it was hard to tell how far it was compared to how big it was. In my best estimation i would say it was about 5 to 10 thousand feet up. It was glowing faintly, at first i thought it was an after image from staring at a bright light but my 3 freinds saw it also. The object was perceived to be moing very slowly, but withouth knowing its size or distance its imposible to know exactly. It turned from its downward direction and started looping around in a random swirling pattern before slowly spreading out to 10 times its original size and fading away as it did so. My freinds and i all agreed that it did not look like fire works, a meteorite, an airplane, a baloon or a search light. The witneses that i know of.. although im sure there were more. are all college students, from long island NY.<n>
5/6/99 23:50|Little Rock|AR|Triangle|10 minutes|A small triangle craft flew over me and then flew off into a field and looked like it landed in this field.|5/24/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/007/S07688.html|148|ndxe199905| A small triangle craft flew over me and then flew off into a field and looked like it landed in this field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got off work at about 11:30 PM Central time and was driving down the interstate. I live in Arkansas and traffic at the time of night is virtually non-existent. I happened to glance up at the horizon and saw 3 lights. I thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me because it looked like the object was hovering over the interstate. I sped up from about 65 mph to 75 mph and realized that indeed the object was hovering, well not exactly hovering because it kept up with me. I got to the point that it was directly overhead of me, about lined up with the tree line. Then it sped up and curved off into a field and begin to sink lower and lower until it was concealed by the trees. The object was in the shape of a triangel with lights at all three points. At the tip of the triangle there was a red light and then 2 white lights on both sides of the base. I was able to see its shape once it had moved on to the field and it was flat. A flat triangular object. This shocked me. I reported it to the sheriffs office and I probably should have reported it to the air traffic controller but didn&#39;t think about it until later. I also saw several other triangular looking objects in the sky but I wasn&#39;t sure if these were the same type of craft because they were furthur in the distant and looked to be a lot bigger than the first. The first was very small and very, very close to the ground. The others were higher up and looked to be much larger but the same shape. Thanks<n>

Interestingly enough, I had a &#34;feeling&#34; about it before it happened. The incident occurred while we were driving home from a shopping foray into Pueblo, CO. A little after sunset I spotted another yellow-orange light, this time in the Western sky, though not as bright as the prior UFO. It was stationary and I thought it might be a star but then it split into TWO lights right next to each other, then merged back into one, then two--the strangest thing. After a couple of minutes of shape-shifting, it started fading in and out. It would disappear for 30-40 seconds, then appear again. This occurred MULTIPLE times and there were ZERO clouds in the sky that could have caused the light to be periodically obscured. Also it was not a mechanical strobing like airplane lights but more random and the source wasn&#39;t moving much. Finally, after another 3-4 minutes, it just faded out for good. My wife saw it too, although she couldn&#39;t get as sustained a look because she was driving when it occurred.<n>

I was observing a Tennesse Air National Guard C-141 transport. It was westbound, and then started to turn right (North). From behind the C-141, but very distant appearing, I saw a very small, but bright point of light. It would remind one of Venus, in the early evening, well before dark. It was hard to maintain visual contact while driving, so I pulled off the road to try to re-acquire it, but had no luck. No motion was observed, no other lights etc... The sky was crystal clear, no clouds at all. No other observers. We are so close to Arkansas, just across the Mississippi River, that the object had to be over Arkansas. My impression was of a large object, very high and very far away. It wasn&#39;t Venus, Mars, Jupiter or Vega, which is very bright. It was too far North to be any of those. The general direction was approximately 290 degrees true. I am ex-USAF and ex-USN, an amatuer astronomer, have been around the world and been exposed to many types of aircraft. This did not resemble and aircraft. It had no contrail, and it was too far away to see if it had navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((Revised report submitted))<n> <n><n> <n><n> Daylight sighting of a distant, pin-point light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Enroute home from work, at 1730, I was westbound, enroute home from work. I was observing a Tennessee Air National Guard C-141 making a right( North ) turn. As the C-141 started to straighten out, I noticed a bright, but very small point of light, appear from behind the plane. I could not discern any motion, during to my driving toward it. It appeared as Venus might in the daylight, but definitely before evening. A small point, it would have easily been missed by most people. This was a day after a severe rain/thunderstorm that created tornados. The sky was crystal clear. No other observers. I stopped at the side of the road to see if I could re-acquire the object but didn&#39;t have any luck. The initial sighting &#34;feeling&#34; was a solid object, reflecting sunlight. The object, to my observation, was a. very high, b. bright and very far away. We are so close to Arkansas, across the Mississippi River, that it had to be OVER Arkansas, not Tennessee, when observed.<n>

I saw a bright light with an aura around it in the opposite direction of the sun. I took my glasses off and observed it more. It moved in circles after about 5 minutes. Then I realized another aircraft was &#34;chasing&#34; it. I watched the light try to stay away from the disk-like figure. At on point, after about 20 minutes, the light changed blue and &#34;shot&#34; something at the other craft. The other craft then had the blue glow around it and in a couple seconds completely vanished. When the blue thing was shot out, there was a quiet, yet irratating hum.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a trust worthy student that has been interested in UFO sitings as long as i can remember.

You always hear jets in Anchorage, but not real high. I looked up and saw two military jets from Elmendorf Airforce base traveling S.E. at a very high altitude, traveling very close together. Could barley make out jets shape, estimate 50,000 feet. I looked ahead of where they were going and saw a large circular ojbect, shining like a star, motionless in the sky. As the jets approached it they separated. One went left around it, the other went right then came back closer together after they passed it. The object stayed put and didn&#39;t move. The jets continued on S.E. and dissappeared above clouds. Watched object for about 2 minutes more, then it took of at super high speed north, dissappeared in less than 5 seconds. The jets came back but couldn&#39;t find it.<n>

I was having a scard feeling about my back yard for about a month. Before this I use to sit in my back yard at night and enjoy the pease and quite. But all of a sudden after I was haveing this health problem I was scard of going outside at night. Then one night I woke up and saw my bedroom drenched in light, and heard my dog fall on the bed. I swear I am not joking. I had this weir feeling that I was being experimented on and that was the cause of the bleeding and pain.

It looked about 1/2 the size of Mars and was flying in a short zig-zag hopping fashion from the south to the north in the eastern sky.  It seemed to be far too high for a helicopter (maybe 30,000 feet). When I went to the front yard to see if it continued in the same direction it could not be seen in any part of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My back yard is on the south side of my yard. At about 22:30 I looked up toward the eastern sky.  I believe that the planet visible in that part of the sky at that time of night is the planet Mars. I noticed that the planet was slightly above and east of what seemed to be two overlapping red balls of light, one on the left and the other on the right.  The red lights were about half the size of the planet but equal to its brightness.  A bright white light kept flashing in strobe fashion from the midst of the red lights. Althought they constantly moved in a northerly direction, the lights moved from the south toward the north in short zig-zagging eastward and westward  hops. I watched for about a half minute before entering my house and going to the front yard to see if the lights were continuing in the same direction. When I reached the front yard on the north side of my house I could not find the lights in any part of the sky.  Thinking that something could be obstruc- ting my view, I walked fifty feet to the west and fifty feet to the east of my house for a different perspective.  I was still unable to find a sign of the lights in any direction or at any distance.<n>

It was about the size of a Volkswagon bug, and it was approximately 100-200 yards above us. It didn&#39;t streak past us, but it did seem to be moving fast.  Then it just went out, like someone turned the light on it out.  I&#39;m pretty sure that other motorists must have also seen this.  It was hard to miss.<n>

We saw about eight different shapes, weirdest things they were, and they were just going around and around counter-clockwise in a circle.  Now, we knew it was 9:30 because we&#39;d just looked at our watches, but after staring at them for awhile, we looked again at my watch out of habit and it was 10 o&#39;clock.  We stared at them again, and then there was a bright flash and they were gone.  That&#39;s it.<n>

A bright pinpoint of light appeared in the West-Southwest sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving back to Gulfport, MS in my car, after a weekend visit to my hometown of St. Louis. The sun had just set, but the sky was clear and still too bright to see any stars yet. As I drove on southbound I-55 through the short stretch of Arkansas before Memphis, a bright pinpoint of light caught my attention in my peripheral vision. It was in the West Southwest sky, at roughly 2 o&#39;clock on a clockface, as I faced South. It was bright white, looked at first like a plane with the sun glinting off it. I then assumed it was a very bright star. I continued to watch the object, and noticed it did not move. There was no contrail. Suddenly, the object began to fade and lose brightness, and appeared to almost &#34;implode&#34; upon itself, until it disappeared completely. It was like watching a star burn out.  Fascinated, I continued to watch that space in the sky. Sure enough, about 2 minutes later, the bright object faded back &#34;ON&#34;, until it was at its former brightness.  It didn&#39;t stay bright as long as the previous time, but again, faded out slowly til it was not visible any more.  I tried to notice if any other southbound drivers or truckers had seen the strange light.  I only wish I had had a cb at that moment; I could have asked the truckers to look up, or ask them if they had also seen it.<n>

I was looking at what I thought was this star in the southern sky when it quickly doubled it&#39;s brightness and seemed to get a bit bigger too, this happened again, and then again, until it seemed to have rays of light coming off of it as one might draw a star. I ran down stairs to get my roomate and brought her up on the roof within a few minutes. I pointed to it and told her what happened. It began to move slowly toward the east and was soon obscurred by a building. She insisted it was a plane. We both went inside at this point and went to bed.<n>

They were pale orange points of light and moved in a strange scrambling kind of motion. I attempted to see if they were attached to anything but they weren&#39;t which led me to think I was seeing something unusual. After a few moments I described what I saw to my friend who was a passenger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AS the lights moved across the road in front of the vehicle proceeding at 50MPH I watched them to see if they might be a reflection or something explainable but they continued from left to right and wound up at the curb to the right still making their random scrambling movement. I saw no object only the lights. They moved less than a foot off the ground. I wondered later if they may have been attached to some kind of animal but discounted that because of their motion and I would have seen an animal in the headlights.

On this night she called me outside to look at what she thought was a peculiar star in the sky. I came outside, looked at it and told her that it was ice crystals far up in the atmosphere causing the effect. I went back inside and within three minutes she had called me back out again. This time the star had moved !! I made sure to look at it from the same location both times so as not to distort my perception of what I was seeing. From our point of view the star/object moved from being over the top of a tree to its side in just a matter of 3 to 4 minutes. I stood and looked at the object for close to 10 minutes. I just to stay in one spot when my wife and I noticed that it was moving out of our line of sight behind the tree. I told her her to keep and eye on it while I got the car keys. We both got into my convertable and headed of in the direction of the object. My wife noticed that as soon as we got into the car the object shot of at great speed to the west. We drove down Hwy. 40 heading towards Folkston looking for the object in the sky. We were halfway between Kingsland and Folkston when I said to my wife that I saw a red light to our left in a clearing as we drove. She saw it but our view was obstructed by a group of trees as we drove more. Within just few seconds my wife and I saw the same red light on the opposite side of the road still above the tree line. My wife started to get scared so I turned around and went back home. It was only upon us discussing the matter when we back home that she told me that she remembered seeing the shape of the object for a brief moment. She said that it did not really occur to her how big the object appeared because she had quick view of it as we were driving. She said that it looked like a pyramid shape. At this point this when I knew we had a bonified sighting. The next night an even more spookier event happened to us. This time we purposely set out see if we could ge! t closer without (detection).(I don&#39;t how or why, but my wife and I knew somehow that the craft could sense our attention of it) The second night when we saw that the same star like object was in the same position as the night before we jumped into the car and drove off down Hwy. 40 again. This time we went as far as Folkston and started driving up Hwy 82 towards Tifton. We could not really tell if anymore if the starlike object we had seen was still there so after driving on 82 for 10 miles I started to turn around go back home. As soon as I slowed and turn my blinker on to make a U turn a bright light popped on in the sky above the tree line and to our right. I kept going forward to see it more. As we got closer I could see that the object was passing over the trees directly to our right. The thing that really capped this night for me and my wife was that there were two to three other cars ahead of us stopped on the side of the road with some of the people out of there cars looking at the light as it went by. I raced back in the direction of the light heading towards home. We both lost site of it. On the way back home we got a little lost on one of the back roads but eventually made it back home. We stood in our driveway now at home looking still up into the sky. Before we went in we saw a craft come directly over our neighborhood that made NO SOUND what so ever. Not even wind noise. At the level it was we both said that we should have heard something. The next morning I got up early right as the sky  begining to blue. I looked out of our bay window and saw that up in the morning sky at about 75 degrees was a brilliant object just hanging in mid air to the south west sky. I looked on for about 6 to 7 minutes and then just dismissed it as a star I got dressed for work and came back out to Our bay window for another look. It was gone!

About 20 min. later, the object was then being pursued by plane.  Object changed color from red to blue to green in a short time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event started approx. at 20:20 in McEwen, TN.  My parents were outside when my mother (legal secretary) looked up and saw something in the sky. She called out my brother and his wife to look at the same thing.  About 20 minutes later they called me (college student) in a town about 2 hrs. away to make sure that they were not looking at a star or a comet.  The first object that they saw changed from a red, to a green, and then to a blue in a short period of time, and had repeated to do so.  At 20:30, my brother noticed an aircraft following along the same tragechtory as the frist craft.  The second craft appeared at about 20:40 and did a color change similar to the other craft.  At 21:00, both craft were to far down on the horizon for anyone to see clearly.  Throughout this entire time, my brother attempted to use a telescope to look more closely at either craft.  He was unable to maintain focus on either of the craft.<n>

It was about 1/4mile away and about 500ft in altitude.  We observed it through open windows in our car.  The weather was clear and sunny and we watched it fly over several local hills for a little less than a minute until it passed behind a larger hill and we could no longer see it.  It was coming from the south and headed toward the north and was moving slowly (about 90mph-although it was hard to gauge accurate speed), and it was completely silent.  We heard no noise whatsoever, which is what surprised us the most. Being as that it was so low we thought we should be able to hear it.  Our backgrounds:  I work in the computer industry and the other adult witness works in construction metals salesmanagement.  We are both in our mid-30&#39;s. We are making no claim that this was any type of extraterrestrial craft, only that it was unidentifiable, flying and an object.<n>

I watched for a second or two and glanced back down at the paper. I looked back out the window and noticed the object was still there, however this time it slowly inploded itself. I found this very odd and continued to watch the same area of sky, no more than 30 seconds later it &#34;expanded&#34; from what seemed to be the same area of sky, it was now back to its original size and color(which seemed to be a hazzy oval shape brighter than the blue sky in the background) it then inploded itself again and came back to its original size, it did this several times and never seemd to leave my field of view(as if it too were moving) by this time I called attention to this object to the other passenger in the car, at that moment a second object appeard just to the upper left of the first, it was the same size and color, they both faded in and out, circled onanother at a high rate of speed and were gone. this went on for 10-15 minutes, giving a plane plenty of time to leave my field of view. Anyone else see this? or have any similar experiences?<n>

Our Ship was about 150 miles off the coast of Cape Canaveral.  (The date and time of this event is off because it has been a while. ) bearing at 270 degrees on the horizon was a bright and shiny object that flew to our ship and stopped above. It took about 1 mabye 2 seconds to get from the horizon to our ship. It stopped above our ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was on the top of our ship  , above the bridge, which is where we stood for lookout. It was bright but it did not hurt my eyes. the water around our ship  looked like water would look at night if someone spotlighted it. what i found strange was i could look at the light without any glare. During this event, the bridge was communicating with me. Everyone thought at first it was a flare. The Captain was a sleep, because it was mistaken for a flare the Captain was awaken , which is protocol for a &#34;MayDay call&#34;.  I relayed what i was looking at back to the bridge. The object was so large i thought it was only 40 feet above us. Seconds later i found out from the bridge the object is 1 mile above us and 3 miles in circumfrence. _-Very Large - After that their was communiction over the radio that the same thing had happened to other vessels in the area. Another strange thing was that in parts of our ship where their was no light or windows for light , lit up during this event. minutes later i am explaining myself to the Captain what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not ridiculed at all. To many people on our crew of 55 seen it. The next morning our Captain took the crew on deck and told us that he was ordered by an Admiral in the Navy to tell us &#34;That we are not to talk about what we saw ever again off or on the ship&#34; and if we did we would have to answer to him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was standing in my back yard smoking a cigarette when I saw a v shaped formation of 7 lights (the upper arm had four lights, the lower three) at about 45 degrees above the horizon to the east. They moved approximately south to north, with no sound, and were of equal color, size, and luminosity as the stars in the background. They moved at about the speed of an ordinary jet aircraft at relatively close range, and I observed them briefly before my line of sight was obscured by trees. I thought it unusual that there were no blinking or colored lights that you would expect to see on ordinary aircraft. My only guess is that they were a formation of stealth fighters, or a single stealth bomber from Canon AFB. My initial impression however, was that the lights represented a single object that was larger than a single fighter and relatively close based on it&#39;s speed.<n>

Anyway, I was 12 years old and me and my old best friend were camping in my backyard. At around 2:00AM the sprinklers came on and woke us up. We rushed outside the tent tp put a cover over us and we had some trouble trying ro get back to sleep. Bored took control and we looked for something to do. I had a few books and we read a few of them outload for some entertainment. It was my friends turn to read and as he was reading I looked outside then tent window. I gazed into the sky it was extremely clear out. One star caught my attention. It wasnt the movement thought that caught me at first. It was how bright it was. Slightly brighter then most of the stars. It was Northeast of us and I couldnt take my eyes off it. Then I noticed movement. Extremely slow movement. If you werent staring at the star and concentrating you wouldnt of noticed it. I told my friend to take a look and he used the binocculars he brang when we went hiking earlier that night. After focusing for about 15minutes we began to hear weird noises from the back side of the wall behind my house. More than likely it was animals. So we shrugged it off and looked at the star again. After another 5minutes I lost interest and picked up the book again. Like 30 seconds later my friend kept saying &#34;Oh shoot, oh shoot, look!&#34; before I even looked all the hairs on my body were standing on end. I looked out the window and froze. A triangular like craft was hovering 20 feet from me right over my backyard wall. The lights were bring but seemed to be pointed and concentrated on a few parts of the yard. It had exactly four lights. One on each corner of the craft and one dead center.     Each angle one the craft was equivalent. You couldnt tell which angle was the from of the ship. It made no noise whatsoever it was almost like it sucked the sound out of world around us. I knew it wasnt a plain because it was PERFECTLY still and the shape was too perfect to be anytype of plane. I live on the front of the San Bernardino MTS so it was also too low to be a plane. The only available thing left to assume is a helicopter but again it was silent no noise whatsoever. This is my only explaination. Anyway, it sat there for about 3 to 4 miutes and I never spoke or took my eyes off it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In an instant it left to the distance still visible. When I mean distance i mean like half a second or less. And we watched it fly accross the sky at extreme speeds. It was one hell of an experiance. Afterwords we sat still for another 2minutes unable to speak or move. We ran to my mothers room and told her and that was about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My old best friend isnt my fiend anymore. He did some stuff with my sister and that drove me away and last I saw him he was really really into drugs. I dont kno where or how he is now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
