Were aliens looking for thier dead ?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was laying on my bed and was looking out the window. I saw what I thought was a shooting star (meteor, didn&#39;t know the proper name then. I was about ten years old.). It was moving very slowly which I thought was unusual. Before I knew it, I realized it was not a meteor but a sphere and it was desending above the house Across the street. It was bright, but did not give off a whole lot of light. It moved very slowly and hovered at the porch of our nieghbors house. I ran across the room to wake up my sisters to look at it. When I reached thier bed, my older sister was kneeling on her bed and looking out the window. I told her &#34;Do you see that?&#34;. She said &#34;Yes, and it took off real fast&#34;. I looked to where it was and it was already gone. We never told anyone or discussed it. I don&#39;t think we even remembered the next day until we were adults and we taked about it then. I thought I would tell our story before we are both gone and niether one of us is here to tell it and back each other up. Also visted Roswell a few years back and my brother-in-law told me he had seen a sphere by the cemetery and discrbed it the same as wht my sister and I had seen. I told him I had seen a similair object when I was a kid. He was grateful for me telling him that because he thuoght he was seeing things that were not real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
