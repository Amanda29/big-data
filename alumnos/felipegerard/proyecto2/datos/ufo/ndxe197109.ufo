It was a nice sunny day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While we stood there, one of us said &#34;look at that, what is that&#34;? ?   We all looked up and off to the North, we all saw a cigar shaped object just sitting in the sky.  It didn&#39;t move at all.  It was too high up to see any lights but we all saw it and the shape of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After what seemed like a couple minutes, the object shot off so fast we almost didn&#39;t see it.  It shot sideways and disappeared.  No one ever talked about it because we didn&#39;t think anyone would believe us.  But my sisters and I have talked about it.  We know it was a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/24/71 22:00|Worthing, Sussex (UK/England)||Oval|15 mins|The Truth about UFO'S|12/12/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73472.html|2|ndxe197109| The Truth about UFO&#39;S<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its been such a long time ago, but its still very clear in my mind but the date may be wrong, it could be 1972.  I lived on Lamleys Lane, Worthing, Sussex England.  I had been married the year before, the cottage we lived in was the last house on the Lane going north up the hill, next to the barns and tractor sheds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night my first husband and I retired about 10:00pm.  After being in bed about 10 minutes I could hear a humming noise, I thought it was our electric kettle, maybe I left it on.  I went down stairs into the kitchen, No it was not the kettle it was unplugged.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Still hearing the hum I searched for it&#39;s where abouts I pulled the bedroom curtains open to check outside the house.  There it was as plain as day, I could not belive my eyes.  A space ship oval in appearence with flashing lights around the middle they were white, and the craft was spinning.  This is where the humming was coming from.  It was stationary above the hill in front of me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called my husband to come and look because he was a none believer.  We watched it for about 15 minutes then all of a sudden it began to move, it went to the right, then to the left and was gone in a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 seconds later 2 military aircraft flew right over the position where I had seen and heared the spacecraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have told a few people about my experience those that were close to me because people would think I was nuts or lying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened it has stayed in my mind all these years and the sound, it&#39;s an experience you never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe now this was not aliens, its our future coming back for some unkown reason.  Why did they not want to be caught?  Because it would change the future.<n>

We were going home for a visit from college in Portland Oregon to Longview Washington.  Right before entering Woodland Washington we passed a huge freshly plowed field.  In the middle of this huge field was a two story farmhouse. I was just casually looking at the view when I saw a saucer shaped disc hovering at roof level of this home. It was brown, saucer shaped with a dome in the middle. It appeared to be as long as the roof of the house. Along the side of this craft there were windows, round ones and at one end of it a &#34;fin&#34;? or something slightly projecting upward like a tail or a shark fin.  It just hovered there at roof level and moved ever so slightly.  Underneath this craft there was some turbulence like the bushes appeared to be swaying bath and forth. I told my roomate about this and told her were to look and she took one long stare, turned to me and said....... &#34;If you tell anybody about this I will deny it!&#34; This scene lasted the entire time it took to pass from view. I never did tell anybody for years.  It still haunts me to this day so to tell someone who will listen is a cleansing moment for me.  I am truly not alone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/15/71 23:00|Hazlet|NJ|Disk|10 Minutes|Large saucer, rotating lights, low hover, late night, family of 5, witnessed 1971, NJ|10/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/065/S65289.html|4|ndxe197109| Large saucer, rotating lights, low hover, late night, family of 5, witnessed 1971, NJ<n> <n><n> <n><n> In approximately 1971 at 11:00 PM, when I was 5 years old, Mom, Dad, two Sisters and myself returned home from our Aunt&#39;s house in Summit, NJ. We lived in Monmouth County, NJ, not far from the Raritan Bay. Our house faced nearly due West. The night was average temperature, not hot, cold or uncomfortable. I am not sure if it was Spring or Autumn, but something tells me it was around September.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember my Father parking the Dodge Dart in the street because the driveway had a steep upward slope and the walkway was a more comfortable grade. It was late and we were tired.  As we made our way up the walk one of my sisters told us to look above the neighbor&#39;s house on the corner of our street, to the southwest of our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Above the corner lot was a large craft with white lights, apparently spinning and hovering about 100 feet above a neighbor&#39;s house, diagonally across the street. For reference, if you were to hold your hands out at arms length at the width of a Frisbee, that would be an accurate reference of the craft&#39;s size. It was very large and low to the rooftop.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We stood silently watching the saucer for what seemed to be about 5 minutes, then the craft moved directly above us, hovered for a minute, and shot due east over the house amazingly fast, - almost instantaneously. I remember not being able to see the sky while I leaned my head all the way back looking up, not hearing a sound. After the craft flew away, my Father commented “It must be some kind of advertisement”. We walked inside and nobody said a word about the event for 18 years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eighteen years later in October, I was with my girlfriend, now my wife, in Long Beach Island, NJ. I remember that we had been dating for 5 years at that time, as we met in November of 1984. A good friend and his parents were loaned a house on the beach for the weekend and we stayed with them. I remember the day very well, the weather was cloudy and warm – and the water was still a perfect temperature for swimming. The water in NJ doesn&#39;t start turning cold until late October, so I estimate that date as being early October in 1989.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night we went out to dinner near LBI. The conversation turned to UFO&#39;s, and I mentioned for the first time that I had a couple of encounters when I was young. My now-wife and friend didn&#39;t believe me at first because I had never mentioned it to either of them before. In fact, the saucer event was common knowledge at home, but my family never told anyone outside the house about it. It wasn&#39;t because we were shy or embarrassed, it was just that the topic never surfaced. Even writing this is difficult for me since something in the back of my mind is telling me to forget about it - but I can&#39;t. Nor can I forget several other encounters, some of which I still can&#39;t explain. This is the third time I wrote about this encounter in the past year with the intention of sending it to you, but previously deleted it. Anyway, I told everyone my story that night and all were amazed that nobody said a word about it. To this day I can&#39;t explain why we didn&#39;t tell anyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were other encounters too, one in which my eldest sister shared with my Father and me. I can detail that story in another form and submit it if this one interests you. The second sighting deals with hieroglyphics circling around a small, gold saucer hovering over the Shrewsbury / Navesink River in Red Bank, NJ. For years it registered as a dream to me, but both my Father and Sister remembered it clearly. My sister still talks about how we tried to understand the letters moving around the craft, but they were different than anything we had ever seen. I know that I have the characters etched in my  memory, somewhere. One looked like lambda, as I recall it now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My stories are truthful accounts that I can&#39;t explain. I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by sharing them. I have live witnesses who remember it clearly. Dad passed away last year, but Mom and my two sisters were there. Dad wouldn&#39;t discuss it anyway since he worked in the Avionics industry, and he had a security clearance. He would definitely lose his job if he talked about the topic. Now that he&#39;s gone there is no risk to him, so I decided to tell the story. There is also a neighbor who still lives at the end of my prior street, and she saw the craft as well. She was terrified when she heard our story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please keep in mind that I have bosses, co-workers and clients who will drop me like a bad habit if they were to find out who I am. I have no problem sharing my experiences, but I can&#39;t reveal my identity; or for now anyway, I don&#39;t feel very comfortable in doing so. I am licensed Professional Land Surveyor in 2 states.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Along with several other creepy encounters there is also an amazing experience, with documented survey data relating to my profession that I can share with you. For now, I only have time to tell about the first encounter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I jumped in the car and sped back toward the intersection.I almost didn&#39;t get stopped and would have collided with a tractor trailer truck.When I looked around all I could see was some blinking lights off in the distance.I headed home and told my parents,only to be laughed at.I told my boss at work the next day and he laughed too.So I just didn&#39;t talk too much about it anymore.I know what I saw was real and I was not under the influence of anything.A few years later I found out that I wasn&#39;t the only one to see the object.A guy(who is a baptist preacher now),his brother,and mother saw the object just up the road a mile or so from where I saw it.He said his little brother got down in the floor of the car and started praying.He also said his mother went back to the sight almost everyday for 2 weeks.I know it&#39;s been! a long time since I saw this,but I still have a vivid memory of it.That&#39;s the only time I&#39;ve ever seen anything like that,but I look to the sky often.Who knows?<n>

After eating, the teenage kids decided to follow the demonstration forest path to the top of the hill to look out at the Pacific Ocean.  A friend and I were at the front of the group.  When we got to the top of the hill we saw that there were hundreds or thousands of shiny triangular objects lying in the grass.  At first I thought they were lightning bugs, but they weren’t moving and were a crystal white color.  I started to pick one up, but one of the girls in the group screamed and we all started back down the hill together.  I thought that I would get one the next trip up the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After getting to the bottom of the hill, we all finally started the walk back up the hill.  About halfway up, I stopped and asked my friend if he also saw what I saw in the path ahead of us and he said yes.  Standing in the path was a gray figure that appeared to be bald and naked.  The creature (for lack of a better description) had large black eyes.  It seemed skinny with joints and finger tips that were bulbous.  Its hands had fewer fingers that we do, but its hands were larger and they hung at the knees.  We stared at each other for what seemed to be several minutes. The rest of the group had started later than my friend and I so no one was directly behind us on the trail.  Suddenly one of the girls screamed and the creature leapt like a cat, with arms first, into the bushes along the path.  My friend looked at me and asked if I thought that it was going to head us off down the path.  That was enough for me to start running down the hill.  Needless to say I didn’t go bac! k up the hill to get one of the triangular objects in the grass.  I tried to tell the adults at the dinner about what we saw, but my friend clammed up and said that he hadn’t seen anything.  Through the years, I have told a few people of this encounter and have always gotten a laugh so I don’t tell anyone anymore,<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

He said he wanted to tell me because I was a scientist (actually an archaeologist).<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said he had been visiting our family lawyer who had been a judge for many years, in his hospital room a few weeks before he died.  The judge told my uncle that he wanted to tell him something he had never told anybody because of the sensitive nature of the story and his being a past judge and lawyer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He said he was out dove hunting in the woods with his wife and two friends just before sunset.   He said all of a sudden a large circular shaped object about 60 &#39; in diameter came over them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They got scared and got in their jeep and started back to the ranch house.   A cylinder of light came down from the craft that was the same in diameter as the UFO and followed them all the way back to the house.  They never left the circle of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once they arrived at the house, they jumped f! rom the jeep and ran inside.  The craft then came directly over the house.  The light was so intense, it actually came through the roof and ceiling of the house and into the room where they stood.  It hovered over the house for some minutes and then went away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason for finally telling this story is that there was no reason for my uncle to lie (he didn&#39;t drink at this time), and certainly there was no reason for the judge to make up such a story on his deathbed.  I just thought some one should hear this story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/15/71 10:30|San Antonio|TX|Oval|1 minute|Daylight sighting of an oval shaped lighted phenomena appears and reappears several times|3/2/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35192.html|8|ndxe197109| Daylight sighting of an oval shaped lighted phenomena appears and reappears several times<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sitting in my 7th grade math class at Riley Jr. High (now Martin Luther King jr. High) listening to, along with the rest of the class, the teacher&#39;s lecture.  It was a morning class, and I believe it was about 10:30 am.  I was sitting by the window and happened to look out toward the east (about 30 degrees to my right) and saw an odd lighted shape, sort of like the left half of a lighted oval, at about 20 degrees above the horizon.  Toward the east is an area with a few houses and about a half mile of heavily wooded and at the time undeveloped land on either side of Salado Creek (the creek was about a quarter mile to the east of the school and runs north to south ).  That land currently contains Martin Luther King Park.  It was a largely clear day, but it seemed as though the lighted oval was behind a patch of cloud.  This shaped did not appear to be a solid object.  There was no noise associated with this sighting.  There was no noise associated with this sighting and I do not recall seeing or hearing any other aircraft in the area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While trying to figure out what this shape was, the shape faded away.  A few seconds later, the shape reappeared slightly to the right and above the first location.  This time it was brighter, with a distinct symmetrical oval shape to the phenomena, and bright white in the interior.  In the middle of this oval was what looked like a thin bright horizontal line, much like a filament in a light bulb, which was centered in the oval and taking up about half the horizontal dimension of this oval.  This central filament type light was bright, but not painful to look at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, there was no question in my mind that I was seeing something that was unlike any aircraft that I had ever seen.  San Antonio in 1971 had substantial Vietnam related military flight activity from Ft. Sam Houston, Randolph AFB, and Kelly AFB, especially the frequent low level helicopter flights of UH-1 Huey helicopters.  Whatever I was looking at was nothing like any military or civilian aircraft I have seen either before or since (as an adult, I became a licensed pilot and was an Air Force flight test engineer).<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was about to get the attention of the classmate sitting in front of me it faded out once more.  It came into view a third time, again slightly above and to the left of the previous appearance.  Like the first view, it appeared to be behind some kind of mist or light cloud and was only partially visible, with the left and top part of the shape being visible.  The bright filament was not visible, and this time I could see what looked like a very small reddish tapered dome on top.  The tapered dome was relatively small, roughly one tenth the width of the full oval and about one fifth the thickness of the main oval.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds, it faded away again.  I looked all around the sky for it and about ten seconds later saw almost directly overhead a white light fade in an out of view twice.  It did so at a rate roughly the same as the interval between the first three sightings of the phenomena.  However, these last two were more points of light and I could not discern any shape to it.  The entire sighting lasted roughly one minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took a fair bit of ridicule about this whenever I mentioned it, so I kept quiet about it.  About two years later when I was in high school, a classmate (who I had never told about my sighting) related a story about some odd phenomena he saw one night in the same general part of town near Salado Creek.  When I asked him to explain how it looked, he described the oval shape and the filament type light in the middle.  I could not tell from his description if it was exactly the same phenomena I had observed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was returning from a trip to the Colorado River with my boyfriend. It was very late at night, as we waited until it was cooler, to avoid driving during the daytime heat.  We had left Parker on the Calif/Arizona border and were on Hwy 62 going toward Desert Center and I-10. It was midweek and late at night, so there was no traffic at all and very dark night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Coming toward us over the road and from above, came a very fast large white light that swooped down at our car and then straight back up.  It was moving so fast it trailed light as it went. It made no sound and it arched sharply as it went back up as it approached the car.  We both leaned forward over the dash to try to see it as it went up.  It happened so quickly, but we stopped the car immediately and got out. We could see quite a distance around us, but it was already gone in a matter of seconds.  Over the years, I did the usual guessing &#34;it must have been a top secret government plane, etc&#34;  But as a reasonable person today, I know for a fact that there is nothing today that could move like that, and certainly nothing that many years ago.  I am convinced that the UFO spotted a single light moving in what must have been a vast amount of ground darkness and came down and buzzed us to see what we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I don&#39;t remember the exact date.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking an evening graduate level chemistry class on the north side of Indianapolis. Class had finished and I was walking through the parking lot to my car. It was about sunset. The sky was clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some bright, moving objects in the western sky caught my attention. I remember three objects. Two of them were tracing out a more or less circular path about 180 degrees opposed to each other, as if they were orbiting around a common center and trying to stay as far apart as possible. The third object was moving in its own oval path to the south of the first two.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the objects moved, they would reflect the setting sun, then the reflection would fade and a dark shape could be seen. This is similar to how the sunlight plays off an airliner near sunset, and at first I thought the objects were planes in a holding pattern. However, something that&#39;s hard to put my finger on held my attention - something unfamiliar about the shape, or maybe the way the objects seemed to glide or float, different from the way a plane flies. They also didn&#39;t seem to bank as they turned. I could hear no sound or see any lights on the objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued to watch, the third object, the one farthest to the south, started to move east, directly toward me. It passed almost directly overhead and continued east until it was lost in the dusk. As it passed overhead I got a good look at it. The main part of the object was crescent-shaped and seemed to be made of a dull-finished material. It looked dull red as it was overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Projecting back from the center of the crescent was a sort of stubby rectangular &#34;fuselage&#34; that was highly reflective, like polished metal. This was the part that reflected the sun. There was no sign of a tail assembly of any kind or engines. There was no sound, contrails, or lights, nor could I see any windows. I remember the object seeming to be in the size range of an asprin tablet to a dime held at arm&#39;s length. It&#39;s hard to estimate the object&#39;s altitude and true size. As I said, it was about sunset, but due to buildings and trees I couldn&#39;t tell if the sun had actually gone below the horizon. My first impression was that the sun was down, and the object was very high to catch its last rays, which meant it had to be huge. If the sun had still not set, the object could have been lower and smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the object went out of sight, the first two objects were still circling in the west. I&#39;d guess the whole observation lasted about five minutes. I don&#39;t know if anybody else in the parking lot saw the objects or not, and I was too fixed on observing to call anybody&#39;s attention to them. I never reported the incident, only told a few family members.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While this is an old sighting, I thought it might be of interest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in September 1971 is approximate.

It was a full moon that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sitting in the car with a friend, listening to his new stereo.  I was enjoying the evening and the light of the full moon, and the shadows it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then, as I was looking around I noticed the shadows, were gone yet in the short distance there was still light, and shadows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a clear night before and I had seen no clouds, so as I went to look up in the night sky, to see if there was a cloud, covering my moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned, shocked, in full AW, could not believe what I was seeing.  Above my home was this round object above our house, at a Maple trees height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We, lived in an old school house, (chiminey was 7ft. tall)  and with the trees right there it was kinda easy to judge height.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was absolutly no sound coming from it.  I got out of the car, and went up to the house and opened the door, and hollared at my mom to come here, she didn&#39;t come said she was busy.  As, I stood there holding the, door I again hollared at my mom to come here.  She told me again she was busy.  Thats when I hollared again, mom get your damn ass out here, you have to see this, my dad was mad in the background.  She, came and was she pissed, As, I pointed up, I apologized to her.  we both stood there looking, shaking, nervous , excited and all.  In disbeleif.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As, we stood there watching, we seen lights come on, they were around the outside rim, of th craft.  Still, no sound.  Then, it moved away very slowly, and still no noise.  It headed into the field to the west. And, just that fast it was gone, in a flash.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

When I came up around fraternity row I immediately saw a red object floating stationary over the campus adjacent to Carnagie hall art building.I pointed it out to my friends and immediately pulled over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On an impulse I jumped out of my Volkswagen and ran down to where it was.  Keeping the trees between me and it, I was able to get real close to it.  I remember several small beings in white suits with head coverings who looked somewhat oriental.  They seemed to be possibly taking samples or something similar to that.  I was behind a large pine tree observing them and impulsively,again, stepped out into the open and said HI or hello.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This startled them and I took off running back to the car.  About halfway back I stopped and looked back at the craft.  It remained motionless but changed in color from red to light red to dull yellow to white and shrunk into a small dot just like the tv picture tubes of the 60&#39;s used to do.  Then that small light shot into space in the blink of an eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran the rest of the way to my car and we were all excited by the event.My friend MJ said he saw green and white lights on the bottom and I remember being upset with him because I did not see them.  This sighting really changed my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That night I called the Orono police to find out if anyone else had seen it as it was in a prominent place over campus only maybe 40&#39; in the air and also next to several dorms.  The police said no reports taken and the next day I posted a flier at the student union asking if anyone had seen it, but got no response back.  The sighting was very clear in my mind but after that I have had very unclear memories of seeing profiles thru Windows (of the craft?)  And of being inside it (lit up bright and open and empty)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
9/1/71 15:00|Buffalo|NY|Triangle|less than 1 min.|Silent, unmarked arrowshaped aircraft flying low over the University at Buffalo.  Was it an experiment?|1/11/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21126.html|13|ndxe197109| Silent, unmarked arrowshaped aircraft flying low over the University at Buffalo.  Was it an experiment?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had all but forgotten about it until one evening when I saw a woman on a UFO special.  She described a ship and showed a rough sketch of it.  It shocked me!  I got excited and began to jump around the room shouting, &#34;That&#39;s mine! That&#39;s mine! I saw that!&#34;  My companion didn&#39;t know what to think of me and was quite incredulous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> September, 1971 I was two months from my twentieth birthday.  I was in the habit of taking rather long walks, especially on mild and pretty autumn days as this one was.  I found myself walking along Main Street in Buffalo, in front of the State University of New York at Buffalo.  In those days, there was not yet a northern campus.  I was walking north on Main Street, nearing the front of Hayes Hall.  The sight of it is remeniscent of days when a stately appearance inspired respect in the viewer.  I was busy thinking to myself that there was no one anywhere to be seen.  A thing came flying west over Hayes Hall at a very low altitude, from the direction of Bailey Avenue on the opposite side of the campus.  What was it doing there?  This was not the airspace I would normally see aircraft use.  Was this an experiment of the University?  Was this a military experiment?  This was Sunday.  Niagara Falls was the direction the craft was flying, but why was it so low and who could be flying it?  There were no windows.  As I watched this thing in wonder, I was greatly surprised that there was NO SOUND!  This thing was just above the trees and there was absolutely no sound.  I saw a heat signature at the back of the craft, that somehow gave me a kind of reassurance that I might be watching something I could relate to ; something within my experience.  But there was no Sound.  None.  There was no audible competion on the street.  No traffic. No people.  Just me watching that thing fly fly low over the University, the trees, me, the street and the houses.  It flew directly over me.  It was shaped like an arrowhead without a stem.  It&#39;s color was green, like an Army jeep; a new, clean one.  This was why I thought it might have been a military experiment.  But it had no markings on it.  Not on its side, not on its bottom.  Just the green of a new jeep.  And no sound.  I got so freaked out I still don&#39;t remember how I got home that day.  I know it didn&#39;t take me long, even though I residence at that time was five to six ! miles aw ay on the corner of Eagle and Madison.  I was so excited relating this sighting to my mother that she had a rough time trying to calm me down.  It was a very disturbing experience.  It is still disturbing repeating it here.  This was my second sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))<n>

My grandmother, mother and I were having an ice cream in the car outside a diner. About 45-50 degrees south we saw a silver sphere that appeared about 1/2 mile away. It was glistening from the sun hitting it. It was a clear day. Suddenly, the object shrunk up and disappeared completely. The sighting lasted about one minute.<n>
9/1/71 08:00|Humboldt|IA|Cigar|45 sec|Craft resembling a large blimp appears out of thin air from a cloudless sky  ,descends, lands and vanishes|1/22/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34596.html|15|ndxe197109| a craft resembling a large blimp appears out of thin air from a cloudless sky  ,descends, lands and vanishes<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother and I were traveling eastbound on state hwy 3 approximately 4-5 mi west of Humboldt, Ia. The sky was clear and there was not any other traffic. I was returning him home to our parents as he was 13 or 14 years old. He had been visiting me in the western part of the state. We were talking as I drove along and as if out of a science-fiction movie a large craft just appeared above and to the left of the road about 1-2 miles in front of us. I mean, I was looking ahead when this large craft just appears in the sky. It was descending abd was tilted down at about a 45 degree angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It then leveled itself over the highway then descended again, tilted down as before, and left my sight as there was a farm building sight with a grove of trees blocking my sight. That&#39;s when I turned to my brother and found him looking at me. At the same time we both said &#34;Did you see that?&#34;. We&#39;re still traveling east and getting closer to where we saw this thing land. I say &#39;land&#39; because we&#39;re in Iowa and we can see the farm place and all around the vicinity for a long way. I mean, we were really wondering what this was going to look like on the ground and close enough to the road to throw a rock and be able to hit it, to make a point. Probably a minute after we lost it from sight we were passing the farm place and there was&#39;nt anything there except a harvested bean field. We arrived at our parents house a couple of hrs. later and told them about what we had seen. Understand, it&#39;s been 33-34 years since this took place, but our oldest sister[17 at the time] it was either 1 or 2weeks later brought my attention to the Des Moines Sunday Register. On the front page the second bold -type heading read&#34; Mysterious burn spots found in soybean fields &#34; and went on to mention Iowa and surrounding states south and west of Iowa. My brother would not talk about this at all for maybe 23-24 years later. I don&#39;t have an explanation concerning what we saw that morning, but everytime I hear or see the word&#34;stealth&#34; I tend to shake my head a little. I&#39;d like to see our military make something the size and shape of the Goodyear blimp just &#34;appear out of thin air and then &#34;vanish&#34; into thin air. This report is as credible as our Earth orbiting the sun.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
