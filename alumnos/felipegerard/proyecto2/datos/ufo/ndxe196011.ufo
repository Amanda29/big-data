11/15/60 22:00|Kansas City|KS|Unknown|5 Min. (three occasions)|Two witnesses see ball of light come over horizon, then speed up and disappear before their eyes.|1/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34311.html|1|ndxe196011| Two witnesses see ball of light come over horizon, then speed up and disappear before their eyes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I and another witness see ball of light come over western horizon in Wyandotte County, moving at constant speed.  No other lights on it obvious.  No sound, no contrails.  Followed curveature of earth (this was very evident).  Once it reached the point directly overhead, it accelerated at warp speed and streaked across the sky like a meteor and disappeared.  There was still no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One week later, was driving by myself at approximately the same time of night at Wyandotte County Lake.  Saw what appeared to be the same light passing in front of me from left to right at roughly 45 degrees above the horizon.  Once again, when directly opposite me, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared at warp speed.  Again, no sound accompanied this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About one week after that, at about the same time of night (still in Wyandotte County), I was standing on the front porch of my house with my Dad, when we saw again what appeared to be the same light.  As we faced west, it was passing fairly high in the sky, travelling from the south/west to north/east.  No other apparent lights on it.  No sound.  It continued moving past us and then, as it passed into the north/east, it suddenly changed course moving back to the west.  And as it did this, once again, it suddenly accelerated and disappeared at warp speed.  No sound was heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))<n>
11/11/60 02:00|Sumner (Lake Tapps area)|WA|Sphere|30 seconds|Sphere with Spikes over Lake Tapps traveling West to East in 1960|8/28/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/030/S30794.html|2|ndxe196011| Sphere with Spikes over Lake Tapps traveling West to East in 1960<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was apx. five years old when I suddenly sat up in bed and looked out the window at a ball type greyish object with spikes sticking out of it moving from a westernly direction east and rotating slightly as it moved about 30 mph.  It appeared to be about 50 feet above our converted metro area bus that we used as a sleeping area.  It had window on both sides. I watched the object until it dissapeared above me.  I could not see it above the roof of the bus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked on the other side out the window and did not see it.  I seemed to have stopped over head.  As fast as I awoke I plopped back down asleep. I drew pictures of what I saw for my parents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Three years later I was in the library at school and noticed a book on UFO,s.  Inside I found a drawing of what I had seen and what others had seen.  It said that others had said they had seen small Greys come out of these spheres.  I don,t remember seeing any of them if there were any but as a kid I remember after reading that being a little scared and wondering if they had run sensors over me and that was what woke me up so suddenly.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
11/2/60 18:00|Westbury|NY|Disk|1 minute|Father Mother and son in car stopped in middle of street to see a saucer with lights around the rim hovering above their house.|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32536.html|3|ndxe196011| Father Mother and son in car stopped in middle of street to see a saucer with lights around the rim hovering above their house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving home on election night in L.I. N.Y. 1960 my father spotted something as we turn into our neighbourhood, he raced to our house, above it was a saucer shaped object with lights blinking different colors around the rim, about 40 - 50 ft.up, hovering for about a minute without any sound, it then move across the street for a few seconds and sped off. My father and mother and I would love to know what we saw that day just before dark. My father says he saw windows as if there was a room inside. This was a close encounter. He also had been telling us that he saw one in the distance while driving in Queens N.Y. around 1957.  He aligned the object with a pole as it was still and then it shot off in super speed. Of course my mother would always scoff when he told that story untill we all witnessed this one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
