They set up their camp near the river about 700&#39; from my house. Early one evening at approximately 10 PM I went down to join my brothers and their friends at their camp site. We started drinking, just beer and having fun when someone looked up and said, &#34;what is that?&#34; I looked up and above us, at tree top level was a luminous, (white) oval shape like a huge smoke ring about 30&#39;long and 15&#39; wide, clear in the center. Around the perifery, inside and outside this ring were erratic pulsating flashes of white light. I remember what struck me the most was the shape of the flashing lights as they were triangular and seemed very unnatural also  how it remained perfectly stationary. There were no colors except for white and no sound. We all stared up mystifed and watched this light show display for 30 minutes or more, no one could take their eyes off of it. After a while I began to become concerned for everyones safety, not knowing what this was and I demanded we all go back to the house which we did in the darkness. Some of the guys said it followed us back up to the house but I didn&#39;t notice this. I would really like to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

My brother and I were star gazing and saw what appeared to be a LARGE vehicle that had the appearance of a conventional aircraft but it had 6 sets of wings and was dotted with lights around the perimiter of the craft. It was also silent and very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting took place around 1980, but is still etched in my mind and will be forever. My brother and I would be outside every night to look for unusual things in the sky. One night just before dark on a warm summer evening with no clouds,we were looking at the apex of the sky when all of a sudden a huge craft floated silently ovrhead. We were both stunned at what we were seeing, our jaws dropped in awe. The craft appeared to a normal convetional aircraft at first but then we realised it was no air plane. The object had 6 sets of wing like appendages and the whole exterior of the craft was dotted with white lights and what appearerd to be a runway of sorts in the center. The object moved slowly over head and was completely silent. the oject also gave the appearance of being somewhat translucent,Im not sure how to explain it. It was just light enough to see the object so it could have been a reflection of some kind. I was about 18 years old at the time and my brother would have been around 20. We never reported this untill now for fear of riddcule. We did however tell our parents and some friends but they only laughed. I feel it important to note that there were no drugs or alcohol involved in the sighting. Please let me know if anyone else has seen an object like the one described in this report. this has been on my mind for a long time. Please let me know if you need additional information.<n>

It was white in color and moving 3 times the speed of an airplane.  It lasted for about 5 to seven seconds before I lost sight of it.  It was about the size of a nickel in the sky and was at a low altitude about 500 ft.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The crafts all of a sudden stopped in mid air for what seemed to be about 20 to 30 seconds, then , faster than anything I&#39;ve ever seen on this planet, they seemed to ricoshay off the stars, straight up in a zig zag fashon , unbelieveably fast, as fast as a snap of my fingers these two huge objects were out of sight<n>

It was oval shaped and white.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had yellow and red flashing lights around the outer edge. It hovered silently across the street from the house. Low in the sky and very visible. There were no windows or anything like an undercarriage. Absolutely no noise and for awhile no movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Incidentally, across the street from the house was the TRW Valve Division. I usually suspect that often these crafts are not so much otherworldly as they are from a foreign country. Quite possibly this was a spycraft taking pictures of TRW as they manufactured defense components etc. Just my suspicion in this instance, as the craft was hovering above a factory right next to TRW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After approx. 4 minutes, it silently left at great speed in a southwest direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

At that time they had remote outpost from the plant and not within the confines of the nuclear plant itself.  Afterwards, I became a Florida State Trooper.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was alone and at approx 1300 hours I was looking at a clear night sky, looking for falling stars and just gazing at the night sky, it was a very well moonlight type of night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden overhead at approx 2,000 feet, I began to see an object coming from the West heading to the east towards the Ocean.  The craft was dark and all I could see at first was a nose cone type shape.  As the object passed directly overhead, I realize the enormous size of this Triangular ship with NO sound.  It had to be aircraft carrier size and it was just floating by slowly.  I was in just awe of this thing and scared out of my wits.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could distinctly see port hole type windows on this perfectly triangle craft and I estimate that the thickness of its sides to be maybe 3 stories high.  As it passed I could also see 3 distinct circular huge propulshion systems with no sound and emitting a unbelievable white glow where we would normally see jet engines.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched this craft go out over the Atlantic Ocean heading East until it disappeared from my sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time I expected the entire plant to be going crazy and the radios going crazy, BUT there was not one single radio transmission or alarm and nothing was said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the end of my shift I expected someone to also say something about what I observed but no one did?  The only person I told this too was my mother and for the past 34 years I never told anyone else about this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I couldn&#39;t imagine a flying craft in the shape of a Triangle, until I saw the Phoenix lights.  Until then I thought maybe I was hallucinating or dreaming.  But I think of this incident often and can clearly see it in my memory as if it was yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I saw what happened in Phoenix, Arizona, it gave me more credence as to what I observed 34 years ago.<n>

I pulled to the side of the road and watched it for about 30 minutes, there was no other cars on the road while I was there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t see it move, but it was definately hovering.  The road I was on ran along the Lake Michigan shoreline, up on the bluff.  I was about 200-300 feet away from it, I certainly didn&#39;t want to get out of my car and check it out.  It was sitting in a side yard of the only house in the area and if it makes a difference, it was across the street from the very large Whirlpool Administration Building.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the first time I ever reported this, my family told me not to tell anyone, we live in a small town. :-)<n>

In North Platte, Nebraska the stars that can be seen in the nights sky are brillantly luminated.  Watching the sky counting the meteors and meteorites as they passed over our heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Meanwhile, my friends sister was just inside attending a birthday party at the skating ring, we were her escorts that for the night.  All of us are walking towards his house and, at the intersection of Custer Ave.and West 13th street, the background sky nearly Jet Black it was late in the evening shortly after 10: 00 PM which was nearly solid black and I&#39;m looking Northward up about 30 degree in the sky, when a massive Pitch Black rock shaped and jagged edges the size or mass of three football fields.  Directly, behind the leader in formation two seperate objects split apart about half the mass as the leader combined the same shape and color.   Another pair exactly the same just smaller than the first pair directly behind the first pair.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly, behide the last pair was a single object exactly the same as the others only smaller yet.  So they went from enormous leader the first to a pair that were exactly the same size objects too another pair exactly the same size each only smaller in size to the first pair.  The sixth object same shape and color just smaller than the second paired objects and directly behind and in the middle making up what would be the star of David formation.  However, it was solo and directly behind but in the center of the last pair.  The final object was out of formation and off and well behind the pack just smaller than all the rest of them.  It was like it struggled to keep up with the rest of the objects.  As these pitch black objects the shape of giant boulders with jagged edges raced across the night sky from North to South in my window of the sky view I shouted to my friend to look at these objects and pointed them out he could not see them because the were nearly the same color as the background sky,  If anyone including me would have blinked an eye you would have seen nothing, Moving extremely fast they were like a blurr only darkening out the stars as they passed over us like a shadow with pure silence.  Then, I took my eyes off the pack for just a second to aid him by pointing them out with my finger and in doing so I had difficulity trying to re-aquire the group because the speed was out of this world.  Finally, as I reaquired them on the flight path I was able to point them out again and he saw only a glimpse of a second or two before they vanished into a massive puffy white anvil or mushroom shaped clouds that were roughly one hundred fifty mile to the South at an altitude between 30,000 to 40,000 feet. They came out of the North on the same level flight path the moment I saw them dash  through my window of view.  I went home and told my parents what I saw and the were the least but interested because they were watching Ronald Reagan giving his exceptance speech for nomination of the Republican Party for President that Friday evening which is my Fathers birth date.  I highly doubt anyone would believe my story I was only fourteen  years old.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD))<n>

At first I thought it was exhaust from a plan, but as I looked closer, I saw that it was completely straight and appeared like it could be a floating cylinder in the sky, maybe about the length of 3 or 4 planes - hard to judge distance and actual size. I stared at it for about 2 or 3 minutes, when I realized I should run inside to grab my phone to take a picture, I usually have my phone on me at all times! 20 seconds later when I came back it was gone. I think it left cause it knew I was gonna take a picture! My first ufo sighting! I&#39;m excited.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

The driver noticed two red lights hoving about 200 feet off the ground. We stopped the car. We all got out to look at the lights. They where spaced apart mybe 1 to 2 hundred feet apart. Iits was so low that you could not see any thing but the two red light at the ends of the craft. After about a min. It started to move slowly to the right of us. When it moved away from the back round of the hill, you could see that it was a ufo. It banked slowly to the left and moved away very qiuckly. As it quickly flew a way. A bar code flash threw my head. I didnt take any mind to this at all being young. But it has repeatedly flashs threw my head. Another strange thing has happened to me when i was in my early years in school. Grade school that is. Living in the country i was all ways out side at night. One day in school, art class we where ask to draw some. I dont really rember what. But i ended up drawing this alien looking mans head. Egg shaped head, big slooping eyes. What i remember it looked pretty kool. Well be for the class was over. The teacher. came over and looked at it. Then some thing funny happened that has stuck with me for 35 years. He told me that he was going to a art show and he was going to take my picture of this alein that i had drawn. That seemed ok then. But as time went by i dont remember that he took any one else picture that day. Y would i remember this so long ago&gt;?<n>

I was with two friends sitting in a car and they saw it also.we looked at each other in disbelief &amp; said &#34;Did you see that?&#34;.it was almost as if our attention was drawn to it as soon as it appeared over the refinery.we were only 3-4 miles away from the object so it probably was about the size of a car. it just seemed like a very bright star. I would like to know if anyone else had seen this. I realize it is an old report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I looked up and to the right and saw 3 red lights flying overhead. The size was about 2-3 times the size of the stars. They flew to the left in a semi circle but not in any sort of formation. They drifted randomly amongst themselves/not too far from one another. As they circled left, I heard the hum of what seemed to be an engine or motor. I kept watching them and as the circle was about halfway complete they went up at the same speed. I kept watching, I was thinking to myself &#34;if these things dissappear, I&#39;m going to ((be very surprised))..&#34; and that&#39;s exactly what they did. My sister then came outside wondering why I was taking so long. To be honest, I never asked how long I was out there to know if it was longer than I recall.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was about 12 years old.  The image never left my mind... An oval shaped glowing object raced across the sky above us.  I didn&#39;t make any noise, it just flew east to west in the sky.  I was facing south when it happened.  The sky was clear that night and no clouds were present so it could not have been a reflection of light off anything.  I seen it plain and clear!!! A trail of light was behind it from probably traveling so fast!  It dissapeared into the night in about 2 seconds. It was probably 100ft up in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was cleaning swimming pool because our children would swim the next day. To clean the pool I used a long pole with an attached brush.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I moved my arm up the pole I turned my head to the rear and saw a craft headed in my direction at a low altitude and with lights on the front. What caught my attention was the width and pancake layout of the lights. As I stared at it for about 8-10 seconds, I realized it was not a helicopter (I have group propulsion systems background and aeronautical engineering studies). I ran toward the back patio door (about 20 feet away) and called to my wife and children to come out and see it. My wife was the only one who did. As I turned with her to look, the craft was now directly over our house and stationery. Perhaps, the swimming pool lights attracted it. It was about 75 feet above us for 40 seconds. It made no sound, had circular windows in the lower portion of the upper dome, it had no visible connections and appeared as it were one solid piece, the skin was metallic, silver and shiny.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We noticed a rectangular window about 8-10 feet long and 4 feet wide in the frontal leading edge but just beneath the front circular edge. There was an orange, redish light emanating from inside but could not see any occupants. The craft moved as if it were caught in a slight breeze but made no sound. It angled forward and downward for a few seconds. We could see rectangular shapes (2) that ran the diameter of the craft under the concave bottom. We also saw two ski like devices in the front lower side that seemed as hanging or docking devices rather than skis because they were to far in front of what I considered a center of gravity of the craft. The craft had a diameter of at least 75-100 feet with a height of at least a 1.5 story house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife kept repeating &#34;oh my god&#34; over and over again while I kept thinking take me with you! We decided not to discuss it but to draw what we each saw and then discuss it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this craft did not apply earthly technology. We will never forget the experience and continue to search the skies.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1980 is approximate.  Minor typos corrected at request of witness.

7/15/80 21:00|Conroe|TX|Light|3 to 4 Hours|A speeding craft and several lost hours|9/6/02|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24772.html|17|ndxe198007| A speeding craft and several lost hours<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time I worked as an Insurance/Anuity Sales Person. I lived in Dallas but was working on assignment in the Houston area. It was Thursday night around 8:00 to 9:00 pm and I was driving back to Dallas (home) on Interstate 45. I had just passed through Conroe going north when my Ford Pick-Up just quit running, at 70 mph all the idiot lights came on and that was it. I coasted as far as I could then finally stopped knowing that 2 associates of mine would be coming by momentarily on their way back to Dallas and I&#39;d be rescued. I turned the emergency flashers on and went back and lowered the tailgate of the truck to sit on while I watched for my associates. After 10 minutes or so I looked up and noticed for the first time how beautiful the stars were out in the country without all the city lights to block them from view. I kept looking up until my neck started to hurt and then I remembered a 4 ft section of plywood that I had laying down in the bed of the truck. I also had several cement blocks among the other junk that seemed to always occupy the truck bed. I quickly got up and arranged the blocks so that they were under the plywood, holding it up at about a 30 degree elevation so I could lay down to look at the stars and still see the oncoming traffic. I laid down and began looking up at the stars. I had been watching the sky for about 30-45 minutes when I first saw it. It (the object) was really nothing more than a very bright light that appeared to be 10 to 20,000 ft. up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing unusual, right? Nothing could be further from the truth. I watched this....<n> <n><n> <n><n> thing....for what seemed to be about 30 minutes or so and during that time it went across the sky in mere seconds.....it made right angle turns......it got bigger and brighter and then dim again, it crossed the sky once more from east to west then in mid-flight just seemed to disappear. I mean one second it was there, then the next second it was GONE! Now up until this point in my life I had not ever thought much about UFO&#39;s however I was beginning to re-evaluate my way of thinking. Anyway, with that over my attention now was re-directed to watching for my associates and getting rescued from my predicament. As I sat quietly and watched for my friends it became increasingly clear that there was far less traffic on this road than there should be at 10:00 pm at night on an Interstate Highway, 60 miles out of Houston. Up until this point it had not dawned on me to look at my watch since I knew roughly what time it was, but when I did look at my watch I got the shock of my life....IT WAS 1:45 AM. IT WAS ALMOST 4 HOURS LATER! Reality started to set in at this point.....I must have fallen asleep and missed my associates.....but I DID NOT FALL ASLEEP! I REMEMBER EVERY LAST DETAIL OF EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED. This missing time thing was real creepy but I had more important issues to deal with at the moment. I got on my CB radio and called out for anyone that could help. After 30 or 40 minutes of doing that, I got a response. It was a partially loaded Car Hauler and the driver said for 50 bucks he&#39;d take me and my truck all the way to Dallas. What GREAT luck! In an hour or so we were loaded and on our way to Dallas. When we got back to Dallas we unloaded the truck and I thanked the driver and went into my house. Several hours later I went out to check the truck for problems. I got in and turned the ignition and it started right up. I never found any problems with the truck and it never repeated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a few years later that I heard about abductees and all that. I mentioned this to an acquaintance at work and this guy looked at me like I was a fool. He told everyone at work about it and then I was &#34;BRANDED&#34; The resident UFO Nut! It wasn&#39;t long before I was forced to quit this job and go elsewhere for work. I never mentioned this again before now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After this incident, my life took a nosedive into the toilet. It was weird. It was like I had a big sign on me that said &#34;UFO Freak&#34;. I went from a 6 figure a year sales career in insurance to selling cars for a living. As incredible as this may sound, I lost my ability to sell that night. From 80 to zero literally &#34;Overnight&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I firmly believe that I was abducted that night. I don&#39;t remember any of it, but I know it happened....what else could explain the loss of time! If I ever find one of those people that can do hypnotic regression, I find out for sure. I hope that this is not too long but I know of no other way of explaining this to your readers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I remember it making some sort of headlines in a paper,but I didn&#39;t save it.Iam going to try to find it somewhere. after seeing something like that you never forget.

I had the apartment to myself for the entire summer and it was time well spent.  I loved the beach, the girls, etc. I have ALWAYS been a morning person and remain so to this day.  I&#39;ve never needed an alarm clock and rise most mornings before 5am.  I&#39;ve never been into alcohol or drugs of any kind.  In fact I love my lucidity and enjoy my conscious life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was wide awake that morning and could not wait to step out onto the terrace to look out over the entire Atlantic Ocean and feel the sweet breeze of freedom that was my youth.  I was smart enough to know how young and free I was because I knew one day I would be who I am today and how hard it is to make a living and meet one&#39;s responsibilities.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the Sun was rose to light the morning sky. a speeding craft came from way out in the ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew instantly this was something not of our experience.  This triangular object did in fact stop at the shoreline and hovered about 75 feet above my vantage point from the 17th floor terrace.  There were bright lights on each point of the triangle and it just hovered there for what seemed forever.  It hummed just enough that I could hear it over the sound of the waves beneath us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not afraid but felt glued to my fixed position as I gripped the rail of my Grandmother&#39;s balcony. What happened next remains forever in my head all these years because the craft turned on its right (my left) and sped off at such tremendous velocity and made a sound like a team of muffled Lions roaring in unison.  There was a faint liquid vapor trail and I could follow the craft with my eyes for the length of the coast until it then ascended into the clouds with a speed I can not comprehend or convey here.  This thing zipped away like nobody&#39;s business.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never forgot it all these years. ! I&#39;m fam iliar with Harrier Jump Jets and even witnessed Israeli fighter pilots doing manuevers over the Negev Desert when I lived in Israel.  I&#39;ve seen them turn on a dime during arial dogfighting manuevers.  I was even buzzed by Israeli warplanes while working the fields of a Kibbutz and I know what F-18&#39;s can do. You don&#39;t hear them until they are already gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing on this planet can do what I saw that day in 1980.  I&#39;ve never told anyone except my Mother and my Aunt.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I feel blessed to have witnessed something not from our imaginations but the reality of other life somewhere in the universe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What a gift.  My best to all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

It had lights around it and my uncle was quite concerned.  My uncle had been interested in airplanes and knew that it had not been normal.

They flew underwater in all directions, going up to the craft, and back down to the water again. I was never so scared in all my life! We even went to another beach a mile away and observed them there as well. My friend was more daring than me so she went for a closer look at the probes. She stated there were little &#34;creatures&#34; inside controling them!

The light was as bright as the stars, but the size, if I held a No. 2 pencil out, the size was the roundness of the eraser.  Measuring from where I was, it travelled a straight line about eight inches, and then stopped, and at an angle like a V, travelled another straight eight inches, and stopped, and a V again, travelled another eight inches, and then disappeared.  The pattern was a Z pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is it.  I can not identify it.  It was way to fast for a helicopter, Jet, or even a rocket.  Plus it stopped for an instant and changed directions.

I have never really believed in UFOs or anything of that nature. No Proof. What me and my fellow worker saw on a totaly bright, sunny afternoon in upstate New York, blew my mind! We have only mentioned it once to our co-workers (which was met with laughter) and to our own families (with raised eye brows from them).The two of us don&#39;t even mention it anymore to each other but it has bothered me for over 20 years. I&#39;ve been in the utility business now for over 30 years and have worked all kinds of hours day and night. I have never seen anything like what I am about to describe to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never wrote the date down but I think the month and year may be close. As we were driving south on Interstate Route 81 just about a half mile north of the Preble exit we both saw ,at the same time, A tremendously brilliant (chrome like/brilliant white) object with no decernable shape, possibly round about the size of a small car, slowly rise straight from the ground to a height of about two hundred feet, pause fo a second and then accelorate instantly at a slight angle from east to west over the southbound exit at Preble. It went from a DEAD STOP to instant acceleration. A BLUR in a fraction of a second. We could see the blur for about the first hundred feet or so. I know of nothing that could stand those forces. I was the passenger in the car and my buddy was the driver. We both looked at each other and I said to him &#34;did you see that?&#34; He said &#34; I didn&#39;t see anything like that&#34;, as if to say he wasn&#39;t going to repeat it. This was the middle of the day! Other people had to have seen it too. I still see the event clearly in my mind as if it were yesterday. I never said to anyone that it was a &#34;fling saucer&#34; or anything of that nature. I don&#39;t know what it was, but is WAS THERE. We both saw it and I&#39;ll swear to the Pope and to God himself what I just described to you. I&#39;m a very private person and I DO NOT want any press on this. I&#39;d tell them that I never saw it but someone should be investigating these things. Maybe it&#39;s some type of unknown geophysical event, I don&#39;t know but this traveled at various speeds and right angles. I&#39;m stumped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

However, despite being brief the sheer clarity of the sighting (my only one to date) has stuck with me, and I hope that it helps add another tiny piece of the UFO enigma.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was playing in the garden of my childhood home, which was no more than a mile from one of the largest military bases in the UK, and less than ten miles from both the defence research establishment and Farnborough airport, home of the UK&#39;s most famous air show.  As a result I grew up seeing low flying aircraft ranging from Westland Wessex helicopters doing search and rescue exercises over Brookwood Cemetary (which was at the bottom of my garden) to jets flying almost at roof level, weird experimental craft being displayed and tested out of Farnborough, and commercial traffic from the nearby Heathrow and Gatwick international airports, and Fairoaks aerodrome.  Like all boys of the time, I had a keen interest in all things military, and became quite the expert at aircraft identification.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event occurred at around 2-3pm on a Sunday in early June of 1980 (the date I quoted is my best guess).  Despite being located between a road and railway track, being a Sunday it was extremely quiet, and one of those rare halcyon British summer&#39;s days when there was not one single whisp of cloud in the sky - nor were there any contrails in evidence.  For some reason I felt compelled to look up - there was no sound, but maybe it was just a serendipitous urge - and saw a clearly defined silver egg shaped craft travelling at no more than 100-200 knots in a north to south direction at an altitude of around 500-1000&#39;.  My estimate of size was in the order of a VW Transporter (bug bus) at most, a VW Beetle at the least.  Given my position, I had less than a minute to observe it before is disappeared over the tree line, BT in that time made a couple of key observations:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1/  The craft was totally silent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2/  The surface of the object was perfectly smooth.  Whilst we have made numerous aircraft with a refelctive polished aluminium outer skin, it&#39;s never perfectly smooth - there are always small imperfections around rivets, obvious seams, and ripples in the surface where it has been worked.  This object was like a drop of mercury, and reflected the ground beneath it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3/  The craft did not at any time change direction, altitude, or speed as far as I could ascertain.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5/ for me, the most startling aspect was that as it passed almost directly overhead, I felt a very hard to describe sensation. At this stage I had no concept of this object was, so I felt no fear, yet I became aware of a sort of shiver that went through me, and that my hair seemed to stand up. It only lasted as long as the craft was overhead, and faded in and then out as it passed. My description sounds fairly prosaic, but I can assure you that ive never felt anything quite like it before or since; I just can&#39;t quite find the words to adequately describe it. There maybe some parallels to the way in which you feel infrasound rather than hear it - as if the signal hits you on a cellular level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4/  The craft was flying into the wind, which was very very light anyway.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As an aside, when I was totally clear in my own mind that what I had seen could not be explained by anything I&#39;d seen before, I rushed into the house in order to tell  my mother what I&#39;d seen.  &#34;It was probably Telstar,&#34; she informed me dismissively, and that explanaition sufficed for a while until my teacher, to whom I later recounted the sighting, told me that satellites orbit WAY higher than what I&#39;d seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve never seen a ghost, have seen the Surrey Puma (our local anomalous big cat), and never seen anything else in the sky I couldn&#39;t rationalise.  However, this event has stuck with me for over thirty years, and rarely go more than a few weeks without it popping into my head.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the record, I&#39;m now a professional photojournalist, and have even leant my talents in image analysis to various publications and groups in respect of various paranormal subjects.  I&#39;m also not prone to flights of fantasy, and have an IQ which would put me in the genius category.<n>
7/8/80 04:00|Louisville|KY|Cigar|30 Minutes|DEFINITELY NOT FROM AROUND HERE!|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44038.html|29|ndxe198007| DEFINITELY NOT FROM AROUND HERE!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was taking a girlfriend of mine home. We live in Louisville, KY. She had recently moved way out by a Ford plant, on Westport Road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time (1980) the roads were very winding and the whole area wasn&#39;t that developed. There were those huge power lines everywhere on the side of the road like you see in such rural areas. We were both 21 years old, and we had been up late because she wanted to discuss some troubling family issues that had just ocurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took her home and from my house (in Fern Creek)it was a very long way out there. I then drove back the same road and was moving right along in my Mustang when I got to a winding part of the road, and slowed for safety sake.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly I saw a craft that was similar in body perhaps to a helicopter, in that it was long and may have been wider at the front than the rear. I only noticed it had a high beam light on me. I knew it could very possibly be a police helicopter, and figured it was just what it was. It kept putting the beam on me and scared me. I was afraid maybe they were looking for some escaped criminal or something and may have thought I fit their description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I saw that the craft though was so low to the ground that it was amazing. I suddenly thought that if it was that low, which was at the first draping power line of the two, that it may get tangled into them and then I&#39;d be affected by the mess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was scared that it would cause an accident, so I stopped the car and watched it. It was hovering perfectly still in the air, but was that low, and had NO SOUND AT ALL. I even rolled down the window a bit because I thought maybe they would come on a bull horn or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All the time I couldn&#39;t see much of the thing because of this beam directed at me. It didn&#39;t get entangled, though that close to the lines, and I figured before it did, I&#39;d race ahead and get out of there and did so. Strangely, it went up into the sky then but again, not all that high in altitude.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I went all the way home, maybe 30 miles, and it had followed me every inch of the way, sometimes higher up in the sky, others lower, and I was horrified maybe it WAS the police. Then I got home, and parked in our back driveway and saw it flying in the sky slowly, in both directions, no pattern. I thought that was very weird, and it seemed it had followed me so long and far, that I ran into our house. I have always thought it was a UFO though I didn&#39;t ever know if I did or did not believe in them and still don&#39;t know for sure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But when I think back on that night, I picture driving and where it was I saw it so close to those power lines, and suddenly I realize I&#39;m recalling the right spot I was driving, but in the wrong direction. I was going homeward on that particular curve, and yet I always recall it as if going toward her apartment instead. That is very weird to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft had been pretty low when I pulled into the driveway and I watched it after turning out the car lights. Suddenly it zipped up into the sky above my backyard so fast it was a mere speck. THAT is when I didn&#39;t think it was a police helicopter and the other reason was that a chopper always makes some big propeller sound, but even close to me as it was on that road by the power lines, it was SILENT.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also later heard others say that weird sitings happened around POWER LINES and wonder if they someway tap into the power or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a professional person and college educated, reasonable and have never taken one drug in my life. It was definitely NOT from around here..<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports from the same source.  We have posted both reports.  PD))<n>

Now I&#39;m 46. I have told close friends of this, and they know I&#39;ve never taken one drug in my life or even smoked a normal cigarette! I was taking my friend home way out Westport Road. At that time, it was different, undeveloped except for a huge Ford Truck Plant and some apartments.  All along the way it was just land, with huge power lines on tall poles draping over a fairly twisty road in places.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After taking her home, in my Mustang, I noticed what I believed to be a normal helicopter coming down...down...then it got so darned near to those big power lines that it scared me! I didn&#39;t want its propellers (though I saw none) get twisted into those lines, so I stopped immediately. I wasn&#39;t going that fast since the road twisted into a sort of curve there anyway, with a guardrail there, and power lines above. No lights were there, only my car lights so it was pitch black otherwise, out in the country. It came so low near my car I wondered if it was a police helicopter looking for someone...I had stopped so I rolled down my windows and turned off my air conditioner. I could not hear it and it was BELOW the second draping power line. That is too low for any craft to be near a street, so I thought it was dangerous. Then it darted back up--way up in seconds. It was unreal how fast. The thing was cigar shaped in that it was similar to a plane or a helicopter body but it was lit up and also shone a light down on the ground. It wasn&#39;t directly on me but near me. I thought a Police &#39;copter made a mistake and was looking for someone but when I heard no engines or whirring propellers it was mysterious to me. I wasn&#39;t even thinking of UFO&#39;s! I went home and followedit in the sky with my eyes and it began to come nearer and then go out higher, irratic for a plane and a &#39;copter can&#39;t go that high I don&#39;t think! I went home (35 minutes trip) and it followed me all the way home, till I got into the driveway. At one point in the road where they are a crossroads, I actually turned out my lights and then went up the hill and thought they lost me but they just went up high. When I got to my yard and parked my car, I stayed in the dark car a minute looking up in the sky as it &#34;looked&#34; for me. While it was up in the air a minute I ran into the house and told my mother who said it was probably a helicopter looking for someone. I said it was so strange it would follow me that long. All night I had this dream I couldn&#39;t stand where I was &#34;downloading&#34; all this &#39;simple&#39; information like: what was my weight? Height? Size? Who were (names!) all of my relatives, what was my education, religion, heritage, you name it. This was before computers and stuff, and the only way to this day I can describe it is like in my dream my whole &#39;data&#39; was downloaded. Maybe the whole thing just gave me this dream, yet in the dream it was very annoying to answer all these simple questions so painstakingly for what seemed hours. I&#39;ve never seen anything weird before or since. I have never smoked, drank anything but an occasional drink because I don&#39;t even like it, and wasn&#39;t on any medicine, didn&#39;t need to be, was perfectly healthy and happy and normal.I have never taken ANY illegal drugs either. I know what I saw wasn&#39;t normal. One other funny thing is that to this day, twenty years later, when I think back on it, I picture myself going TO my friends apartment, yet it was that stretch of road coming BACK that I saw it....weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous; indicates that date of incident is approximate.

She was taking a long time getting ready to go out for the evening so I went outside and laid on the hood of my 1970 Mercury Montego looking up at the evening sky.  There were some stars out, but not excessive.  After awhile I saw what I thought was a shooting star.  The star, however, stopped amazingly suddenly.  I figured that the actual shooting star must have disappeared behind a nighttime cloud and I must be focusing on a different star.  I kept my eye on it anyway.  It quickly became apparent that the star I was focusing on was something strange.  It was gyrating back and forth fairly rapidly.  After approx. 10-15 seconds of gyration the &#34;star&#34; shot across the sky just like a shooting star.  As a matter of fact, it looked no different.  It was too high up for me to make out any particular shape.  It was a white light just like all of the other stars.  I was sort of blown away but then I figured I must be tired and imagined what I saw.  Although I knew what I saw, I could not admit it to myself.  If made me sit upright on the hood.  I was going to get up to go tell my girlfriend what I saw when suddenly another shooting star raced across the night time sky just as the first one and stopped in the EXACT SAME PLACE!  Now I knew I was really seeing something very weird.  It also started gyrating, and traveled in a perfect little triangle pattern, stopped for a minute, gyrated, and took off in the same projectile direction as the first, looking just like a shooting star.  One again, I was about to run into the house to tell my girlfriend what I was witnessing.  The adrenaline was flowing and my heart was pounding.  A third came out of the night sky, stopped in the same place, raced around in a circle (not a triangle) and split really fast just like the first two.  I did not wait around to see it there were any more.  Now I wish I did.  I ran into the house and yelled to my girlfriend, Where is a phone book?  I need to call the Hudson police department.  She sort of freaked out and yelled, what&#39;s wrong!!?  Still in the shower, she could not come down.  I saw one of those emergency stickers on the side of her phone and called the Hudson police dept., hear pounding out of my chest.  When someone answered and asked if it was an emergency, I got a grip.  I realized that I cannot embarrass myself by reporting UFO sightings.  That would be absurd.  I hung up.  I never reported it.  My girlfriend politely acknowledged what I saw, but I think that was the beginning of the end. Looking through her eyes, I think she thought I was nuts.  This was either on a Friday night or a Saturday night.  When I got to work on Monday I could not help but to confide in a coworker and tell him my story.  He laughed and said, your full of shit, you read the paper.  I asked him what he was talking about.  He said that there were several UFO sightings reported over the weekend in NH.  None were reported in Massachusetts according to my coworker.  The only one I remember him describing to me was a low down light in a field in NH and other low altitude sightings?  It did not sound like what I saw but the same weekend, never the less.  I tried, tonight, 23 years later, to try to substantiate this to my wife by Google&#39;ing a search for New England UFO sightings hoping to find a newspaper article.  I did find this:  7/7/81 Pittsfield Darryl S. Perrault, 18, Carl E. Perrault, his father, and Ann Delsignore, his girlfriend, saw a UFO through binoculars for 45 minutes. When first seen, it shot across the sky like a meteor, then suddenly stopped. Darryl said, &#34;It was oval-shaped, with red and white flashing lights around the outside like a ring. No way it was a plane or a sattelite- it shot across the sky too fast.&#34; N.E. UFO Newsletter #23 Oct. 1981 p. 18  Seems pretty darn similar.  My search was prompted because myself, my wife and my two daughters watched a UFO special on TV and my wife said, girls, don&#39;t believe any of this crap.  I of course encouraged them to keep an open mind.  I am a college educated individual who had nothing to gain by making up a story.  I am speaking the absolute truth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

My older brother and I were playing in the backyard.  It was dark outside and it must have been close to time for us to go in.  I remember seeing this this flying just over the trees, maybe 30 ft from the ground and directly over our heads.  I didnt see the top of it, cause it was right over my head, but I did see that it was circular from the bottm, so I assume it was a disk.  On the bottom of this craft, was 4 large domes.  The domes were glowing a milky white color.  The craft was about 25 ft. in diameter and the only saound this thing made, was a humming noise, like bass on a stereo.  My brother was screaming&#34;go away,go away&#34;!!!  I felt differently about it, I remember feeling playful and was a yelling&#34; come down, come down&#34;!!!  The craft continued moving very slowly over the house and out of view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s been a very long time since this happened, but it will stay in my mind for the rest of my life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Thousands of people were watching fireworks in the bleachers and parked out in the fields in our cars.  I was with my X husband.  I was laying on the hood, my back against the windshield.  (No alcohol was involved)  We were all watching fireworks when I noticed the sky coming down, closer.  When I realized something was happening I couldn’t move.  I realized it was a HUGE ufo that was passing slowly east to west.  It was so low you could see how it was riveted together, the seams of the craft and all the lighting. It made no sound.  I was scared to death and finally leaned to the right and fell off the car. I wanted to hide under the car.  I could only get near the tire.  I wanted to scream but couldn’t.  I realized I was not suppose to remember this happening.  I kept telling myself I will remember, I will remember.  The craft size was huge, bigger than the fairgrounds bleacher area where they hold concerts! and races.  It started to rise up while heading west.  After a period of time I heard a launch of a fire work, then slowly another.  Little by little people started moving, and talking (oohs and aaahs)  I was able to slowly get up and I asked my X if he remembered it.  He said yes, but acted like he was in a trance.  We went home, I insisted and we each drew pictures of the object that matched.  For years when I would mention this story I knew deep down I wasn’t suppose to talk about.  I know I am not suppose to remember this.  But I do.  It is simple I know what I know.  I expected it to be on the news and in the paper.  Nothing!  I would have thought it would have showed up on radar or something. For years I have wondered if someone who was there just like me remembers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For years I have just said I know what I know.  I don’t care who believes it I just know.<n>

I&#39;m fully panicked and struggle to get up but can&#39;t move. The sun is coming in the window and i can distinguish this from any dream state. I lay my head back down to get the umph to get myself up, and when i&#39;m able to, he&#39;s gone. I had a vague impression sperm  had been taken. The greys are dime-a-dozen and i am very interested in being contacted by people w/ experiences or information about these little blue guys.

We witnessed about 10 satellites, 10 shooting stars and something even more amazing…<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a half hr up on the rock, I noticed a huge ball of fire about 100 metres to the left of us, which was about 100 metres over the top of the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I started to scream and we were all in awe at what we were witnessing.  It was a round fire ball about 40 feet wide with a tail of fire following it.  It was travelling about 20 kms an hour and crossed Muldrew Lake within about a minute or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it reached the opposite side of the lake it disappeared behind the tree line and headed towards Loon/Turtle Lakes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We yelled at mom to come up and see it, but she had no idea what we were yelling about as she was watching tv downstairs...<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so intrigued to know what this was as it was obviously under control and I thought it might be a satellite of some sort that caught on fire as it entered the atmosphere, and then somehow headed in its bizarre trajectory.  Mom and dad listened to the radio that night and had heard that it might be a Russian rocket, so we left it at that..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also recall vividly a week later that mom had called our friend who was on the next lake over to see if she had seen it as well.  Sure enough she had.  She was in the park in Gravenhurst with a bunch of people for a concert and she was the one to yell out, &#34;What is that?&#34;  She described the exact same thing we saw…a round ball of fire with a fire tail flowing from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would love to know if this was a satellite or not.  How can I find out what it was?<n>

It was late and already completely dark. It was in a street with very few streetlights, a lot of trees and almost no houses, so there wasn&#39;t a lot of light pollution. At a certain moment we all looked up at the same time and saw a big black object obscuring the stars in the sky not very high above us. It is difficult to tell the height, but it was maybe 300 feet or so. It moved very slowly over us and was covered by lights of all colors, which strangely enough didn&#39;t illuminate the object. The object was too low and too slow to be able to be a plane or helicopter. We heard no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1980 is approximate.

I would have been about 12 years old at the time.  It was not long after dark.  Weather was warm with clear skies.  I was in the family room of my parent&#39;s house, looking out a large picture window.  Windows on both sides of the picture window were open to let in an evening breeze.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Directly in front of me above the trees across the street, a large circular UFO flew directly towards my parent&#39;s house.  The craft was darker than the night sky and could be seen as a circle.  The outer circumference of the craft had multi-colored lights all the way around.  Either the craft was rotating as it moved forward or the lights were changing color in a way that mimicked rotation.  The craft moved somewhat slower than I would have expected for low-flying light aircraft.  The craft&#39;s altitude appeared to be below 500 feet.  I estimate the craft was 60 to 100 feet across.  I never heard the craft make a sound.  As it passed above my parent&#39;s house, I ran to the front door and out into the front yard.  I again briefly saw the craft as it went over the treeline behind my parent&#39;s house.  The light pattern on the craft was very similar to another UFO report I found here, except the lights I saw formed a complete circle around the outer edge of the craft:<n> <n><n> <n><n> http://www.ufocasebook.com/i84encounter.html.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The object was moving very slowly across the sky, travelling approximately from the north to the south, and in a path that was almost over my street.  I was amazed that it was completely silent.  It&#39;s difficult to guess how big the object was or how high, but I would estimate it was about a hundred feet up and maybe 25-50 feet long.  When the object was almost directly overhead, I thought to run back into the house to get my telescope.  When I returned, the object was still moving slowly in the same direction, but was nearing the crest of the hill beside my house.  Before I could find it in the telescope it had disappeared over the hill.  Since it was so long ago, I don&#39;t remember the exact date or even the correct year, but the details of the sighting are still vivid in my mind.  Maybe there were other similar sightings that would help place the exact date.<n>

It was so long ago.  I wanted to report it after seeing that others have reported seeing UFO&#39;s in the same area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the summer of 1980, I came out of the grocery store with the bag boy and noticed something in the sky.  It was approaching sunset and I could see an bright shining object in the sky.  I knew it was not a star because it moved. I asked the bag boy what the object was and he was clueless as well.  I drove home looking at the object, not wanting to lose track of it.  I went home and asked my father, who worked as a nuclear physicist at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories what the object was. I figured he would know since he has put satellites up in space.  He told me it was a weather ballon or a slow moving plane and went back to work in his den.  About 45 minutes later, I advised my father that the object was still in the sky and that it was beginning to move around.  My father turned white as a ghost and came running out to see the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We lived on farm land in a newly developed houses.  Our backyard view was a large field and Altamont Pass (mountains) with Mount Diablo in the distance. So we had a great view of what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, my entire family came outside to watch the object in the sky and then the neighbors on both sides of our home came outside to see as well.  This was around 8:00 p.m. in the evening.  The objects danced around in the sky and darted here and there.  I ran into the house to get my father&#39;s binoculars.  The object was triangular (almost like the letter &#34;A&#34;) shape with lights on all three points.  A few hours later the objects flew in the direction of Mount Diablo (Mount of the Devil, as the Indians called it.. a coincidence?  I don&#39;t think so) and disappeared behind it or on it? That night on channel 7 (newscene S.F.) a reporter named Van Amburg presented a story about an object in the sky.  It was a short uneventful segment about what people reported seeing, however, nothing was ever mentioned about it again on the news.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, every night... I mean, every night around 1 or 2 in the morning I would wake up not knowing why.  I would look out my window and it was there.  It was like it knew I was there watching it.  I watched it for a while and then it would fly away over Mount Diablo.  This happened every night.  I told my mother on occasion, but no one ever thought it was that important. I don&#39;t remember if it ever stopped or if I just forgot about it as I turned 18 years old and moved out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To hear others talk about this area freaked me out and I had to share my story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know what that object was but let me put it this way.  Even though I believe in God, I didn&#39;t believe that ghosts appeared in the daytime.... till I moved to Hawaii.  I didn&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s until the summer of 1980, but now I do.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

They appeared to be about 500 to maybe 700 feet above me and and appeared fairly large.
