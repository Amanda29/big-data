They seemed to keep pace with my vehicle until I left the area.  The night was cloudy and they seemed to be above the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought they were searchlights in the sky but realized they were independent lights unto themselves.  How they could escape radar is beyond me as they were very close to the airport.  It seemed like a game to them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No person could survive being in these craft as the &#34;G&#34; forces would be tremendous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Strangest thing I have ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I observed it for a couple of minutes before it went beyond the tree line.  Its motion was very fluid and it changed directions frequently and quickly.  It would blink very rapidly and alternately vanish/go dark for brief periods over and over.<n>
2/28/14 22:30|Imperial|MO|Other|10 minutes|Bright orange lights flying a North/West direction, large groups at first then one at a time.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107545.html|4|ndxe201402| Bright orange lights flying a North/West direction, large groups at first then one at a time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was going out to my car, and noticed bright lights in the sky. I first thought they were stars.  Then I noticed they were moving quickly heading North/West.  They looked like large bright orange lights.  They were in large groups at first, then the groups started to get smaller. I grabbed my cell phone and took a short minute and a half video.  Then I woke my wife to show her.  We watched for a few minutes until they started coming one at a time.  They all followed the same course except the very last one.  The last one looked like it was off course, or separated from the others.  Then all of the sudden, the very last one just disappeared.  Then about 5 minutes later, a helicopter flew the exact path they did, but in a South/East direction.<n>
2/28/14 22:00|Gorham|ME|Triangle|10 minutes|Three separate objects proceeding one by one towards the same direction.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107535.html|5|ndxe201402| Three separate objects proceeding one by one towards the same direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 10pm on Friday, February 28, 2014 my wife and I saw unexplainable lights in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife alerted me to a strange light outside of our South-facing bedroom window that she said she had seen hovering for a few seconds, then slowly move West (to the right) and suddenly turn North East (tracking left).  I turned to the window and saw the object.  It was moving North East over Buxton.  It appeared to have a triangular shape with white and red lights, none of which were blinking.  It was very low in the sky, sometimes obscured by the trees even when looking from a high second story window.  We followed it from window to window and lost it behind the trees heading towards the direction of North Gorham or Windham.  It appeared to be either very close or very large.  It did not follow any route that I’ve seen other air traffic follow here.  A very soft rumble was audible, but I am not sure if it was emanating from the object.  Our observation of this object lasted about a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched the first object, I spotted a second object moving in an irregular manner.  It appeared more distant, or smaller; it was just a spot in the sky.  It too was very low in the sky, peeking out from behind the trees.  We watched it appear to ascend behind the trees to the South East towards Scarborough.  As it very slowly ascended, it meandered back and forth to the left and right before it began to accelerate towards the left – Northward, in the direction that the first object had been going.  It very quickly reached what appeared to be a much higher speed than the prior object while still appearing to be very far away.  No shape or sound was discernible, but it the light appeared again to have white and red colors.  It disappeared behind the trees.  Total observation time of this object was under a minute.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After standing there for several minutes looking to see if anything else would appear, we returned to the bedroom from the other side of the house.  Glancing out of the South-facing window, we again saw an object almost identical to the first and following a similar path.  This time, however, it was even nearer and one of the white lights was flashing.  It also moved more quickly than the first, or perhaps it just appeared to move more quickly because it was closer.  We followed it back around to the other side of the house again and watched it disappear in the same direction as had the first two objects.  No sound was audible this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’ve never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was small but looked to be just above the tree line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first we noticed it moving parallel to the ground for a split second but then almost immediately shot straight down on a 90 degree angle.  When it shot down it moved very quickly but not at the same rate, slowing down and speeding up, but all within about 2 seconds time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am describing this as a fireball since it had a small tail on the end when it shot down.  This could not have been a meteor since it was no more then 50 feet off the ground and the way in which it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was several hours into the darkness (February).  Our view was mostly northern somewhat northeastern horizon in the windshield view, at that point on I-70.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First we saw a bright, round light, like a large star, come from upper view, downward, traveling very slowly, it seemed. We both declared it to be a &#34;falling star&#34;.  It stayed constant in shape and size and dropped straight down into the horizon in front of us disappearing just above the visible land horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If the meteor made it through the atmosphere, we guess that remnants would have landed in very northern PA, NY or Canada.  I wonder what they saw from their view.<n>
2/28/14 20:35|Evansville|IN|Circle|4 minutes|Three orange lights make a triangle over east side of Evansville, IN.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107633.html|10|ndxe201402| Three orange lights make a triangle over east side of Evansville, IN.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father and I were coming home from him picking me up from work.  We pulled into our driveway when I looked over the slant of my rooftop.  In the sky there was a weird triangle.  It wasn&#39;t a full triangle, but on each of the three points there was an orange/red/amber light. It seemed to keep a perfect triangular shape.  I was losing my mind while my dad told me to stay in the car.  Immediately, he does the most stereotypical thing and pulls out his phone.  He starts to record it but forgets to press the actual record button, of course.  I was on the verge of tears because I did not know what was going on.  The triangle moves to the left in the sky and the top point and bottom left point start to move straight out to the left while the right one stays.  The two immediately make a curved path and disappear into the clouds.  The third one stays behind a little and then after about a minute starts to float away.  We waited a few more minutes to see what else would happen but nothing did. We knew that it wasn&#39;t a plane, helicopter, or drone.  This was something unreal it seemed.  We thought we were crazy but we knew what had happened even if our minds didn&#39;t want to believe it.<n>

They looked bright red orange and were pretty big.  They were not airplanes or helicopters.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first they were stationary then they started to move in a trianular pattern.  Behind it to the right there were several more.  They appeared very close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I panicked and ran to get into my house with my toddler.  My husband watched them and said they went straight up and faded out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Does anyone know if this is a US Military Project?  It is too scary to think otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought I could handle extraterrestrial contact but apparently I cannot.  I was too scared and was immediately panicked about the safety of my children.<n>

While I&#39;m the only person reporting the event, I expect everyone else in that traffic would have seen it as well, numbering in the hundreds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two white lights, spaced roughly 10 feet apart, hovering motionless 100 feet over the north bound road.  As I approach any light in the sky I always attempt to identify any blinking lights as are required by the FAA.  This had none.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was dark outside but the clouds in the landscape were lit slightly by the city below and through the two lights in the sky I could see the clouds.  I saw no craft supporting the lights. I looked for it through my rear view upon moving further down the interstate, but the lights had vanished by then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When you called me, I was a bit unclear on the exact location, and I&#39;m sorry for that.  I&#39;ve since gone back down the interstate and identified a landmark beside which I saw the lights.<n>

It looked similar to a shooting star but did not seem quite as fast and was moving upward.  It blinked out just below the left star of Orion&#39;s belt and I didn&#39;t see anything further.<n>

The shape was round and a bright light it was hovering for one moment and than just shot across the sky and appeared to be moving straight and then downward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As quick as it appeared out of no where is as quick as it disappeared.  It did NOT have a trail of light behind it there was nothing behind it, it was just a light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It traveled about as far as I can open my arms about a 90 degree STRAIGHT angle straight across the sky then appeared to go downward and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can not believe what I witnessed last night.<n>

It was difficult to tell how high the object was, because there were no lights on it to help judge the distance but I would guess relatively low due to the fact that it was about 1/8 to 1/5 the size of a full moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no sound and it was traveling east south east toward the center of Chattanooga.  I observed the object for about 12 seconds or so as it flew out of sight remaining the same speed and direction the entire time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve always been interested in looking up at the stars and own a telescope.  I have never seen anything like this before.  Since it had NO lights on it, it appeared a dark gray over the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I strained to get as clear of view as possible and could not make out any form of a plane or bird.  It definitely had a triangle shape.<n>

2/27/14 19:30|Butler|IN|Unknown|3-5 minutes|Two close lights, first dim and second twice as bright with occaisional flare up, non-blinking.|3/18/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107517.html|29|ndxe201402| Two close lights, first dim and second twice as bright with occaisional flare up, non-blinking.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On February 27th, 2014, at approximately 1930-1935hrs, I Mr. ((initial deleted)) and Ms. ((initial deleted)) observed two lights moving across the dusk sky heading in a northeastern direction.  We both had just arrived home and I was making an observation of the how there were multiple chem-trails in the evening sky that were going east to west.  This is not uncommon as we live in the north eastern part of Indiana and it’s a common occurrence, I believe we are on an air-route for Detroit, thus explaining the high volume of airplanes.  As we were searching the entire night sky I first observed the lights coming from the southwest and heading towards the northeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What caused me to question these lights was the fact that they were moving across the sky in tandem, staying in what seemed a constant spacing and being in close proximity to each other.  I held my hand up and would estimate that they were two inches apart.  If the sky line is 180 degrees, we first saw them at about 120-130 degrees and finally lost sight of them at approximately 20-30 degrees.  My observations lasted between 3-5 minutes until I lost sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also the other strange observation that I witnessed was the fact that the two lights were not blinking as compared to all of the other 5-7 planes that were blinking in the night sky.  The first of the two lights was dim and the second light was twice as bright.  The second light also would flare up very bright, every 20 seconds or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for your time.

There were some stars also visible at the time, but they were much dimmer.  The two bright lights looked more like planets than stars.  They were at approximately a 35-40 degree angle from the ground.  As I continued look at the lights for 10-15 seconds, they did not move, flicker, flash, or change in any way.  They then faded away and were completely gone within 5 seconds.

Our home is 3 houses from the end of the street and the Chesapeake Bay is at the end of the street.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got out of bed and looked out the window to see if someone was in our driveway.  The bedroom is on the front of the house on the 2nd floor.  No one was in the driveway though.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then I opened the door which leads to the porch upstairs, which is off of my bedroom, to see if anyone was in the driveway next door, no one was there either.  I turned my head to look across the street and I saw an object.  It was between and behind my neighbors’ houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared round because there were a lot of individual round lights that were so bright that when you looked at them, you saw a circle.  The object moved then a few yards to the end of the street and above the Chesapeake Bay.  It just hovered there making no sound at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I kept staring at the object trying to figure out what it was, I could see, only for a few seconds, what appeared to be something in the center of the bright lights.  It appeared to go straight across in the middle of all the lights.  It had a curved, rectangle shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then moved quickly to the right, which put it either in front of the homes on the street that runs parallel to the Bay, or the object went further out over the Bay.  I could not see it at this point.  I have never seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object did not make any sound at all.  It consisted of many round lights that were so bright.  Each light was round and they filled the circle from the middle to the edge.   When you looked at all the lights, they made a circle shape.<n>

Two lights and one in the middle flashing.  It moved slow, no rash movements.  But what triggered me to send this report is that the light sequence changed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few seconds all three lights were on parallel to each other, then only one was on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then finally the lights reappeared and changed into a triangle pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have over 6 years experience in the US ARMY.  I didn&#39;t think too much of it until I looked carefully at it and notice the light sequence.  I think it was a human aircraft, however it seemed as if this aircraft was communicating visually with another aircraft that was not seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was little to no sound.<n>

Above the First National Bank building something caught my eye.  There are several towers from the energy industry around but they are predominantly stationary and more to the far left of my window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought the object was weird because it did not have the appropriate lights for an airplane or helicopter.  As I peered closer, I saw it was a diamond shaped craft, with an undulating pulse of green, red and blue lights.  It moved slowly in a circular motion but for the most part just hovered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning, I double checked to make sure they didn&#39;t just put another tower up and beheld that above the bank building and in the distance, there are no towers viewable.<n>

It zipped by at a fast speed, then slowly did a ‘figure eight.’  It would then stay put for a few seconds before slowly hovering, sometimes in a straight line, and other times in odd directions.  It was still there when I decided to go inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This my fourth sighting of this same phenomena.  They date back to the summer of 2009. The sightings are always in the same spot in the sky (from my vantage point), and on at least one other occasion, there were several of these same orbs, floating together--the most I’ve ever seen were four orbs at a time.  During two of these sightings, the orbs disappeared and reappeared in unison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At a glance, this orb could easily pass for a very bright star, but if observed for more than five seconds, it is plain to see that it is definitely not a star.  It is the same color as the sun, dims and brightens in a pulsating fashion, and moves in odd ways.<n>

I was driving home with my three year old son and eight year old daughter.  On the right side of the sky, I seen a vertical curved strip of 5 orange lights distantly in the sky.  They stayed on for about 2 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then on the other side of the sky I seen another vertical strip of 5 orange lights curved towards where the other lights were, light up.  Both sets of lights were the exact same distance away, they did not flicker or change their position.  They were a mirror image of each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My eight year old daughter asked me what they were.  I had no idea what to tell her.  The second set then went out and the first set came back on, then that one went out and the second one came back on for about 2 seconds, then went back out again.  Each time they lit up they never stayed lit for more than 10 seconds each time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pulled over turned on my flashers and watched and waited. There was no sound associated with these lights, a! nd the road was unnaturally empty of traffic and people, even considering the time of day.  Nothing happened, so I pulled back out behind the first vehicle I&#39;d seen sense I pulled onto the road, a truck, and continued to drive.  Less than an eighth of a mile down the road the first set came back on again, same location, same distance for about five seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The truck in front of me slowed to almost a stop and I knew that they had seen it too.  The truck then turned on its flashers drove slightly down the road some more at a slow pace, then pulled into a small closed restaurant and just sat there.  I drove by the truck slowly and the man had his head sticking out of his window watching the sky.  That was the last time the lights lit up and I continued to drive home stunned by what I had seen.  I have never seen anything I could remotely come close to calling a UFO, but I have no explanation for what I seen that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My three year old still talks about the lights in the sky and my eight year old fully believes that she saw angels that night.<n>

Often there are two or three different objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On multiple occasions I&#39;ve sat with others and had them witness the bright yellow lights themselves, but never had it come this close to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Today&#39;s:  Glowing yellow light coming from the South West Didn&#39;t seem to be heading toward me at first, but began to do so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From afar appeared yellow, with small green light glowing behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Seemed to move upward first, before approaching.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it approached it sounded like a quiet plane, and it became more apparent.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flew directly overhead, very slowly.  Looked to be only a few hundred feet up. Couldn&#39;t quite make out a shape, but it appeared to be oval.  From directly below it, it had three bright yellow lights in a triangular form, but clearly separate lights.  There were also green and red lights on either side, one or two on each side.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it was closer by, it sounded as though it emitted more of a whooping sound, with sort of a droning low tone, as though it was hovering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Considered it to be a plane, but there aren&#39;t any prominent airports south west of here (that I know of)  Even had their been, there would be no reason for a plane to be low-down in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sort of hovered across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I said, it&#39;s path brought it almost directly over my house, and it was low down enough to note that it was slightly off to the side, rather than directly above me.<n>

2/25/14 20:35|Firebaugh (near)|CA|Formation|~2 minutes|Formation or cluster of five lights catapulting and zooming dramatically near the I-5 freeway at night.|3/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/108/S108029.html|65|ndxe201402| Formation or cluster of five lights catapulting and zooming dramatically near the I-5 freeway at night<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving rapidly north on US Interstate 5 (I-5) shortly after dark, about 15 miles west of Firebaugh, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Ahead of me (a hundred meters perhaps) I saw a cluster of five lights in several indeterminate/shifting colors moving rapidly from east to west about 10 meters above the freeway, in a downward trajectory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then as my car reached the place where the lights were coming down, I slowed down, and observed through the driver&#39;s side window as the lights seemed to fold into themselves and lift up again abruptly into the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked back at the car&#39;s outside side-mirror and saw the lights continue to ascend behind me in the far distance.  Then suddenly (within one second) again I saw them directly through the side window, parallel to my car, only about 10 meters above the ground; and then they zoomed across the freeway at a sharp angle in front of me (perhaps 50 meters in front of me), going from west to east, ascending rapidly and vanishing from my ! sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I say, the lights &#34;folded into themselves.&#34;  What I mean is that I didn&#39;t perceive this as a solid object or &#34;craft&#34; with a particular shape, with lights mounted on certain features of it, etc., as one would see on an airplane.  The lights were just lights, flying in a formation that remained generally triangular; but with additional dimensions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They continued this &#34;folding&#34; and &#34;unfolding&#34; the whole time I observed, though at first I didn&#39;t perceive it that way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn&#39;t perceive there to be any &#34;mass&#34; to it, apart from the lights.  The lights sort of catapulted and cartwheeled within themselves, inside a certain defined space that itself was in motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the course of a few seconds, my thoughts evolved as follows:<n> <n><n> <n><n> 1. Is that an overpass up ahead with a big truck crossing it? I think it&#39;s crashing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2. Oh wait, it&#39;s some kind of airplane, coming in to land, is there an airport right there on the left? I don&#39;t think so... I think it&#39;s crashing!<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3. Oh, it didn&#39;t crash, it&#39;s flying very acrobatically; maybe it&#39;s a crop-duster?  At night?!<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4. Ha!!! This is definitely a UFO! Those lights are moving very strangely! Where&#39;s my camera... OK found it... Too late, damn it, it&#39;s way back there now... I bet I see it again though... Ha! Here it is again!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were to compare the motion of the lights (&amp; their folding/unfolding) to something I&#39;ve seen before:  I would say it resembled the motion of &#34;nunchakus&#34; (the Chinese martial arts weapon) when being used by an expert.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As you may have seen in old Bruce Lee films, nunchakus are essentially two sticks connected at one end by a short chain.  Imagine that there was a light on each end of both sticks, and one on the middle of the chain; imagine that an expert was using them, but in somewhat slower motion than usual.  That&#39;s roughly how it looked as they wheeled about through the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another weapon that the lights and their motion resembled is the &#34;primitive&#34; hunting tool, the bolo.  Two or three rocks are tied together in a certain way, and hunters skillfully throw this cluster at the target. It is sort of like a boomerang, but with less form.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could also suggest that it&#39;s motion was like something you might see in a very simple kaleidoscope.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not notice any particular sound associated with what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were to estimate the size of this cluster of lights: Perhaps 5-10 meters in diameter at any particular moment? As I say, it didn&#39;t seem to be a solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time the lights came &#34;back&#34; to me I had found my camera on the seat beside me. I took one picture through the side window and one through the front windshield. Both pictures came out poorly; it was dark inside the car, the lights were moving and I was holding the camera rather unsteadily as I drove. In the picture through the side window, one sees two parallel streaks of light, moving horizontally but beginning to ascend. They look like two snakes, racing. In the picture through the front, the lights look like bright parallel streaks, sort of curved, ascending sharply. At the time, I didn&#39;t perceive them this way. I think the streak-effect is from the motion of the lights, the motion of my car, and my camera&#39;s slow &#34;automatic&#34; shutter speed in the dark.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It should be noted that there are several military airfields in the region, including at least one where testing of aircraft takes place (or used to take place).  The Crow&#39;s Landing Naval Auxiliary Landing Field, which supposedly closed in 1999, is about 70 miles to the northwest.  Many experimental aircraft were tested there, including projects with NASA.  I find evidence, though, that NASA may still be doing things at this base, despite the fact that its buildings have been demolished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On a web site dedicated to &#34;Abandoned &amp; Little-Known Airfields&#34; of California, there is the following comment (corroborated by a map-detail):  &#34;Even though Crows Landing is labeled as closed on the March 2013 Sectional Chart... a note still indicates “NASA flight test operations conducted in this area below 2,500&#39; MSL.”<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another military airbase in the region is Lemoore Naval Air Station, about 60 miles southeast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Conducting military test flights (especially of secret bizarre aircraft) at such low altitudes and high speeds, so near to hundreds of cars driving north and south on the freeway, would seem an incredibly stupid idea.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even so, it may still have been an experimental military or NASA aircraft of some kind, perhaps a newfangled &#34;drone.&#34;  Or perhaps it was something else.<n>

However there are no mountains near by and that night was overcast.  I stood there in the dark field looking at it from 7:55pm to 8pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went back home and asked my girlfriend to take a look at this strange orange glow in the sky.  She came out and at that time it started to pulsated white and orange very fast.  She went inside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began walking very slow to store and same time looking at orange glow.  I went inside and noticed a friend of mine inside.  I asked him about glow and if it was normal in these neck of woods (knowing that a city near here called Eastland has towers of fire due to gas).<n> <n><n> <n><n> He stated it could be from neon sign near by.  I told him it could not be and it was lighting the whole south west sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went outside together to recheck SW Sky.  I pointed out where it was still glowing faintly and he was VERY SHOCKED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got home the orange glow faded out behind the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I searched the internet for any details but none was found.<n>

Looking S/E about 1mi away from me, a bright orange orb was coming towards me in a right to left direction.  Then I saw another orange orb, approx 1/4mi behind the first one.  Then another appeared. Then another.  Looking back at Orb#1, it was now closer...maybe .5mi away.  These orange orbs were solid in nature, no blinking, flashing, or dimming.  At any one time...my son and I saw 4 lights all in a row...stringing from left to right...with the left light being the closest and the far right being the farthest away.  It was already sundown, as this occurred just after dusk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the wierd part.  All 4 of these orbs were moving slowly and smoothly, then the first orb light faded out...then orb #5 appeared.   Then orb #2 faded out and #6 orb appeared, and so on.  Until all 8 orbs eventually appeared and faded just before hitting the town limits.  These orbs did NOT change direction ever, so it&#39;s not like the 1st orb turned, and that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t see the light.  Again, at any one time, we saw 4 or 5 of the orbs...all bright orange.   We walked out front and watched....it was dead silent....no sound at all. We should have heard sound from that distance. All orbs flew at the same altitude....I would say at about 750ft up. No trail, smoke, or fire around the orbs. Just pure orange light.  Missed out on getting a camera.  We have one now, and will look for more events, in case of repeat visit.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

I thought maybe a group of helicopters, but I heard no engine noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3 light triangle formation slowed almost to a stop and rotated clockwise in almost a full circle and started heading east.  The lights very far apart, maybe 1/3rd a mile apart from each other, it did not seem that far from the ground, maybe as high as small planes travel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I could see the stars through the 3 point triangle formation so I don&#39;t think it was a solid object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My dogs did bark, but they bark at anything.

We both thought it was a helicopter covering a story of some sort as it was hovering and not moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we got closer and almost underneath I saw that the lights were not spot lights and that there were clearly 3 lights ( one on each corner) and 1 slowly blinking red light in the center.<n> <n><n> We could clearly see the outline of the craft and i would guess that it was at least 60-80 ft from point to point.  We were close enough to realize that it was making no noise.  It slowly hovered to the south and then to the west maybe 600 feet to the west of rt 28.  We drove in to Walmart parking lot as a Police car was speeding out in the same direction towards the craft.  We quickly parked and got out of the car to watch it and it was gone.<n>

It was 5:40 Toronto time, although I later wondered if it was 4:40.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did record this immediately, although I have edited it for better clarification from my original.  We were about 35,000’, and above the clouds.  I was on the right side of the plane looking west, possibly towards Texas or just north?  I obviously thought that I saw a plane, or an object similar, as my first thought was one of alarm, why was a plane flying so close to us?  There is no doubt as to what I saw.  It was not a reflection from the window of our plane’s lights, markings etc.  I took a video out of the window at the end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting may have lasted around 20 seconds.  I took many still photos just after the sighting of both outside, and the window.  The UFO was relative to the clouds we were flying above, which is how I best guessed the distance of being approximately 10 miles away parallel, or just ahead of the nose of the plane.  But then it started to fly away, and I was relieved - it instantaneously soared away.  It was incredible!  It became a bright oval ball (light) that was actually larger than a plane, as if encompassing a plane, or a craft.  It became close to being a triangle a bit as it flew away, not too much though.  As if its speed stretched the light around it.  I felt better as it started to fly away.  It was flying sideways to us, and back a bit.  Anyway, it suddenly veered back towards our plane, and once again I became concered.  Then halfway back it stopped in midair!  Just like that.  It then went away from the plane again, zig-zagging twice sharply as it did so, and again just stopped in mid-air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got my cell and iPad out of my bag, it was leaving from view, back and behind from my seat – from our wing.  I just jammed the iPad against the window and got this brief video.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was not looking through my jammed iPad perhaps what I videoed was a light reflection, though I don’t know how that would be possible as it was pressed firmly against the window.  Speculation?  I am obviously open too what I saw – military, unknown? Whatever it was I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS As soon as it happened I took photos from my cell of my iPad photos so I would have them in 2 locations &amp;#61514;<n> <n><n> <n><n> PPS if given an email address I could forward/attach photos<n>

The light was flickering.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object appeared to be a few thousand feet high, (from my perspective) and was moving almost uncontrollably.  The craft was close, but there was no sound; it was a stealth.  The only reason I seen it was because of the flickering engine.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was small and appeared to be light-grayish in color.  After I observed the craft for about a minute to 90 seconds, it dropped to approximately 500ft before going over the ridge.<n>

I went to light my cigarette and looked to the right of my front porch toward the neighbors yard.  I saw the street light that belongs to someone across the field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the left of that street light slightly above the tree line was what appeared to be a star.  It was sitting there and appeared to be moving very slowly.  It was barely above the trees so I watched for a few minutes.  The light was bright yellow-white and fading in and out.  No sounds that I could hear, and it is very quiet here at 4am.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was not blinking.  It would fade in and out completely to where you could not see it until it lit back up.  Those fade outs lasted a couple of seconds each time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched for about 10 minutes longer then I went back into the house.  When I looked out the window a, few minutes later, it had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So to be sure it was not still there, I opened the front door again, and it was gone.  I scanned the sky to see if it had moved toward the moon like a star but it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was some wind blowing at the time but once the light was gone the wind subsided.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have witnessed this yellow-white light several times in the past 4 years in different locations of the area I live in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Always the same pattern.

It was a rotating round bright orange light.

The craft was identifiable and appeared to be &#34;cloaked&#34; or partially invisible.  The circular craft had lights around the perimeter of the &#34;object&#34; that in a specific pattern appeared to rotate clockwise and then converged to the center &#34;middle of the craft like something focusing energy to the center.  The craft was extremely close to our proximity as we were directly under the object.  The craft looked to be constructed of a plant/animal like an organic material  which had what appeared to be hieroglyphic type of symbols or markings one of which looked like a snake another like an eye.  The craft had an area towards the center that had a cutout and we could see &#34;beings&#34; what appeared to be working and at one point I felt like they were communicating to us through thoughts.  My partner could not believe what we were observing and quickly grabbed his professional camera to record this spectacular occurrence in high definition while simultaneously recording with our smartphones.  We have 3 different videos from 3 separate devices.  He is also with the media and we have worked together on many news events over the years.  There  sound was mostly silent however there was a frequency that gave us a &#34;safe&#34; feeling that seemed to be pulsing with the movement of illuminations &#34;iridescent lights&#34; it felt like we were floating but the video did not capture either of us floating or defying 3D laws of physics.  There was someone outside and we have never seen that person before.  He claimed to be a neighbor and seemed uninterested in the object that was the size of the Staples Center (sports arena/stadium).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly after an hour of our observation, the craft seemed to fire some kind of blue/green- and red laser/photons that dematerialized the enormous craft and seemed to &#34;warp&#34; into thin air.  Again, we are both journalist and work in &#34;mainstream media&#34; we have been sitting on these videos for approximately a week as to investigate if any other videos or sightings were reported.  We cannot conclude if there were additional witnesses to this remarkable occurrence.  The exact location was about 4 miles from USC in Los Angeles.  The proximity of the object in reference to our location had to literally be 100-300 feet above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Like someone just turned off a flashlight!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that pilot saw it.  He/she was headed straight for it, since it was in their direct path! Then, poof! Gone!

2/23/14 21:30|Kilmarnock|VA|Triangle|3 seconds|Large, silent, high-flying speedy aircraft with triangle light alignment frightens skeptic.|2/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107434.html|95|ndxe201402| Large, silent, high-flying speedy aircraft with triangle light alignment frightens skeptic.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9:30 pm last night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> First off, I&#39;m a lifetime skeptic in every sense.  I&#39;ve never seen a UFO or anything that I couldn&#39;t think of a plausible explanation for.  I don&#39;t believe in ghosts, bigfoot, chupacabra, or alien-abductions.  I&#39;m a college-educated guy who has always had an interest in science and technology.  I wasn&#39;t on drugs or drinking.  I have no history of mental illness.  My assumption is that last night I caught a rare, brief glimpse of some kind of stealth aircraft of some sort.  That assumption doesn&#39;t make the vivid memory of it less discombobulating to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last night was clear and starry.  So clear and nice that I had gone outside to watch the International Space Station do a pass-over just after sunset.  Later in the evening I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  The sky seemed even more deeply dark and starry at that point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was smoking and gazing up at the constellation Orion, wondering what the name of the bright orange star in the constellation was (it&#39;s Betelgeuse.)  Because i&#39;m so curious, I pulled out my iPhone and launched an astronomy map that identifies stars.  It uses the phone&#39;s accelerometer to label stars and planets as you point the phone around the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After satisfying my curiosity, I put the phone back in my pocket and returned my gaze to Orion when suddenly a fast-moving triangular set of solid reddish lights caught my eye moving from zenith down towards the Orion&#39;s belt.  The direction was from NE at zenith to SW when it disappeared after a solid, enthralling three seconds.  Absolutely no sound whatsoever!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The diameter of the perfect triangle was the width of about 2 of my thumbnails held at arm&#39;s length. It disappeared right about parallel to Orion&#39;s belt to its right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt speechless, like I had seen a ghost for the first time.  What was so striking was that it seemed to be massive, supersonic, and flying at a high altitude.  What implied massive and high altitude, to me, was the fact that at no time during those three seconds did the individual lights in the triangular formation seem to change position in relation to one another.  If the object were lower, the fixed lights would have appeared to come together as it continued on its straight course to the SW.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was also disturbing to not hear any noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m unsure how to accurately describe its speed, but the speed seemed tremendous when including the lack of perspective distortion of the lights.  The lights were orange or red and of similar brightness to a constellation like Orion.  But this thing was booking it.  It instantly seemed unnatural and part of some type of technology because of its perfect symmetry and straight-line path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m still kind of in shock. I&#39;m still looking for some kind of explanation.  I&#39;ve thought of every angle to debunk my own vivid memory of it and can&#39;t think of anything.  Some kind of meteor which had its light perfectly refracted into a triad by the atmosphere?  I&#39;m not an astro-physicist but I wish Neil Degrasse Tyson had been with me to witness what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been looking up at the sky all my life.  I have seen meteors, comets, satellites, aircraft, weird weather….I have never seen anything like what I saw last night.<n>

We stopped the car, got out, saw a bright orb in the sky.  The orb moved very slowly at first.  Then began to zig zag across the sky.  At one point it changed its bright lights to peripheral lights as if it were making a landing and powering down.  Then it disappeared behind the tree line.  The general direction the object was seen was over the general vicinity of Stone Mountain.<n>

We slowed down in amazement and my wife noticed it was barely moving.  It was basically hovering above some trees about 100 to 150 feet above the ground.  It was hovering above trees on the edge of the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife was actually able to look up at it as we drove by since it was on the passenger side.

I noticed 2 orange lights in the same vicinity just above the treeline and west of the road through the front windshield.  The orange lights were similar in color to the street lamps common to Anchorage;  however, the orange lights were at a higher elevation than street level.  At first, I thought they might be lights atop radio or cellular towers, but as I focused, towers never manifested themselves and I wasn&#39;t aware of any towers in the residential neighborhood I was near.  That was my initial judgement as to elevation.  It was dark and the UFO&#39;s never manifested shape or elevation - only orange light.  The lights also appeared stationary.  There were small aircraft operating that night with the customary white lights or blinking lights.  As I turned west onto Abbott Road and then north again into a neighborhodd on Cathedral Way.  The lights appeared d! irectly overhead and visible through my sunroof.  I opened the sunroof to get a better look.  At this time, only one orange light was visible to me.  It appeared stationary but then began to move in a southwesterly direction.  No engine noise heard.  The orange light was round/oval and flickered slightly before the orange light dimmed completely.  At that point, the object resembled and appeared to have altitude similar to a satellite moving in orbit.  I followed the object until I could no longer see it.  So, not sure if I was catching sun off a large satellite moving in polar orbit (i&#39;ve seen plenty of satellites orbit and never one display an orange light like this one) or if I was catching a drone moving in the area or something else.<n>

At 7:32 pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was out taking my two dogs to go to the bathroom.  I was standing in front of my neighbors house, waiting for my 2 dogs to do their business, and I was just looking around.  I noticed a very strange looking whispy cloud that was a shallow u shape elongated west to east.  With the tops of the u being in each direction.  While studying the cloud I noticed some kind of movement.  As I tried to look at what was moving it was very hard to make out.  I had to look slightly off to one side, or the other of the object to make it out better.  It was a v shape.  It was moving from east going west across the sky.  Moving from where the cloud was, away from it.  It almost appeared to have a series of either lights, or reflections going the whole width and length of the v. the v seemed to be skinny almost just like the letter v.  except the v would be flatted,  At a shallow angle.  It appeared slightly grey in color, although this could have been due to the very dim lights, or reflections coming from it.  As it moved from me I noticed two airplanes flying quite close.  One looked like it would almost intersect with it. Although the plane was at a higher elevation.  The craft seemed to be very big and move just slightly faster than an airplane. Its hard to say what elevation it was at. But it was maybe just a little higher than a lot of smaller personal aircraft fly.  As it flew I didn’t hear any noise from the craft/object.  As it moved father from me it got harder to see.  As if you could only really see it from a certain angle.  After it went behind a telephone or electrical cable, I lost it. It was very hard to see in the first place, and after my view got obstructed from the object I couldn’t find it again.  At that time though it was getting farther away and almost disappeared anyway.  It seemed the best way to view the object would have been from directly beneath it.  The object flew south of my viewing location by quite a few miles.  It may have been direc! tly over the town of Knapp creek ny.  Or somewhere else on rocky city hill.  And it would have been flying toward a path that would have taken it over top of Limestone, NY.  It could have been closer than this.  I can&#39;t really say, but if it was closer than it wasn&#39;t any closer to me than maybe 2 1/2- 3 miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is my account as best as I can describe it.  I would like to add that I had a feeling the craft/object was most likely a governmental craft, and not something other worldly.  I would also say it being an other dimensional craft would feel right to me as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If you have any other questions for me, please do not hesitate to call.<n>

It was a clear night and I noticed five bright amber colored circular lights traveling silently in the sky.  They were lower than an airplane but higher than a low helicopter.  They were in a straight line traveling close together from west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point the group formed a ‘t’ like pattern.  It reminded my of an air show where planes travel very close together and make formations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran inside to get my husband to see the oddity.  He came out with me and we stood at the end of my driveway and were looking at the lights traveling.  One of my neighbors was walking his dog and he also looked up to see the things in the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then in front of our eyes, one by one, they flickered out and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My neighbor then continued home, my husband went inside and I stayed outside to see if any more would show up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A minute or two later another string of three came through the same west to east path.  They also disappeared by flickering out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am college educated with a masters degree in business.  I have never seen any objects in the sky behave in this manner before, nor have I ever before been a &#39;believer&#39; in ufo&#39;s.<n>

To estimate the size, my thumb at arms length would&#39;ve covered half of it.  It was very low in the air, at about 200 feet above me and I&#39;d guess it was about that far ahead of me.  It was flying Extremely fast! I&#39;ve never seen anything fly that fast through the air.  It flew straight ahead of me, then veered up toward the left (northwest), and suddenly disappeared as if it were erased from the sky.  Just gone, just like that.  There was no sound, nor any debris or smoke in the air.  The sphere shape was more like a hamburger, tilted at 45 degrees, with a white light on the upper left side, a black line through the center, and a dark teal colored light on the bottom right side.  The lights were solid and were not blinking.  When it disappeared, I got a feeling that I wasn&#39;t supposed to see what I saw.  I searched the whole sky for any more sign of it, but there was nothing.  This is the first time I&#39;ve seen a UFO.  We do live close to an airport, so initially I thought it was a plane but it was flying so much faster than any jet that I&#39;ve ever seen and it disappeared completely.  The closest thing that I can compare it to would be a shooting star, because of the extremely fast speed and the way it disappeared, except that it was very low in the sky, traveling horizontally, veering up and away before it disappeared.  I don&#39;t know of anything that can do what it did.<n>

At first I thought it might be a traffic helicopter or a loose kite which had drifted away from its owner about 5 miles south of Mission Bay.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as we approached the object, it was absolutely still as my wife and I drove underneath it, in our SUV. We had an extremely clear visual observance of the craft which made no sound at all. My wife remarked that it “might be a drone of some sort”.  This was not a helicopter, kite, nor a “drone”.   Oddly, the sky was just beginning to clear from a fog bank, and we had just passed the SD airport which still was engulfed in a layer of fog.  It didn&#39;t make sense for someone to be flying a kite in the fog at 6:40 in the morning nor a helicopter being in the sky with that much fog and being so low to the ground.  My Cruise ! control no longer functioned properly - it worked the day before.  Right after the encounter, I glanced back at our dog that we had in a cage in the back seat - she seemed a little restless and when I turned around to look at her - her left eye looked strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I thought they were planes but the don&#39;t move for hours.  I&#39;ve tried several times to take pictures but it always comes out to dark and you can&#39;t see them.  I&#39;ve used several different applications on my phone to try and identify them as possibly being a star, planet, satellite, or anything that makes sense but when I point my phone at then it just shows up as empty space.<n>

And look at the sky to see the stars, they were so shine, and suddenly I noticed  five lights like, the size and bright  as the stars, I can not describe exactly the shape because this is the first time in my life I saw something like that, it was moving in the sky I thought a was a plane but my wife told me no, that is not a plane, then I  said looks like birds, but they were to high in the sky, and what it was even weird, this five lights while moving started to separate 3 of the lights from the other 2 lights, but still  Moving on, then when I finally decided to grab my iphone from my pocket to recorded this lights vanished in the sky.<n>

We stopped at the main stoplight in town.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was triangle shaped and on each point was a light: green, red, and white.  It seemed to slow down above us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It ascended over the building next to the passenger&#39;s side and, with great speed, it kept ascending and flew from our sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is important to notes that we were So close that I could see triangle shaped etching on the bottom of the craft.<n>
2/22/14 22:23|Fond du Lac|WI|Cigar|8 seconds|I saw a luminous silver colored cigar shaped object travelling west to E.  It was N of my position in central Fond du Lac.|2/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107378.html|119|ndxe201402| I saw a luminous silver colored cigar shaped object travelling west to east.  It was north of my position in central Fond du Lac, thus putting the object over North Fond du Lac and southern portion of Lake Winnebago, possible even over or nearly overhead of Oshkosh, WI.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It had a very flat trajectory, but it appeared ever so slightly to be losing altitude.  It had silver sparks coming out of the trailing edge, reminiscent of the cheesy old Flash Gordon movies.  It was considerably faster than an airplane, but it wasn&#39;t going so fast as to be a blur.  It had a distinct cigar shape to it, and it made no discernible noise from my location that I could hear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At arm&#39;s length, the object would have been about half the width of my thumbnail, so I guess that&#39;s about a bit more than half of a centimeter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I only saw it for about 8 seconds, then I lost view when tree cover obscured my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The reason I don&#39;t believe it was a bolide or meteor was because of its very flat trajectory.<n>

For a second I thought it was a meteor, but it was not moving as fast (but much faster than an airplane) and it kept going until I couldn&#39;t see it over the hill.  It didn&#39;t burn out like a typical &#34;shooting star.&#34;  It did have a tail, however, so it clearly wasn&#39;t a plane.  I couldn&#39;t hear any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a scientist, but I&#39;m not a nut, either.  I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before.<n>

What I can only explain was an object moving at a fast rate of speed through my field of view.  I was able to track it for a second before passing the scope off to my wife who viewed it but was unalble to follow it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object moved pass stars in the background and was seemed relativley close to the other objects in field of view.<n>

I was facing in my groomer NE and noticed a group of 10 lights.|2/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107393.html|125|ndxe201402| While grooming ski trails at Burke mountain in east Burke, Vt, I was facing in my groomer northeast and noticed a group of 10 lights that were very bright reddish orange in color.  The lights appeared to be 6-8 miles from me at approximately 5000 feet.  These lights were circular and stayed constant in brightness and color.  I was approximately at 3000 feet and last night was moonless but very clear with approximately 50 miles visibility.  The shape of the 10 lights started at the top 2 large circles and under that 2 smaller ones and that pattern continued down until they were quite small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took out my cell phone to get photos but at that point the lights started from the bottom left to right started to fade out.  The next set to go off were the largest top lights same left to right pattern then back to the bottom and again to the top until they all were gone.  I continued back to the top of the mountain and as I proceeded back down the trail and arrived at the s! ame area I saw the lights again appear in the opposite as they faded out.  I again took my phone out to get photos and only got one of the lights captured.  It looks somewhat cylindrical but as you zoom in almost slightly half moon shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have groomed the ski trails there for about 30 years and know the sights at night and this was not a sight seen in all those years<n>
2/22/14 20:00|Charlottesville|VA|Light|45 seconds|Red ball of light, became a halo as it moved up into the sky, flew erratically then straightened out.|2/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107369.html|126|ndxe201402| Red ball of light, became a halo as it moved up into the sky, flew erratically then straightened out<n> <n><n> <n><n> One object came up from the South.  It started low on the horizon, and I thought it was just a plane heading North for a landing, as planes often fly over from that direction as they&#39;re heading North to land at the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was really low, though, and right as I was about to look away, I saw it jerk to the West suddenly.  My initial reaction was “what the hell?”  I thought then that it might be a meteor that was splitting up, and that it was so low it might hit nearby.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My view was partially obscured by the bare branches of a tree in front of me, so I moved out away from the tree to see if I could verify it was just an aircraft or meteor.  I kept my eye on the thing as I walked out away from the building I live at, and it continued to jerk side to side as it headed North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got a good view of it without any obstructions, I could tell it wasn&#39;t a plane.  There were no flashing lights.  It wasn&#39;t making any sound at all, and it was moving significantly faster than any aircraft that pass by here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched, I noticed it was gaining altitude.  It wasn&#39;t heading straight up, but it definitely arced upwards and kept on its path North.  After a few seconds, the jerking motions stopped and the center of the object actually blacked out while I still had a clear, unobstructed view, so the thing became this dim red halo of light against the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it a few more seconds, thinking it was going to disappear, because it was definitely headed up, but it actually picked up speed and just kept going North.  Last I saw, it was speeding off.  I could barely catch it through the trees when it neared the Northern horizon, but I could still make out the light through the tree branches.<n>

The object was not blinking and there was no discernible sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately afterwards, 4 pairs of the same type of object flew in the same direction/altitude/speed, followed by 3 more that flew over individually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest part was that some of them seemed to very quickly &#34;burn out&#34; and disappear before leaving my line of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This seemed remarkably similar to a sighting I saw posted on this site in Broomall just a few days ago.  My most logical guess was that these were helicopters at higher than normal altitude, but the lack of any sound has really puzzled me.  I have never seen anything like them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

By the time we turned around on the exit to head north on 293 it vanished..<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was way to big to disappear that quickly, we scanned the sky, both of us unable to see any sign of this huge and extremely bright craft. It seemed it was hovering over the Merrimack river.<n>

It stayed in the formation shape for approx. 2 minutes and traveled from west to east, across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights were red and blinking slowly.  Size of the lights was slightly larger than the stars in the sky, around the same shape and size, and the craft appeared to come from the star cluster and not from the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Elevation is 828 feet in the area, and the craft was approx. 900 feet in the sky, as it just came across the mountain.  It traveled over a ridge to the east, and we lost sight of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the moment, we were using a parabolic microphone, and the craft made no sound. There was a jet that traveled a moment before the craft, and one that traveled several minutes after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, our electrical equipment drained battery power, and physical drainage from people involved in the sighting occurred.<n>

She ran down to the property line where it was clear of trees and we had a clear view of the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was then that we looked to the sky and saw 9 oval shaped, orange objects heading NW one after another.  Occasionally, they flickered and seemed to hover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were moving at 40 mph and lower than airplanes normally fly above our area.  It was astounding.  The direction and speed of the wind is South @ 8 MPH.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When they were out of sight from our home we jumped in the car and traveled north on Highway 441 where we were then able to catch sight of two of the craft, but when they reached a certain spot they both vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We include an iron worker, a secretary, an office manager and a middle school teen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was so stunning that we called the Director of this website, Mr. Davenport, to report this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are certain others witnessed! this event as well and we hope they too will report it.<n>

As I look up I noticed 4 red lights in a line formation kind of look like circles but bright red like a light buld shine they had like a blinking to th lights.  I thought to myself what is that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I hurried into the apartment building I ran up the stairs to the third floor which is the floor I live on and got my mom and told her to hurry and come outside to the fire escape.  I told her to look and tell me if she could see what I was seeing.  I didnt want to look like I was crazy.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time the objects were closer together in a circle shape and stared to just move around slowly in diferent directions.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mom said she was gonna run in and grab her phone cause my phone was dead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When she came back out most of them just vanished.  I did get to capture 2 of the objects one photo is kind of fuzzy.  These objects were observe facing west.  I will try to email or send regular mail the picture I have.  If I cant send them I will have them printed out and put away in case u send someone out to get them.<n>

Geometric formation (diamond, triangle)<n> <n><n> <n><n> While driving home on the interstate from Williston, VT, to Richmond just after dusk, I looked out to the left and saw around 4 very bright, glowing orbs in the sky.  At first I thought that maybe it was a plane (The Burlington airport is somewhat nearby) turning toward me, since I know how bright the lights can be, but the orbs didn&#39;t move, and they were so incredibly bright that I couldn&#39;t imagine what they were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had time to pull out my cellphone, unlock it, and record 48 seconds of video footage.  During that time I noticed maybe one additional orb, and many tiny orbs around the big ones (not sure if I only just noticed them at that point, or whether they were being emitted from the orbs.)  It looked like several concentrated, ball-shaped fireworks had gone off but were just hanging in the sky and not falling or fading.  In the video you can see that the orbs come together, and form a tight triangle.  It looked to be like they were descending.  At the end of the video I enter a line of trees as I start to descend French Hill and the orbs can&#39;t be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They seemed fairly close to me, within a mile or two.  Low altitude, again, like fireworks. I noticed a truck had pulled off to the side of the road on South Road (which runs along the interstate briefly), and perhaps they were observing the objects as well.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish that my phone could have captured the bright, orange glow from the objects, but if you&#39;ve ever tried to take a picture at night with your phone, you know how diminished the brightness of an object can be.<n>

I thought it may have been an airplane on fire, but it was just a ball shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and I could both see what looked to be a glow coming from fire or flames.  It didn&#39;t emit much light into the surrounding sky, and was well below the cloud line.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was clear, and we could tell the object was much closer than other stars, or the altitude at which an airplane would have been flying.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object didn&#39;t move forward, backward, or anything.  It just seemed to hover and we drove right under it.<n>

I noticed a small light moving among the stars.  The light moved in every direction impossibly.  It moved in circles and up and down and side-ways and it made no sound. It looked like a star or satellite but like I said it moved im-possibly. It did not move across the entire sky as it only covered a little space in the sky.  It continued for a few minutes and then dissipated. It was soon out of my vi-sion.  This has happened 10 times in my life the recent being In February this year 2014 seeing 6 lights within a two week period and one night seeing 2.  It always happened at nightmore frequently around 7pm. I was in upper Bidwell park. 1 light was more orange than the usual yellow/white star looking light.  There was never any sound.  Some moved irratically and dissipated quickly while others moved straight and very fast and dissipated (at least 1000mph based on time and distance travelled) or turned slightly and dissipated. It felt as if when I noticed them is when they dissapeared.  There is an airport near where I have seen most of these lights.  I have been walking at night in the park for years and am very aware of all of the different air traffic including satellites.  No other craft like airplanes or other lights followed the lights.  1 time one of the lights turned from white to orange as it dissipated<n>

All the way towards the right, a bright light the size of an meteor and as bright as a planet suddenly appeared.  The color was white, like an LED lightbulb.  When I saw it at first I yelled, &#34;Look, a shooting star!&#34;  Quickly, I realized it was not a star.  Most of the stars were hardly visible from light pollution from the street lights.  It didn&#39;t flicker or flash like stars, planes or towers.  It seems much closer, bigger, and brighter than any of the stars.  After about 1 second, it split into two and one light went up and one went down creating a sideways Y.  This was a perfect triangle formation.  In about 1/3 of a second it completely disappeared.  When the light divided into two they were equally as bright and big as the original one was.  They disappeared in perfect sync, down to the millisecond.  I&#39;d estimate it was about 1/2-1 mile away.  During the event, I didn&#39;t feel anything other than amazement and awe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The two witnesses were myself and my father.  Neither of us have ever been to interested in UFOs, so it was not like we would be looking for that sort of thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time of the alleged sighting in order to reflect an evening sighting.

2/22/14 10:30|Washington, D.C.|DC|Formation|20 seconds|8 orbs of light flew  directly over head in a formation before a synchronized deformation and dissapearance. Lone orb 5 min later.|2/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107425.html|147|ndxe201402| 8 orbs of light flew  directly over head in a formation before a synchronized deformation and dissapearance. Lone orb 5 min later<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and 6 other people were on a 9th floor rooftop in Washington D.C.&#39;s Dupont Circle neighborhood at roughly 10:30 PM.  Something directly above me caught my eye.  I looked up to see 8 orbs of light flying silently in formation about 2000 yards up.  The orbs looked to resemble what we know as a plane.  Four orbs in a straight line with two orbs going out to each side and angled toward the back of the formation at the midway point of the 4 in-line orbs.  It was immediately evident that this was not a plane however as the clouds that were in the back ground (much higher in the sky) were clearly visible in the space between the orbs.  The orbs of light traveled in this formation for roughly 15 seconds going south to north.  At the 15 second mark the formation went through a synchronized “deformation scramble” into an amorphous unidentifiable jumble (still retaining their individual properties just no longer in a geometric formation of any kind).  The mass of unorga! nized orbs accelerated not over the horizon but directly following our horizontal site line.  The lights then vanished completely at a height I can only describe as three fingers above the horizon (holding my hand out a foot in front of my face) and roughly 5 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes later someone facing the south (I was facing north) said, “Look another one.”  I again looked immediately up to see a single orb of light, flying at the same altitude and in the same direction as the previous 8 orbs.  This one had a more defined haze of light surrounding it and was lighter/whiter in color.  At around the same distance as the deformation described in the previous paragraph, the single orb began to move laterally; from my view point no more than a 10-15 degree divergence from its northern flight path on either side.  Essentially it began to wiggle back and forth for 5 seconds as it continued its northern progression in the same direction as the previous 8.  The orb then disappeared in roughly the same spot as the ones prior.<n>

There was way too low to be satellites ir shooting stars.  It looked like it was a part of a bigger object.  Moving very low, very fast and very silent.  By the time I turned my astrological binoculars toward it I couldn&#39;t find it.  It was gone.

Apparently stationary--moved with stars.|2/27/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107359.html|150|ndxe201402| Cross of lights with streams at ends covering the center of my binocular&#39;s field of vision.  Apparently stationary--moved with stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Insomniac me was up at 4:30.  I happened to look out our front window--and saw a very bright light shining like a flashlight in the sky but seemingly not moving in the southeastern quadrant.  Much too bright for a star.  Apparently not one of those cargo planes that land at a nearby AF base.  I looked through my 15x70 astronomical binoculars--and what I saw was a plus-sign shaped arrangement of bright lights covering the center of the binocular&#39;s field of vision--perhaps a half dozen or so each way with streams of light coming from the four ends. Sort of like a cross of headlights.  Steady, not flashing, yellow-white.  My wife watched it too--she told me not to go outside!  I watched it on and off for over an hour until it disappeared with daybreak.  As I kept watching it appeared to move very slowly westward--as if it was stationary in the sky, but changing its apparent position with the Earth&#39;s rotation as the stars do.  That would mean it was very high up above the reach of our gravity and therefore given its appearance in the binocs, very large.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Perhaps an object reflecting the rising Sun?  But the Sun was well below the horizon, the lights were facing my direction, and they hardly looked like reflections. Anyway, what kind of object could it be?  Space station?  Doesn&#39;t look like that.  Satellite?  No way. &#34;Craft&#34;?  Well, it was evidently not a natural phenomenon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of course, I e-mailed the relevant authorities and media, and of course they will ignore it.  I have no way of knowing who else might have seen it.<n>

We were about to go inside, and out of the corner of my eye I saw one pulsating fireball.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I stopped my mother from entering the house and I pointed it out to her.  At first my mother and I were trying to rationalize it, but in our hearts we knew exactly what it was because we have witnessed them before on New Years Eve 12/31/13 twice in one night at separate times.  The only difference between this sighting and our last sighting is that there was only one single fireball this time.  They usually show up in groups of 5 or more.    We know this because of our previous sightings from New Years Eve.  The sighting we witnessed tonight was just one fireball.  It had the same characteristics as our previous sighting. It was not high up in the sky and it appeared to be rising.  It was gradually floating up further and further into the sky while it simultaneously pulsated.  It was red and had a orange tint, but more red than orange.  It was a lot larger than any star we had seen in the sky, about 3 times the size.  It was the only object that was that low in the sky.  It would appear larger every time it pulsated.  We watched it for about 2 minutes or so making sure that it is a fireball before we e went ahead and reported it.  As it continued to rise up from what seemed to be a really low point in the sky, it started to fade away.  Then it just vanished.<n>

Speed was typical of an ISS normal pass.  Strange that this small extended “object” could be observed through small low cumulus clouds.  The ISS seldom allows you to observe it through clouds.  Its color was pale yellow and not so “starlike” and pinpoint as I´m accustomed to observe the ISS or any normal satellite.  I describe it´s trayectory as in  polar orbit.  Magnitude was probably  -1 to -2<n> <n><n> <n><n> 2)  	A short time later I observe, in the south-east, a smaller and dimmer polar orbiting satellite, more starlike, travelling at normal satellite angular speed.  It looked more normal to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 3)  	As I was lying on a reclining chair I stood up to go downstairs and into my dormitory.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 4)  	I suddenly noticed two bright (mag: -1) “stars” travelling in a parallel South-North polar orbit and separated about 15° or arc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 5)  	Following these two “leading lights” my eyes had to refocus to make sure I was observing countless smaller luminous starlike and white objects follow these two leaders.  They were less bright than the first original object and probably of magnitude +1 or +2. They were probably two to three dozen luminous objects which all shared a tendency to slightly zig-zag in uncorrelated manners respect to each other.  Their speed was similar to the other sightings.  All, so far, have appeared to be upper or mid atmosphere phenomena.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 6)  	Following the cluster I detected what seemed, like a slightly larger repetition of the first object.  It was definitely an extended object, not pinpoint, and with a warm yellowish-orange tint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 7)  	I suddenly realized I had enough sky to dare getting my binoculars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 8)	  I ran down the stairs and entered my nearby dormitory to grab my high quality Russian 8 x 32 binoculars.  I keep my optical equipment in good condition always.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 9)	  As I returned to the roof I realized I had time to calmly point and focus on the brighter extended object.  The binoculars were already focused for my eyesight on both eyes.  I rapidly adjusted for inter-pupillary distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> 10)	  As I was able to focus on the object with enough extension and angular size to discern details, good focus and definition, I identify the object as follows:<n> <n><n> <n><n> a)  	It was composed or configured by an agglutination of brilliant points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> b)  	Between all these brilliant points there seemed to be a glowing glare not due to optical light scattering or dispersion.  It seemed more like a “plasma of some kind”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> c)	  All these small lights were “locked” in spatial positions respect to the others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> d)	  All these lights rolled or rotated along an horizontal axis just like a wheel would do on the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> e)	  All lights revolved around this common axis as though they were attached to some invisible bonding structure.  They always kept their relative positions with respect to each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> f)  	I tried to share this experience with a friend and dialed his cell phone number.  This was a mistake as I admit and realize I should have taken this experience to its end without interruption.  The unidentified object occulted behind overhead clouds and was never seen exiting the group of clouds.   I stayed for 10 or 20 minutes more and noticed no more activity.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you for allowing me to make this report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was staring at my neighbor&#39;s back yard across the way from mine towards the east north east - when I turned my head up, and towards the south east (ESE) of my position I suddenly noticed two bright, white, stationary objects side by side - somewhat resembling bright planets or stars ((sic)),such as Jupiter, Uranus, or Venus would naturally appear from a normal ground viewing vantage point).  The object on the right side being about 30 degrees lower in the sky than the other object on the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were a little brighter than Venus - and both actually somewhat resembled how Venus looks to a naked eye observer.  The objects were an unremarkable white color.  They reminded me of how two close binary stars would appear if they were close enough to our solar system to be that bright in the night sky.  They were brighter than Venus - and about as bright as an aircraft at night with it&#39;s fog beams / spot lights on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I first saw them - I knew that they were not there a few moments earlier - and I also reasoned to myself that they could not be stars because they were simply too bright - and they were not planets because only Venus approaches that magnitude of brightness - and there is only one Venus.  My exact knee jerk first thought was &#34; Those can&#39;t be planets - and there isn&#39;t a constellation that looks like that!&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The higher object after a few seconds appeared to begin to very slowly and subtly move (or rather &#34;float&#34; or &#34;drift&#34;) upward - curving a little to the right, but the motion was again, very subtle and gradual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few minutes - maybe about three minutes - both objects then faded out completely, metaphorically as if under the influence of a &#34;dimmer switch&#34; - until they were visually un-trackable.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stunned - and started to run back into the house when I decided to take a quick look around to see if maybe more were up there - and I glanced four, maybe five other objects at an extremely high altitude to the north east (NNE) &#34;swimming&#34; around each other - before finally separating and heading in a northerly direction (a few appeared to travel ENE, while at least two others looked to be headed due North).  These objects were dimmer and less perceivable than the objects that I had just witnessed a few seconds earlier - due again - to their greater altitude, but all were basically points of light.  One object appeared to have a more pinkish color hue than the others - and appeared to be either a tad bit brighter, or possibly larger - this object was one of I believe two that drifted away in a more Northward direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The entire incident lasted from about 7:50PM EST (0:50 ZULU), to 8:05PM (1:00 ZULU).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It is my desire to remain anonymous.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report has elected to remain anonymous, and provides no contact information.

My neighbor had already been witnessing the event for fifteen minutes when I joined them.  We observed several red lights, moving unusually fast from the Southeast direction at a diagonal towards the Northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For an estimated 40 minutes total, they kept coming, 60 seconds to 3 minutes apart, following the same diagonal trajectory; initially in pairs, then one after another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately, we noticed that this was not any aircraft, airplane or helicopter, as the red light was disembodied, and pulsing/ flickering irregularly (like a candle) as opposed to uniform regular flashing as with a helicopter.  The red lights also seemed to have a red halo.  They also seemed to be close enough (at helicopter height) that we should have been able to make out the body had it been a man-made aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The movement was unusual: it would zoom from the horizon in a quick burst, then stop and remain stationary for a minute or two, before shooting straight up into the atmosphere and disappearing at an incredible speed.  Sometimes, after coming to a stop, they would slowly turn in meandering half circles, before shooting up.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point, one of these red lights shot up close to passing airplane (we live close enough to the airport to see several passing planes at various heights) and we were able to observe that it began below the plane and shot up above it as it made its ascent at tremendous speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I personally observed a total of 6, with my neighbor claiming to have witnessed 11 total.<n>

I thought it may be planets until they disappeared.  I walked east down the sidewalk to see if it was the clouds when I noticed the 2 orbs again are now in line with the community pool about 100ft west.  In turn, the objects now seemed further yet the solid intensity of the orbs were still full.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran and got my son out of the house and explained what I saw and were, we waited watching the area of interest.  Within a few minutes we saw from the southeast appear an orb and begin to move in a north west direction behind it was another following the same path.  They seemed to remain within a close distance and at the same point began to go in a westward direction.  They sort of slowed down almost to stop when a 3rd orb appeared from the exact same southeast location.  The 2 first orbs moved slightly westward and came to a stop then seemed to ascend directly out towards the atmosphere until they disappeared.  A few minutes later a neighbor was walking and asked what we were doing then saw for herself the orb appearing from the southeast.  We moved closer to the pool area to avoid street lights and watch as an additional 6 in total passed through the same path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did try to find the weather direction for that time but the best I could do is:  &amp;#61607;	Point Forecast: Point Forecast: Winter Park FL 28.6°N 81.35°W (Elev. 92 ft) &amp;#61607;	Last Update: 8:55 pm EST Feb 21, 2014 &amp;#61607;	Forecast Valid: 10pm EST Feb 21, 2014-6pm EST Feb 28, 2014 Source: http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Winter+Park&amp;state=FL&amp;site=MLB&amp;textField1=28.5959&amp;textField2=-81.3437&amp;e=0#.UwgJeDiPKUk<n>

He said he&#39;d seen multiple objects moving across the night sky; they appeared to be coming from the northwest.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By the time I got outside, I saw just three or four passing overhead.  They gave off a dim orange glow, and looked like they might be hot air balloons.  They appeared to float, but moved fairly quickly, eventually disappearing as if extinguished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They definitely did not look or move like airplanes or other identifiable types of aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both felt we had seen something strange and inexplicable.<n>

The two lights appeared to be connected together horizontally.  Imagine a traffic light sideways without the yellow and they were very bright.  One was red and the other green.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights moved together in sharp vertical and horizontal and diagonal movements.  I heard no sounds from this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I really had no idea what I was looking at but considered it could possibly be a remote control operated toy I guess but it just seemed rather an odd time as it had just recently stopped raining and I also had never seen any remote controlled toys like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I had seen an associated shape to it I might consider the toy option more but it was really just the two bright lights.<n>

I looked into the sky toward the north - this is a habit because I work at an airport that is located in that direction.  I witnessed a orange-red orb that appeared to have flames coming from the top and the area nearest me.  These flames did not flicker and they were slim pointed conic-shaped.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expected to see the object falling to earth because these flames appeared to be a something that would trail a burning object.  It did not reduce altitude, but continued on a steady plane toward the southwest.  I made video of it with my cell phone and followed it by walking on the sidewalk toward the west.  I recorded it until my phone battery died (late in the day).  I continue to observe it in the SW sky until large trees on the next street obstructed my view.  I decided to cross the street to get a better view - a car was coming so I trotted across to the next corner and allow the car to pass.  I looked up into the SW sky but could not see it because of a large house on the SW corner of the street.  I walked into the roadway to see if I could get a view of it between the house and the large trees.  I spotted it in the sky where I had last seen it.  It appeared stationary.  I looked down the roadway toward the west and saw another object similar to the first. It appear to be hovering over the ocean at about the same altitude as the first.  I am about 5 city blocks from the beach.  I looked at the second object for about 4-5 seconds and it appeared to dim until I could not see it any longer.  I turned my attention to the first object; it was still in the same location.  It then dimmed like the second object and disappeared.  Neither made any sound, if fact, it was very quiet in the neighborhood except for two cars that drove by--not a soul on the streets, which is unusual due to the mild weather and clear sky on a Friday night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I work at an airport in the area and I&#39;m very familiar with the type of aircraft in the skies in and around the area. I know the flight paths and can judge the altitude. These objects appeared to be tracking above the ground the same distance as the traffic pattern for the local flight schools - 1400 ft msl.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The color of the objects did not change, nor where there any blinking lights. Strangely, the flames did not illuminate the area around the objects or shine as beams. The bright red-orange color stayed within the shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Never have I seen anything like this - highly unlikely that these where planes, helicopters, blimps, UAV&#39;s, flares, balloons, or any craft that I have ever seen.<n>

We were standing at the end of my drive looking at the stars when my daughter pointed out what at first looked like a bright orange fire ball but it was quite a ways away.  At first it was sitting in the same spot but after a few minutes it started moving in our direction which would have been north.  It moved very slow and as we watched the lights started flashing.  We watched to see if it was an airplane but it did not look like an airplane as there were no red lights and the lights that were on it had started flashing and seemed to be moving around the object.  The object was nearly over us and it slanted as it turned and the top of the object had what I can only describe as a dome.  It then began moving faster and as it went over us we could see the lights that were orange and moved around the outside of the object.  It never got! close to us or close to the ground but close enough that we could see the lights and the dome.  Finally after about 15 minutes of watching the object sped up and we could no longer see it.<n>

I looked up from my bed through a window and was immediately alerted that this is not a normal light.  It was much larger than any other lights in the sky.  I live near a small airport and there were many small aircraft in the sky, and I assume, some circling to land.  So the contrast was quite large between the planes with small normal colors lights and this much larger brilliant orange light.  My first impression was that it was a jet, perhaps on fire.  The reason I thought it was on fire was that this orange shiny object has an orange contrail coming out of the rear and streaming back behind it for some distance.  This contrail was also orange and it had a particular quality about it.  It was clearly visible against the night sky and it looked metallic and as it got closer it looked like the sparkle one would see from fireworks, although the contrail was not cascading like fireworks as it had a consistent stream coming out of the rear of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its speed was very slow, about the speed of a small aircraft as it approaches a landing.  It gave me a few minutes to watch it.  When my view started to become blocked from the roof line, I ran to our balcony to continue watching.  As it continued across the sky still moving from left to right, north to south, it gradually and smoothly turned to the east and moved away from me.  A very short time later it blinked out, disappeared suddenly.<n>

What caught my eye is that they were much brighter than a plane and they were too close to each other to be planes or helicopters.  I looked west in the sky and saw that a few others had always gone past the house on the same path and were going out of view.  Four additional balls of light came into view.  Two of them looked as if they could cross paths but ended up straightening out and avoiding collision.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another pair followed the four and after that, four individual balls of light proceeded.  These final four came one at a time and as one crossed the sky to the point where I no longer could see it, the next one would show up and cross the sky.  There may have been more lights in total, but I only saw these by accident as they were in progress.  They were orange in color (they flickered like fireballs), they did not seem to be descending (or at least noticeably descending) and they did not make any sound (I opened the window to listen).<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Philadelphia airport is less than 20 miles away and I witnessed an occasional plane in the sky with blinking lights while this was going on, but seeing these planes only made it more apparent that these were definitely not a craft like that.  I have no idea what it was that I saw.  I just know that I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

It was mostly cloudy at the time.  At first the object was a whitish-yellow light like a plane with also a blinking green light.  It later changed to non-blinking green and red lights only, arranged horizontally.  We were looking due west. As experienced birdwatchers,  I got our binoculars for a better look.  It moved more quickly, complexly and unexpectedly than any aircraft I&#39;ve ever seen.  It dropped and ascended vertically several times, very, very fast.  It moved back and forth horizontally very fast and made several complex turning and arching maneuvers as well.  My girlfriend suspected we might be seeing a &#34;toy&#34; remote controlled aircraft.  I didn&#39;t think so.  Who would be out on a cloudy night like this in the middle of the week in a residential neighborhood flying planes?  It made no sound.

She said 2 fighter jets went towards that direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we stood there, the light shot straight up like a flare, changing colors, blue, green to red.  The light appeared to float to the left and then shot right.  It changed speed, direction, traveled up, down, sideways and finally dropped below the tree line again.  There is a Naval Research Lab in that direction.  This was all witnessed by me, my 12 yr. old son and my neighbor.  I am going to wait tonight around the sa! me time with a video camera and see.  It has been in the same place 3 nights .It traveled and changed direction too fast for air craft.<n>

At 7:15pm, I was walking outside to my car while looking up appreciating the clear night sky. While I was scanning the sky an extremely bright flash of light caught my attention.  The flash itself was very reminiscent of a signal flash you would get with mirrors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was a single flash of light then the light/object continued across the sky in a north east to west trajectory.  If I hadn&#39;t witnessed the flash of light I would have mistaken it for a satellite.  It was heading on a straight path with a constant speed and brightness for about 15-20 seconds then it completely vanished.  I searched the sky couldn&#39;t see movement or lights anywhere along the trajectory path that it would have been on.<n>

I was smoking a cig and sitting in a chair. I leaned my head back and looked up at the sky.  Around a minute or so later I saw a spherically shaped object.  It was probably 800 to 900 feet up it was tiny a little smaller than a fighter jet. from what I could tell.  The object had around 5 to six small looking fins projecting out from the front of the craft sides and back of the craft with faint blue lights flickering.  The spherical shape started to change shape form sphere to a pill shaped with the fins staying in tact.  The object was moving fast from the north west to south east.  The object stopped for a short second then accelerated very fast in the same direction it was heading.  No jet trail was left and even from the ground it was obvious it was not a bird or a plane.  The object made no sound what so ever.<n>
2/19/14 15:00|Tulsa|OK|||((HOAX??))  Multiple witnesses report hearing a very strange sound, emanating from the sky.|2/21/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107307.html|221|ndxe201402| Multiple witnesses report hearing a very strange sound, emanating from the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a first for me, so not sure where or who to report it to and it may be nothing.  I live in a suburb on the outskirts of Tulsa, OK.  This last Wednesday at about 3:00pm, (I know as my son&#39;s bus came during the event) we started hearing the strangest noise we&#39;ve ever heard over my home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We ran outside as did many others, when it did not stop like a normal aircraft passing would.  The cloud cover was immense, but we could tell something was overhead.  Not just loud, but you could feel the pressure change.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A bunch of people went outside as this went on several minutes, and felt like it lasted forever.  I wish I could accurately describe the sound and the way it felt.  My dogs did not bark like they normally would, they went and hid.  Cars were stopping and everyone was trying to see what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The only thing I saw, was after this noise had passed from overhead, I saw 2 fighter jets fly by at a very low altitude right over my house, through a small cloud break.  This noise kept going and going.  If it was some aircraft, it would have to be circling around and around for the entire length of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Even stranger, after, the news here reported at least 12 power transformers spontaneously erupted in fire causing over 1000 people to lose power.  Maybe a coincidence, but weird.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Nothing was mentioned anywhere about the air event, except on Facebook conversations.  My sister in law heard it at her house about 12 miles south, and this was right over my house going in a northeast direction, so it was that loud.  They went out to see what it was there, and couldn&#39;t see anything either.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My other sister in law lives close to my neighborhood, and said she was afraid it was the end of the world and was thinking only about her son at school.  At the grocery store yesterday, I overheard two people talking and one mentioned they thought it could be &#34;haarp&#34; related.  I had to look that up to see exactly what it was.  Whatever it was, it was bizarre and even stranger that the transformers blew up and that nothing was mentioned about it from our news sources.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just wanted to report it somewhere.  Even if it was military maneuvers, it&#39;s worth reporting.  Obviously the military was involved somehow as the 2 jets that were following it could be seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely,<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name deleted))<n>

But they are bright the size is hard I&#39;m going to equate it to a small helicopter cabin because I didn&#39;t see any wings or parts protruding, no sound .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve been searching the sky&#39;s ever since that week but haven&#39;t seen another as of yet.  I hope that someone can discover what these things we are seeing are.<n>

I looked out the window at the top of the stairs I see this large red glowing ball flying towards the house like a plane but this is no plane I&#39;ve ever seen so I scramble to the porch on the other side of the bedroom shouting at my husband to get up and tell me what this thing is.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we go out to see the glowing red/orange ball - there&#39;s 2 of them flying past travelling in a North West direction!  He looks and believes they&#39;re planes while I&#39;m insisting they aren&#39;t planes as there was no sound and the red glow pulsed.  I&#39;m thinking maybe they&#39;re drones of some kind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day I text a friend of mine in Hobe Sound who tells me her children saw the same thing on the Monday and they even frightened her son!<n> <n><n> <n><n> Friday the 21st of February my Husband and I were sitting out the front of the house watching the thunderstorm when the same girlfriend calls me at 11:02 pm.  She is driving from Tequesta to Hobe Sound telling me she&#39;s following another one of these red glowing orbs north on U.S.1.   The traffic ahead of her all have their breaks on looking at the same orb.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hang up with her and lo and behold there&#39;s another one in front of us flying north.  I quickly try to video it and take photos.  The video didn&#39;t come out  but I got a picture.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Saturday the 22nd of February my husband went to walk the dog about 10:00 pm and there they were again!  This time there were two heading North and they lasted around two minutes before blinking and then disappearing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He called my son to look out the window with his friend who also saw it.  The 1 picture I got is the only one any of us managed to get.  My friend&#39;s phone stopped working after trying to video it (maybe unrelated).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wouldn&#39;t have bothered with a report if it was only the  once that I saw them but the multiple sightings and the way they just blink out is something I just can&#39;t explain<n>

Then I grabbed my cell phone to record the scene, but in my panic I forgot to push play.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The strangest thing, it looked to be intelligent, because it slowed down behind the tree tops to where it stayed at of my site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked a few steps to get a view of the orb and it vanished to the clouds.<n>

When I was standing at my vehicle facing W-NW (towards Vienna/Cambridge) I saw what appeared, at first, to be a bright full star due to the similarities between the brightness of the light and apparent light shape except that it was moving slowly from right to left at a slight downward angle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On second guess I assumed it was a shooting star or something of that nature so I stood there for a moment to watch the beauty of the nature when, approximately 10 seconds after first sight, the light made a sharp ~95° turn, accelerated, and dropped from the sky at nearly thrice it&#39;s original speed.  After that my view of that portion of the horizon and sky was obscured by the treeline near my residence.  All in all, I simply do not recollect any such thing that could move in such a way.

Hard to estimate size, since I would first have to estimate altitude…….but I’d say it was lower then an air plane.  Maybe a few hundred feet.  I viewedit for about 10-15 seconds it was traveling west then turned to the South, that’s when it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It looked like it had a wing span, likely V shaped.  No lights what so ever.  It was dark gray in color.  No sound.  It was graceful……it glided utterly silently in the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Wasn’t sure who to report it to.  I haven’t heard anything on the news, radio or internet.  It was so discreet, I now find myself thinking these things could really be out there.  A few of my friends think I’m crazy, and don’t believe me.  No one would see them unless they got luck like me. Creepy.  I did not feel in danger though, it was a very graceful movement.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Does this sound like a military operation/practice??  Maybe a surveillance drone or something??<n>

All 3 briefly became visible at the same time.  First one would blink on, then another, and so on, then one would blink off then back on in random sequence etc.  All three were totally silent, and left no visible smoke, plasma trail or contrail etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While visible, they appeared to have a very low ground speed, however, with no range or size information, I could not determine their exact speed, altitude or location.  They were arranged in an approximate north/south line from my vantage point, looking west southwest toward the fading sunset, and they did not dart or zoom back and forth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were only in view for a few seconds, and I pulled out my cell phone to photograph them, but it was too dark.  All three then blinked out within 30 seconds or so, and I noted the time as 19:16, on my cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having occasionally seen these groups of reddish orange orbs at this location before, I attempted to take a photograph this time, because the sightings appear to be occurring more and more frequently, during the three years I have been wintering over here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is a lot of regular air traffic in this area, from SWA B-737&#39;s, AAL MD-80&#39;s, to CRJ 50 and 700 series commuter jets, plus a lot of G/A traffic going into TUS, and Ryan Airfield, located 10nm South and Marana Airport, about 11nm north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also spot numerous military aircraft over flying this area daily, including KC-135&#39;s, C-130&#39;s, F-16&#39;s, A-10&#39;s, Blackhawks and Cobra helicopters etc., mostly operating out of DM AFB or TUS.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Additionally, both my neighbor and I operate Hot Air balloons, (mine is a Balloon Works AX-8-B,  90,000 cubic feet) so I am quite familiar with the local traffic patterns, and most types of aircraft in this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am also familiar with the difference in color spectrum between tungsten, XENON, HALOGEN, and LED landing lights, and or position/strobe lights, which these orange orbs were not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just prior to this sighting, there was a flight of two A-10 Warthogs, departing Davis Monthan AFB, on their routine evening patrol.   I see them often, and can recognize them by their two distinctive white flashing strobes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The A-10&#39;s were climbing away from my position, westbound, in loose formation, about 250 to 300 knots, at approximately 10,000 feet.  As they disappeared to the west, the orbs appeared behind them, a few minutes later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Shortly after the orbs briefly appeared, and then blinked out, I noticed a small single engine aircraft, southbound, approximately 5 to 10 miles west of my position, around 5 to 7 thousand feet.  I could hear its single engine, and see its steady red position light, as well as its red anti-collision light flashing.  Its ground speed appeared to be 80 to 110 kts but it was too dark to determine the specific type.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This aircraft may be the reason for the orbs blinking out, because it appeared to fly through the same area, shortly after the orbs disappeared.  I continued watching for them to reappear, as I walked about two miles back home (approximately 15 min&#39;s)  By then it was completely dark, and the objects did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the past 3 years, I have seen these objects around half a dozen times, usually in groups of two to five objects, to the west of my home, mostly in the evening, or early morning hours, and generally low on the west southwest horizon, as opposed to overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These internally lit, orange orbs were not parachute flares, balloons, helicopters, fixed wing jets or reciprocating G/A aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They were also not candle powered toy hot air balloons, which my neighbors launch in the evening, from time to time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Having watched the Apollo-17 night launch in person, (DEC 1972), two shuttle launches, and one night shuttle reentry over the South Pacific, (Eileen Collins, Commander), plus a couple of Vandenburg, AFB night missile launches, I am certain these orbs were not chemical powered rockets, either lifting off or on reentry, or the space station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also they are not the Moon or Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Sirius etc. (wrong color, wrong location)  I can reasonably eliminate all the objects, planets, aircraft and vehicles that I have listed in this report, but I cannot identify what these orbs are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After waiting a little over one hour, I called the hotline and made a verbal report to Peter Davenport around 20:42 local time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have not previously made a formal report, due to my position in professional aviation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen these orange orbs often enough to confirm they are not my imagination, and feel that my report should be made now, because the sightings appear to be happening more and more frequently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If I were here full time, and had the time to spend looking, I feel that I could probably spot them fairly often in this area.  (just my speculation)  Because I am actively employed in a professional flying position, I must remain anonymous, however, I am more than willing to speak with an investigator.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for taking my report and I hope it is useful.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My background:  ATP, I started flying early 1970&#39;s; 26,000 + hours.

We stepped into the alley, emptied the cans, and returned to our yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My daughter was walking approximately five feet ahead of me when she stopped and said “what is that?  It can’t be a plane, it’s not moving.”  She was pointing east, from our back yard, at the sky.  The object’s distance from us, had to be less than half a block.  It was clear and visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We get a lot of air traffic in our area, planes heading towards Midway airport.  We are absolutely familiar with what planes look like at night, as well as helicopters.  I myself am a retired law enforcement officer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked at the object she pointed at and observed the same- this object was not moving.  It was static in the night sky, in a cloudless location.  It had white-red oscillating lights, nothing like the lights of an airplane in configuration.  It was horizontal in shape, and flattened.  I assumed we were looking at it side-on.  If I had to guess, it would have been about the same length as a mid-sized vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the object for a full two minutes.  It remained totally, unequivocally stationery.  The temperature outside had to be in the low twenties, and I seriously doubt it was a blimp or other airship.  It made no noise, as we were waiting to hear if we could detect the sound of helicopter blades.  There was absolutely no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After two minutes of observation, I told my daughter to run inside and get my second daughter for another witness.  As my second daughter left, the object dimmed, and vanished.<n>

There were several birds and squirrels, so standing right in my doorway I was looking up at them.  Then I heard what sounded like a large passenger jet I looked up and there was, flying south, at a very high attitude, and then when that was out of site something caught my eye. At first I thought it was a larger bird.  Then I noticed it didn&#39;t flap his wings once as it traveled at a very high speed, from southwest heading north east in a very straight line and steady speed.  It was white in color and weird shaped.  I can&#39;t even really describe but it didn&#39;t look like it like it could fly by the shape of it, and it was dead quiet and next thing I knew it was out of my site cause my house blocked the view and I was in total shock but very excited I got to see that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> t looked about it was off the ground about the same distance helicopters fly, but hard to judge so quickly<n>

I look northward in the sky and observed a cylindrical shaped object expelling smoke from its aft end.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object then did a loop while trailing smoke and I could hear a low rumble similar to that made by rockets ascending from Canaveral Air Station.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first, I thought it might have been a malfunctioning rocket, but this incident was occurring to far west of the beach where the rockets are usually launched.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another indicator that this was not a rocket was that there were 2 high altitude commercial jets flying north to south with one being directly above the object.  The airspace is cleared of all traffic before rocket launches.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After coming out of the loop, the object ceased emitting smoke and travelled west at a high rate of speed before either disappearing or turning due north.  When the object was travelling westerly, it looked like a silver cylinder tapered at both ends.  I could also see what appeared to be dark “portholes” on the side.  I could not see wings or tail fins.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 1100 hrs, I heard the low rumble again and found another dissipating white smoke loop to the northwest, but could not see the object this time.<n>

Went outside to smoke cigarette while food was heating.  I daily look at the night sky and the stars.  The moon was bright.  Sky clear but clouds moving in at distance from the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Very surprised and somewhat shocked,  I saw two amber lights that I first thought were airplanes.  Flying at about the same altitude as planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realized as they moved closer over head there were no blinking lights.  I see a few high altitude planes every night or so.  They appeared to stay an exact distance apart and were gliding slowly.  I was certain that they were not stars because as the moon remained stationary they continued to move close from ESE to WSW.  I then saw a third following somewhat behind further south.  As the clouds came over they were no longer visible.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the clouds broke I was able to see one through the break.  Clouds enveloped again and I could no longer seem them when a large break appeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took some pictures but doubt they came out.  It’s an older camera.  I tried to wake a family member up to corroborate my sighting.  No luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen satellites before and these were too close to be satellites.  I believe that they could have been drones.  Or may have been the proverbial flying saucer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole event lasted about 4-5 minutes.<n>

I also am not usually a star gazer.  However, after seeing two orange, glowing, floating, very close by, orb-like lights; I am convinced that SOMETHING is not right in the Alabama night sky!  I don&#39;t understand how people are dismissing ALMOST ALL of the many reports of these strange lights as Chinese lanterns, planes, jets, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I seen that first night, about four months ago has led me to pay alot more attention to the sky at night especially.  What I have seen EVERY SINGLE NIGHT with the exception of four or five nights (too cloudy to see anything in the sky) has me quite frankly terrified.  I believe there is a huge problem with this rash of strange lights, and why are so many people seeing this stuff, and it&#39;s not in the media, it&#39;s like all being dismissed to the point I wonder about government cover up, but then again, maybe most really believe the dismisal explanations are true.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I have seen EVERY NIGHT, and you can come to Decatur Alabama as well, any night, and see also, cannot possibly be lanterns, you cannot convince me that peoples&#39; lanterns are going in unison type lines together, flashing colors at each other (most the time it&#39;s orange fire looking colored, but also suddenly flashing to red, white, green, or blue) it often looks as if whatever they are the lights are trying to communicate...  But you also can&#39;t convince me that they are planes, seeing how what I am seeing tends to NOT travel much, or else it travels so fast you will miss it if you blink.  These lights seem to me to be in almost the same general areas of the sky every night.  They seem to me to also be &#34;trying&#34; to blend in with star formations like the dippers, and even blending with rooftops and trees as someone else said on the NUFORC pages.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not the only one at my home who has seen the lights above Decatur, my adult nephew has seen them, and like me, he can&#39;t figure out what the lights are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My niece and I both seen multiple of these glowing orb like lights land behind the backyard fence, in our neighbor&#39;s out back yard, late one night, some were not completely landed, as they were simply floating around fence level, some were just above the roofs of houses close by out back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another house, that same night, had what apeared to be a huge, floating fireball just barely above their roof.  My niece and I came inside as things got too weird watching the lights outside, so we went upstairs, leaving the house lights off, and watched out the window for several minutes, as the fireball looking one floated in one spot, and the orange orb ones on the ground in the neighbor&#39;s yard outback, moved ever so slow, then sudden, then slow,  and as the other orange orb looking ones that were floating at what looked like fence! level just sort of would rise and sink, rise and sink....  Trust me I know how this all sounds, I wouldn&#39;t be posting this if I didn&#39;t feel very strongly that these lights are BAD NEWS, if they were nothing of concern why wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t we all just know what is going on, why wouldn&#39;t these lights (which are showing up literally all over the world) be on the news, or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights that stay in the sky at night, the ones that seem to &#34;try&#34; to blend in with the trees and rooftop areas, they are the ones that flash different colors.  Sometimes they seem to stay orange, other times they flash red, blue, white, and I am pretty sure they every now and then flash green.  These lights seem as if they communicate.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once again, I was never a star gazer, and I don&#39;t want to post on a website exactly what: however, I did something I should not have done, and have been scared to go outside and smoke a cigarette at night since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Again, I know how this must sound, I am the last person who I would have expected to now be questioning UFO exisistance, but since NOBODY definatively knows or will say what these lights are for sure, then that factually makes them UNIDENTIFIED, flying lights and or objects.<n>

We are located very close to Keaton Beach Fl. In a heavily wooded area.  As I walked up to look at the shrubs my wife was planting our attention was drawn to the sky by a loud sound of rushing wind.  I expected to see some sort of glider or other aircraft speeding by with the motor off.  I say this because the best description I have for the sound is that it sounded like air rushing very quickly over an object or an object moving very quickly through the air, and this happened with absolutely no motor noise present.  To our amazement what we saw was nothing that we recognized.  Streaking overhead from our right to our left was something approximately the size of a basketball but shaped more oval, or similar to a football shape.  The object was a flat black color and resembled a large football flying sideways.  My wife got a be! tter look at it than I did, and she described it as looking like a black football with a little round thing on each point, and it was traveling sideways as related to how a football travels.  She also described the sound as air being blown thru a turbo charger, but with no motor noise.  The object passed over our heads at just over treetop level, and was moving very fast.  As it passed over us it was also making a hard right hand turn at approximately 90 degrees.  The most amazing thing was that we saw and heard this thing fly over our heads and it had no motor noise and no wings.  As it quickly flew out of site we looked at each other and both said did you see that!  My first thought afterwards was that we had just witnessed some sort of military drone, however if it was, then it utilized a propulsion system and means of lift and flight that we have not been given knowledge of yet.  I feel fortunate and very excited to have been able to witness this with my wife, however now that! I know that things like this are really real; I have a lot mo! re quest ions.  I am also a little angry because now I’m sure that there is much more advanced technology out there, and we don’t have access to it.<n>

No stars were visible.  I noticed the light as I was going to sleep.  Thought it was an airplane at first.  Then saw it &#34;dip&#34; quickly.  Sat up in bed, not trusting my eyes.  Noticed it was quite odd-- not usual colors of airplane lights, and not moving through the sky like a helicopter or plane would; just hovering in one place and sort of &#34;dancing&#34; in the sky.  I got up and went to the window, again in disbelief, wanting to get &#34;a closer look&#34;.  Realized it must be out over the Sound.  It changed from a &#34;watermelon&#34; kind of color to a lime green and then through various phases of color like pale orange.  It continued to make &#34;dips&#34; quickly in the sky and back into place.  I walked to another area of the house to see if I could still see it out other windows; I could.  About 20 mins into watching, the light broke into about 5 small lights which appeared in a perfectly circular pattern,! whorled in a vertical circle, and then appeared as one light again.  I watched this light for approximately 45 minutes.  Attempts to take photos with my cell phone were disgustingly innefectual.  I could not get the phone to focus on the light, only on things nearby.  Suddenly, the light went out like a &#34;blip&#34; and was gone.  I kept waking up through the night to see if it was back.  Nothing.

One being a Indian Sweat Lodge the other being a Christian prayer monastery.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We came to a point to relax on the dyke and view all the stars.  One star in particular caught my attention as it seemed to be a slow moving falling star, and I said to the lady next to me, &#34;watch this.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed to the star and said stop!  As it was directly above us, it stopped. Being a bit freaked out and the others now looking up from the group I said &#34;watch this&#34; and pointed west and I said to the star &#34;move&#34; to continue in the direction it was originally going.  And it did!!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then called it back and it came back, I then said forward pointing always and it did so..  Finally I was pretty freaked out, and the others now too...  I said look you guys and the star shrieked across the sky in a split second disappeared.<n>

2/15/14 21:30|Webster|MA|Unknown|1 minute|Hovering solid and pulsing white lights, Pulsing white and colored lights, Mutliple sightings.|6/4/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/109/S109605.html|287|ndxe201402| Hovering solid and pulsing white lights,  Pulsing white and colored lights,  Mutliple sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have set the &#34;event date&#34; as the approximate date of the last sighting, along with the corresponding approximate duration, time, and location.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first unusual thing I saw was a few days before Halloween. I&#39;m not sure of the exact date. I was traveling Rt. 395 West at approximately 7PM in the Auburn area.  Off to the left about a mile or so away I would guess, a white streak came straight down, appearing close to the ground, and then disappeared.  I thought it could be a meteorite, but thought it unusual that the streak would appear so close to the ground and be perpendicular in relation to the ground.  The streak appeared for about a second or so before disappearing.  There was no flicker or debris trail that I could see, but appeared as a white ball of light with a solid white streak behind it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days after that, I was traveling Route 9 West in Westborough between 5:30 and 6:00PM. I noticed an unusually bright light traveling left to right across the sky. I lost sight of the object as it continued across the sky. I was traveling down Rt. 20 West in the Shrewsbury/Worcester area shortly after. I could see what may have been the same object from a good distance, probably a couple miles or so ahead. As I recall, it was two same-size solid white lights facing outward toward my direction, positioned horizontally to each other with smaller colored lights in the middle that were pulsing. The object remained stationary. The white lights were bright, but did not appear to project an outward beam like a searchlight or headlight. The lights were bright, but did not have a glistening brightness to them like a flashlight might. The brightness was closer to something like a traffic light. The white lights were circular and large. I can only guess at their diameter, but based! on how low it seemed to the ground, I would guess they were at least searchlight-size or larger. At first, I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the position and trajectory of the object in relation to my vehicle that made it seem as if the object wasn&#39;t moving, but as I got closer I could see that it was hovering, maintaining the same position directly above Route 20. I would estimate it to be 500 to 1,000 feet above the ground, but I couldn&#39;t see the shape of it. I ultimately passed directly under it&#39;s position, which was further confirmation that it was hovering in place. I was excited to find out what other people would report, if this would be on the news, etc., as this was during rush hour, and at a minimum, hundreds if not more people would have seen this same low-to-the-ground object. I was very disappointed to find absolutely nothing in the news or anywhere online about the incident. A few days after, on Route 20 West in the Shrewsbury area, also during rush hour, the same or s! imilar object was hovering just to the right of Route 20. This! time it appeared to be lower to the ground, and there were multiple lights both white and colored, but the lights were dimmed to such a degree that you might miss it if you weren&#39;t paying attention. They had a consistent low-light glow, no flickering or blinking that I recall. The object would have been noticeable to anyone traveling in that area, and may have been in a different configuration from the one I had seen days before. I have never seen anything with dimmed lights flying in the sky or hovering above the ground before this, so it was very unusual indeed. Again, I passed by it with it hovering above me off to my right. I can&#39;t speak as to whether the object made any noise either time, as there was moderate to heavy traffic all around, along with the noise produced by my own vehicle. I have seen strange lights in the Route 9 and Route 20 area before, but nothing as noticeable or that was recurring like this. There are planes and helicopters that commonly fly around this are! a, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like or similar to this, and I have been traveling these same routes around the same time, Monday through Friday, for several years.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another few days after the last sighting, I was approaching the on ramp to Route 395 North near Exit 3 in Webster. On approach to the entrance I noticed multiple large white lights that were stationary part way above the tree line. I believe there were four of them. I don&#39;t remember specifically, but I believe two or more lights were pulsing. At the time I thought they may have been night time road work/construction lights or something similar, so I didn&#39;t pay much attention to them, and it didn&#39;t occur to me as unusual until after I turned onto the highway.  Although I had been this way many times, I am not familiar with all areas of the town.  I have since been down the road the trees are adjacent to, and there are no roads in the area or anywhere nearby that align with the top of the trees, and I saw no lights of this kind anywhere.  I have never seen those lights before or since in that area, and have traveled the same way many times since and during the same time of day.  If this were the same object I had seen before, I would guess it&#39;s length across to be 40 to 60 feet across.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Over the next few months I would see this same or very similar configuration of white lights. The next time would be in late December on Route 395 South in the Auburn/Oxford area in the evening around 6:30. The object was to my right and was higher in the sky than I had seen it at other times, but again was relatively low to the ground. I could not see the shape of it, but the configuration of lights was the same, a row of four horizontal, outward facing white lights. I could clearly see the two lights in the middle that remained solid, and the lights on either side pulsed. All lights appeared to be the same size. There may have been a faint colored blinking light near the middle of the white lights. There was also a single pulsing white light that appeared to be close to the row of lights and approaching it from left to right in the sky. The single light was similar in intensity, but I can&#39;t say with any certainty how far it was from the row of lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next time I saw these lights was around 6:30PM on January 9th near and to the left of Route 20 approaching the entrance to Route 395 South in Auburn/Worcester area, but this time there were only two large solid white lights, same configuration, horizontal and outward facing, and again hovering relatively low to the ground. I would see the lights with my wife the next time in the Auburn area in the evening. I believe we were either on Route 20 or had just entered a side road intersecting with it. Same two white lights, same lowness to the ground, and again either motionless or moving very slowly. This is the first time my wife had seen the lights. In late January, early February, I saw the same lights again during my evening commute from the end of the on ramp going from Route 9 to Route 20 West. As I yielded to traffic at the end of the on ramp and looked to the left for traffic before entering, my eyes were drawn upward where I saw the same two white lights. I could onl! y pause for a couple seconds or so, but again the object appeared to be motionless or moving very slowly. I would guess it was about one-half to one mile away, and perhaps a couple thousand feet up. I have seen the moon, basically in the same position in the sky. This was not the moon. The next thing I saw was during my evening commute on February 11th. It was a brief red flash on Route 20 West. It appeared to be a few miles away, and lasted only a moment. It appeared, and then it was gone. From where I was the shape looked like an egg on its side with it going smaller to larger left to right. In the smaller area to the left there was a small white flash. I saw a bright white light in the vicinity of where I believe the flash occurred. It appeared unusually shaped, and I saw it at certain points in the sky for a few minutes as I was heading home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My wife saw the two white lights again while driving on Route 395 within a few days of my last sighting, this time hovering in the vicinity of exit 3. To this date, that is the last time either of us has seen the lights. We never saw the shape of the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am open to the possibility that these occurrences are all explainable as something ordinary, but I also have to consider how unusual and unlikely something like this is - the unusual and similar nature of the lights occurring multiple times in different areas, but within the same 30 mile radius.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was happy to find some similar, and some very similar sightings by others at NUFORC.org, MUFON.com, and YouTube.com.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whether ordinary or extraordinary, I look forward to seeing these lights again, and hope to come to know what they are.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Two were south east of me.  They were one orange glowing ball shaped light and the other was a little different.  It was also a light but wasn’t just one glowing ball, I can’t quite remember how to precisely describe that one.  It was more like a cigar shape maybe.  Both were close to each other and appeared to be hovering or slowly descending a few hundred feet to a few thousand feet in the air approximately a mile to a few miles away from me over what I would guess to be near Gibson Island or so.  The third one was another orange glowing ball or orb shape at approximately the same height and hovering or descending in a similar manner.  It was to the east of me.  If I had to guess I would place it near Curtis bay area or Dundalk.  Saw for approximately one minute until there were below the tree line and no longer in sight and I had to drive back to work.<n>

We also thought of the possibility that it could be the sunset, but then came to the realization that the sun sets in the west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This ball was at least ten times larger than the size of the moon.  We then drove on for another five minutes and planned to take a picture when we stopped driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We arrived at the game and got out to take the picture and it was gone.  It disappeared as fast as it had appeared and had a duration of five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then 2 hours later, after the game, we were driving home in the same direction and checked the sky one last time.  We did not notice a ball but did see a slight orange tint in the sky in the exact same place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We then came home to do research and got to the conclusi! on that it must have been a UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

To my right (east), I saw what appeared to be two silver, flat disk objects moving diagonally up and down in the sky over the hills above the village a little ahead of me off the autobahn.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sky was a dark gray color and it was drizzling rain.  The objects appeared flat and shiny silver and perhaps about dime-sized from my vantage point.  They appeared to have a sort of tail of light that moved with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took my foot off the accelerator to slow down and cleaned my windshield thinking they might be a reflection of some kind but I could still see them after I did that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After maybe 20 seconds or so, trees and terrain obstructed my view, but I looked back in that direction afterward and did not see them again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I saw this, within about a mile, I passed the Potzberg parking rest area.  The surrounding area is rural and includes Wildpark Potzberg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the second time I have reported seeing something like this in my life, as I saw a disk when I was 7 years old near my elementary school in 1977.

Since I was driving the time I had to focus on the objects was limited but was still long enough to notice that this was not a normal occurrence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were emitting a red light, which at first made us think of the lights on top of radio towers.  As we began moving past them on the bypass we noticed that they were not stationary, and in fact were moving east or northeast.  It also became clear that this was not normal due to the close proximity of the lights to one another.  It seemed as if they were moving in almost a V-shaped pattern although it was not clear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Another piece of information that helped prove that we were not just seeing things was the fact that on the eastbound lane of the bypass there were a few cars stopped and with people out with their phones capturing the same thing we had just passed.  At that point though we determined that it would be best to get home and check sources for any possible information on the siting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After not hearing anything over the past few days I figured it would be best to post what I saw and hope that someone else saw it too.<n>

From my location, the estimated distance of the orbs were approximately less than 1 mile at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft.  They moved in tandem, one trailing the other, but still within close proximity of the lead sphere.  They emiited no sound.  At first glance, I thought they could be aircraft approaching RDU Airport, but realized no noise after a few moments had passed, and the light emission was much greater than normal markers and strobes on a typical aircraft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The weather was clear and cold. Stars were clearly visible in the background.  I see a lot of air traffic overhead and am confident in my ability to identify various military and civilian aircraft.  These flying objects did not display any visual or audible characteristics of any military or conventional aircraft.  Conclusion.....UFO&#39;s!  Without a doubt!<n>

I think of a soccer ball, with the black patches being the orange lights and the rest of the white patches being just black.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They hovered over the city area, the first one hovered in the same spot for at least 5 minutes and then began moving to the right.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It only moved in this direction for a minute or so, and then it halted suddenly and at that moment, it ascended up into the sky and disappeared as balloon does when it is released into the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other one followed this same pattern and ascended in the exact location in the sky as the first.  It took about 45 seconds for each one to completely disappear.<n>

I was shoveling snow from my deck at the back of the house after shoveling snow from my driveway in the front of my house.  The front of the house faces almost due east.  I would periodically stop about once every five minutes or so to drink a sip of water and to catch “my breath”.  I looked up (in a north north westerly direction) to admire the clear blue skies when I noticed two “birds” flying very high and moving slowly in a westerly direction.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It struck me as being odd that they we as high as they appeared, not knowing what kind of “white” birds these were or how large they were.  One was about twice as small and appeared to be higher than the other.  Then they began to move in a manner which didn’t fit the movement of birds at all.  I then noticed that didn’t have wings and were white spherical objects, the largest about the size and color of the period on a computer keyboard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The higher one stopped and the lower one continued in the same westerly direction I first noticed them, it then reversed (180 degrees) direction and moved rapidly about 3 degrees in that opposite direction for about one second, it reversed direction again, then again a third time and then it stopped.  While this was happening the second object climbed straight up while they both stopped moving at about the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second object, at the higher altitude (again about one half the size as the other object) would appear then disappear while they both were stopped.  They both remained stopped for about three seconds then they both spiraled upwards and disappeared in less than two seconds.  Unfortunately, I didn’t record the event because:  1) it happened as fast as it did, 2) it took me a moment to realize this was not a couple of birds, 3) I thought I had left my cell phone in another jacket, turns out I did have it, I had put it in my back pocket when I took the jacket off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 5 minutes after these two spherical objects disappeared a high flying jet with one vapor trail passed over flying to the same location as the two objects were.  This jet appeared (best estimate) to be above 45,000 feet, no sound and appearing all white as it flew over such that I could only see the underside of the plane.  The jet appeared to be less than one forth inch long at arm’s length.<n>

Knowing that it was not a star or plane we quickly pulled over to the side of the road.  We saw that it had a very faint triangular shape (which is hard to see in the videos) with a bright light in the middle that occasionally got bigger and put off sort of a blur.  The object basically was staying in the same spot except moving slightly very quickly back and forth and up and down.  After a few minutes we had to go because he was going to be late so upon leaving we noticed the object following us. We pulled over again for a minute and in the beginning of my second video you can see just as we were stopping the object following.  We sit there for a few seconds and then started again and sure enough the object was following again as you can see in the video. When I got close to his work the object had stopped but still in sight. After my ! brother went in to work I proceeded to video some more and this time in the middle of the video as it flashed a kind of blur it made a sound that can be heard. After that I went back home which is about 5 miles but to my surprise as I got out of the car I noticed it again in the now blue morning sky. It was just across from my home high in the sky. I was shocked that it seemed to have followed me back to my house. I decided to quickly get the camcorder in my home and started videoing again and this time I could zoom in closer to get a better look and you can see it zipping back an forth as I watched. In a few minutes it then went slowly higher in the sky and disappeared. I have never seen anything like that before in my life and was kind of shocked at the fact of it following us and then to see it again after returning home was even more strange.<n>

Odessa has an international airport and i often saw many different aircrafts in the sky from my window, but it was something different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The first thing i did was taking my old Nokia 6700 Gold with 5 megapixel camera and began recording but the quality of the video was very poor and there was nothing in sight. I quickly began looking for my Canon EOS 600D with EFS 18-200mm 0.45m/1.5ft and found it at at 6:18 AM GMT+2!  It was too dark and I could not catch the focus for a long time. I started taking pictures of the object and decided to make a video at dawn for a better quality.  The best photos are included in 00:30 - 00:31 range of the video uploaded by me on YouTube.  At dawn i also tried to record the video &amp; was surprised, because when i started doing it the object became dissolve in the sky and a cloud began to form around him.  You can hear a very strange sound in the video when it&#39;s happened.  I will say more, a strange sound was during all this time.  If you look closely you can see how he disappears and after that all around subsides.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Location: Odessa, Ukraine.

If there are any they are not this bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object seems to float there and it&#39;s not an airplane because it has remained stagnate for at least 30 min and more.  The light on it is bright and there looks as if there&#39;s another light going around it.  It is not a helicopter because of the wind and it would still be moving in someway or another.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There is only one and its shape is hard to tell since it&#39;s just one light but looks there are multiple lights moving around it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A little about the observer is that I have never seen a UFO and not really a believer in aliens but I felt like this needed to reported to possibly help support someone else&#39;s observation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also I wanted to be able to report this because it looks out of the ordinary and wanted to share it.<n>

There was no sound and they slowly gained elevation finally fading through the cloud cover.  The entire event lasted about 4 minutes.  After the first two orbs faded out of sight I took a picture of the last glowing orb.<n>

It was coming from behind the tree across the street when I first saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought maybe it was a plane or helicopter, but there was no sound and the light was solid and there were no other lights flashing around it.  It was large and oblong in shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It slowed down to less than half the speed it was traveling and then another light, exactly like it followed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As the second light got closer to the first, they both began moving north at the same speed.  They stopped and hovered in place.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran into the house to get my phone so I could record it.  My parents stayed outside and watched the lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I came back outside, I began recording the lights.  The first light faded out, followed by the second light shortly after.

I was just getting ready for bed when I glanced out of my bedroom window.  My first glance was a bright white light that was a star.  Looked to to see if I could figure out constellation it was, and noticed numerous white lights moving westward.  They were higher in the night sky because below them were two airplanes.  The planes flew right underneath three of the lights but there were no indications the pilots seen the objects.  The objects that were in the plane&#39;s path moved quickly away while the others kept moving in a westward direction.  I opened my windows to see if I could hear anything after the planes went by but there was absolutely no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some of the objects went from white to orange back to white lights and traveled towards the Pintlar Mountain Range.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I couldn&#39;t begin to count the lights there were so many and then they would simply disappear and some would move towards other lights.  There was no formations just moving westward.  I grabbed my binoculars but they were all moving pretty fast. I attempted to keep my eyes on two of them towards the back but it was  difficult because they moved around a lot from left to right and then just disappeared.<n>

I then realized that there was a light cloud layer behind it and it was getting closer.  It was very large and bright.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Its distance was about 1/2 mile and several thousand feet in elevation.  I called my wife and we both observed it for about an additional minute until it accelerated off to the north east and disappeared.<n>

I had seen a white light far away behind the clouds. It was like seeing a normal aircraft.  Except it was moveing fast especially for being so far away. I lost sight of it at times because of the clouds.  Then saw it in another spot in a completley wrong flight of path for any of our known aircraft.  It would move in another direction and it would jump around.  It wasn&#39;t because of the clouds.  The clouds were moving and not even there at some points.<n>

It was moving too slowly to be an aircraft, but it appeared to be 700-1000 feet from where we were.  We pulled over and watched it for a few moments and it slowly moved on and disappeared.<n>

The object was a light silver color and was visible for only 3-4 seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat at the intersection for over a minute to see if it would reappear but it did not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was very obvious to the naked eye.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have no idea where it went or what it was.<n>

It never left its position in the sky, but I could see it get brighter and dim.

Afterward, I decided I wanted a cigarette.  It was just before daybreak when I went outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was standing on my back porch, I saw a light that I thought was a star at first, then I figured that it was too bright to be a star, and it seemed way to close to be a star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a minute of watching, I noticed there were no red or green blinking lights.  Even more, I noticed that there was no noise coming from it that you normally would hear.  I began to video tape this on my cell phone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I recorded, I noticed that &#34;it&#34; was moving around very quickly from side to side.  During the recording, you can hear the neighbors dog howl twice.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I still do not know what I saw but I know it was not a normal aircraft that is used day to day.<n>

I looked at it with my naked eye for about 10 minutes and observed that the light was staying in one place without moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went and got my boyfriend who was in the shower getting ready for work.  He suggested that we get my binoculars out and look at the light with them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What we saw was so clear through the binoculars that we both had to sit down for a minute out of pure shock.  It was a saucer shaped craft, more like an egg laying on its side.  There were windows all across the center of the craft, where the light was shining through.  The light was super bright, and white or yellowish in color.  The craft appeared to be brown or grayish in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both took turns watching it for over 2 hours, during which the sun came up over the horizon.  The craft did not move from the one spot except very slightly coming closer to us and then going back to its original position.  I tried to film it on my cell phone, but my camera on my phone was not able to zoom in enough to get a clear image.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both watched the craft change shapes before our eyes into some sort of leaf-like shape, and then it ever so slowly, moved directly up into the sky until it was a small bright light too high up to identify anymore.  The most amazing part of this is that we have now seen it every morning for 7 days in a row.  With only very slight differences in exact position in the sky, and we have now captured video on two different video cameras.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both know that this was not a star or planet because we clearly watched the stars move right past the craft which remained stationary.  We also observed several planes come within range of the craft and fly right past it, the difference in size of the planes versus the craft we were watching was immense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft appeared to be 50 times the size of the planes.  There have now also been 2 more witnesses, my roommate and her boyfriend who brought over the best video camera yet to film what we! had all been witnessing every night for a week.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I expect that it will be there again tonight, and I plan on watching it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I myself am currently a law student, my boyfriend is a construction worker, my roommate is retired and her boyfriend is a large engine mechanic.  We range in age from 30-58 years of age.<n>

I witnessed 4 bright &#34;flaming&#34; red lights moving from west to east across the sky.  They were in random positions and seemed to slowly fade out of sight when they disappeared from view.  Some were moving more vertical and some more horizontal than others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The objects were traveling at least as fast or faster than any commercial aircraft I see in the area.  As these first 4 objects were moving and fading from sight at different times, 2 more came up over the horizon and followed a similar path.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother pulled up at this moment and we watched the objects as he filmed one with his camera.  The footage did not turn out very well due to lighting and camera quality.  Another 2 objects came up over the horizon from a different position approximately 5 miles away fro where the others originated and moved over the sky on my other side.  I had to turn 180 degrees to watch them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got my neighbors outside and they got to see the last one as well.  The objects maintained a steady trajectory with only a smooth change from vertical to horizontal.  As far as backgrounds my brother and I are both college educated civilians.<n>

On the evening of February 11, 2014 between 23:45 and 24:00 hours, I observed very bright orange spheres appear and disappear 270 degrees west about 10 degrees above the western horizon.  The first 6 objects were about the size of a tennis ball.  They would appear and disappear at the same spot above the horizon.  They would appear and disappear about 1 to 2 minutes apart and within 5 degrees of each other.  They did not rise and fall like throwing a ball into the air.   They appeared 7 different times.  The orange objects appeared to be very far away (50+ miles).<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the middle of the appearances I heard and felt a sonic boom.  It shook our house.  That was the only noise I heard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last time the bright orange light appeared it was much closer and 20 degrees above the horizon and moving slowly Southwest to Southeast.  It first appeared about 235 degrees in the southwest.  This time I could see behind the bright orange sphere a long tail of orange embers trailing behind.  The embers didn’t appear to be falling but they just trailed off directly behind the object sort of like a comet.  This time the light was pulsating for 10-12 seconds and then it went dark.  It was about the size of a basketball thus it appeared much closer and brighter than the first 6 sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the Iron County Sheriff’s office to report it and see if anyone else had seen it.   Apparently I’m the only one who observed it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Almost exactly an hour later at 1:48 Mountain Standard Time two jets flew over one directly behind the first.  They came from exactly where the first 6 orange lights first appeared to the west and flew directly northeast on a 45 degree bearing.<n>

Looking West, I saw what looked like a helicopter with a search light coming towards me heading East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it got closer, I saw that it wasn&#39;t a helicopter but a triangle (as far as my eyes could make out) aircraft moving at a relatively slow speed.  The truly odd thing about it was that it had 3 lights along the end of it.  Two on the back points of the triangle and one in the middle of the back that was noticeably brighter than the other two.  It flew over head, slowly, heading East.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Across from our house is a very very smal|2/14/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107087.html|358|ndxe201402| I have always seen this star shining bright from our bedroom window facing east of our home.  Across from our house is a very very small pond and hardly holds water.  Then you see a field with no cattle.  The first time we actually used the binoculars last week and saw square bright white windows straight across from left to right.  My husband thought it was a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I was skeptic until another helicopter went over the house.  They fly at least twice a month.  Helicopters have always flown over our house at night and not a typical sounding aircraft.  I couldn&#39;t see anything but could hear a disturbing loud noise that drowned out our T.V..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then decided to look outside again and this time I saw a colored light in the middle of the squared white lights and looked kind of like a police light but with different colors spinning around.  There are 3 windows on each side of the colored police light and a total of 6.  The window on each side of this craft seems to wrap around.  So I really only see 2 1/2 windows on each side of the police light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Last month my husband and I again were watching T.V. and heard cows that were drowning out the sound of our T.V. one block west from our house around 20:00 pm.  I told my husband I was going to take a drive down the street and I rolled my windows down and could here them really loud like something was bothering them.  Also, I saw that 3 neighbors had their backyard lights on that faced the pasture and farm.  It was unusual for the neighbors to keep their lights on like that because even in the summer when we ride bikes every other night we never seen them on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I just took another look out the window and they moved south from where they were.<n>

Me and my car pool buddy had just got into evansville from 41 when we saw what we thought was a helicopter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But as we got closer we noticed it was slow moving and was to big for a helicopter.  It had a bunch of lights. I saw that it was all grey with no markings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a cylinder shape.  I thought maybe it was a blimp.  But I checked the news and the internet and I found nothing on a blimp being flown around evansville.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I asked around to see if any one knew of any activities going on in town but everyone I talked to said no.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s also odd that a blimp is flying around because it&#39;s been in the negatives.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can you help figure this out.<n>

They dropped off the bike and we were talking, then I noticed an air craft black as black and very long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This craft had a small white light on the front tip and at the end a red blinking light.  It may be military, but not sure, moved very smoothly and sounded really quiet but jet like under tone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a very low flying craft perhaps 500ft above us or so, maybe triangular, but so dark I couldn’t make out a shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have lived in this area my whole life and have seen many planes fly over since I live so close to Tampa and Clearwater.  I have also seen many military helicopters fly over and this just sounded, looked and felt different.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Can anyone confirm what I saw this past week?<n>

The red was basically pure red.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Half an hour later I saw four other red lights, also very bright and pure red.  Absolutely no other lights like you would expect on a plane for example.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Weather was a solid cloud cover.  No stars visible.  There was absolutely no sound whatsoever in both sightings.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of the objects was rather slow, slow enough for me to be able to use my smart phone to take two pictures (basically standard what&#39;s in the picture result) of one of the brightest objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Could they be flares? I would be stunned if they were because of the way they passed by.  They didn&#39;t flicker.  As for the color it was a steady red.  I was looking north and objects went from east to west.  The first object was very high when I saw it but the objects in second sightings were low and then climbed in altitude.  When they would finally go out of sight, I suspect it wasn&#39;t because of distance but rather because they were entering the cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About the speed.  At first I thought it might be a helicopter but like I said above there was absolutely no sound and If I go by how bright those lights were it would have been impossible not to hear at least one of those objects.  As for position lights they would have also been impossible to miss.  Almost forgot but there were three other people that saw the second sighting at the same time I did.  Their reaction was rather surprising. Instead of taking the time to look at the objects they &#34;laughed them away&#34;.  Go figure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, I hope that helps.<n>

I am a keen star gazer and know where things are sposed to be so when I saw the two lights I grabbed my camer for a closer look, when I captured numerous images I found that the brightest light was a cylidrical shape craft with a halo around it with 3 points of connection to the cylider the other image of the light from the moon was not clear enough to make out but it merged with the other light then spead off into darkness.  The following evening around the same time I looked up again to see the light had returned but was moving slowly up and down in a zig zag pattern and was joined by 5+ more lights spaced evenly around the moon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have checked the image I caught with every craft man has in space currently and nothing even came close.

Took a stronger look, and seen a huge triangle shape  2 lights at the end and one in the front with a strong bright red light that did not blink or flashed...  the craft did not make any sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> when the craft passed my house and  crost the moons light i can see the outline and dame was it huge...  it just floated across the sky..    doing north .  I continued watching it  until i could not see it , yet could still see the bright red light  ..   then two  white light object&#39;s  followed the same path , they did not make any sound as well.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> So wired.

It was high above the lake and moving downward.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought it was a shooting star, but it was moving too slowly and the orb stayed circular and appeared to have a haze around it.  As it got closer to the tree line across the lake, a round red light appeared at the bottom of the orb (but was not flashing).  The orb then started moving very quickly before disappearing.  The whole incident lasted about 7 seconds.  I am certain this was not a shooting star or aircraft.<n>

I first noticed it about 2 yrs ago.  There is another one always in the distance that flashes possible 3 different color lights but moves simaler.  The prominent one that moves very very smooth but fast is extremely bright and  seems like it may have a number of lights but three for sure that give of a upward,pointed triangular hue or glow.   Pls can some one concern this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also in the wee hr&#39;s closer to daylight I&#39;ve been a witness to on three separate occasions all times with someone else present who as well seen it this thing has just taken off moving like a satelite but too close to be one in a straight semi fast slower than a satilite moves and leavs towards chillawack mountains each time like a floating white ball. Also one even! ing about 1 or 2 am i was playing my light game with it flashing my ph and i herd this extremly loud bang or idont know how to quite discribe it but just as i herd this noise a large rectangle shape shot out of the sky from  very close by this thing and looked very much like what happens when u microwave a electronic device bright flases of greens,oranges, &amp; yellowish color almost neonish.  And it shot out of the sky incredibly fast only visible for a guick second with a bang type noise as it emerged and a clangy thumpy zoom.heading on a very steep angel downwards.  Then bang and right following Its dissapearence a house alarm went off. It was the neatist thing I&#39;ve ever witnessd.  But quite scary as well.  Also on two separate ocassions I have been in some strange cylinder type dome.  Once in the presence of a friend and once on the pH with that same friend. If you can imagine feeling totally fine vision body and mind and suddenly while still feeling OK the whole duration of th! is experience you are surrounded by a which I try to explain :!  Imagine you were to take many stings of led lights the type that are incased like a hose and make a tube out of them place yourself inside of that tube now totally surrounding u is many Lights all white and each row is spinning but First row spinning clockwise next row spinning counter clockwise.  And they are almost liquidy looking position like a tube(hula hoop) not a tunnel u would walk or drive threw.  Any ways that is a very strange and bazaar experence unlike any drug I have ever tried.  And i was totally 100% not under the influence of any mind altering or mood altering drugs or meds during any of these experiences can someone please communicate with me about any of this data.<n>

I noticed a row of maybe 5 red lights in the sky that were so perfectly vertical that at first I thought it was a constellation.  Then I noticed another red light approaching the row from the left of the others and it joined the row at the bottom.  That&#39;s when I turned off the radio and asked my sister if she thought the lights in the sky were as strange as I did.  She agreed, so I grabbed my phone and we fumbled nervously to record what we saw.  Besides the fact that my sister didn&#39;t know how to work the video camera on my phone, the lights were difficult to record because they seemed to move without really moving.  I don&#39;t know how to explain it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once they were in a row, the lights turned from red to orange and kept changing colors.  They never seemed to move but somehow disappeared.  We never heard any noises like we would have if it was a plane or several planes, which we hear often because we live in between a navy base and a commerce center for private/commercial planes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got home, I called the non emergency line for our sheriffs office to inquire if there had been any other reports.  I was told no but they would send out an officer if I wanted to file a report.  I declined the report.<n>

As for the exact date, I may be off by a day either direction but it was during a snow storm that hit this area dropping a foot of snow over a few days (first week of Feb 2014).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was late in the night, my best guess would be 10:30-11:00pm.  The snow was coming down pretty good and the cloud cover was very low.  I was sitting in my house when I heard a loud but muffled boom coming from the direction of my neighbors house behind me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then about 10-15 seconds later, I heard the exact same sound once again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, I got up from what I was doing and decided to go take a look outside to see what this noise was coming from.  I went outside on my porch, took a look around but did not see anything out of the ordinary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then left the covered area of my porch and started walking outside and as soon as I got to the bottom step of my porch, I looked up into the sky and saw a bright red light hovering just below the cloud layer directly above me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first it almost appeared to be an emergency flare but it just stayed in one spot, had no direction of travel at all.  Being former military, I am pretty familiar with the different style and type flares used and I have never seen one do what I saw that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For about 10-15 seconds it stayed motionless just below the cloud layer, emitting a bright red glow from the objecs which was lighting up the bottom of the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What happened next is the reason why I know this wasn&#39;t an emergency flare:  the object then shot upwards through the clouds at a decent rate of speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was the last visual contact I had with this object and haven&#39;t seen it or anything like it since that night. Besides the boom prior to the visual sighting (unknown if related), no sound was associated with this object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The light was shining on the French doors.  I opened the French doors and followed the light into the living room, the light was on front of the house, shining through the front room window.  When I went closer to window to look, I thought it may have been a police car or someone using a red flash light. Nothing was outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point we were trying to find some kind of explanation and thought it may be the TV reflecting on the doors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a few minutes the same exact red light on door shined on the same window that it had in the front of the house.  We stopped the movie playing on TV.  We turned on the lights in the front and rear of house.  We checked, for footprints, but there were no foot prints in snow nor was there any sign of anything within 200 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I turned off the lights outside, and sat back down to watch TV.   Again, within a few more minutes my wife saw the lights reflecting off one of our mirrors moving up and down.  This mirror is in the middle of house next to the French doors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We called our daughter from upstairs and told her what we saw, she was scared she thought it may be ghost or some of the neighborhood kids outside, but we told her that there is no sign of foot prints in snow and how it was 18F temperature outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Our house is set back at least 150 feet from street (which is a private drive) and 200 feet away in the back from the woods, additionally, no house is behind our property.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the 4th time again I saw same light in the middle of room  shining on the French doors for few seconds,  I tried to show my daughter but as soon as the light came it was gone.  This all happened within a 15-20 minute time frame.  I don’t know where the source was coming from and there was no beam showing, these lights were moving like someone was holding a flashlight moving it sideways and up and down in motion.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called the local police this morning to see if any other person in the area reported such lights.  They said no.<n>

Four or five were very close together and could be covered by two fingers held at arms length.  One was lower in the sky about 4 fingers width.  And two or three others were within a hand width of the main cluster.  They were at a bearing of about 80 degrees from my zip code and roughly 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon.  I am an engineer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen numerous planes lined up to approach a large airport (like Las Vegas or Dulles) and this formation did not resemble anything like that.  In addition they were gone when I stopped the car at home 90 seconds later to get a better look.  They all appeared roughly stationary.  I was driving our car east and was near home.  Once I got home, I hurried to get some binoculars and ran upstairs and they had all disappeared except one and it faded shortly after I found it in the binoculars.  I have never seen lights I could not explain and I believe these must have been military, but I have no idea what they were since they didn&#39;t have the light characteristics of a helicopter and were too stationary for planes.  I expected to find an explanation in the news this morning and reports of other people seeing the same thing, but when I didn&#39;t, I was surprised and decided to post the sighting here.  As an engineer with a technical background in physics I believe visits from a foreign world are impossible to our planet.  These had an earthly origin, but I have no idea what it was.<n>

It then slowly descended in a different direction moving in rotating motion.  The two orange air crafts followed it.<n>

I would describe it as a rather large triangle with a number of orange lights on the  entire perimeter and a larger more intense red light directly in the middle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The middle red light appeared to be pulsing somewhat as it faded slowly in and out- the orange perimiter lights remained constant.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The speed of this craft was impressive and covered the entire expanse of my northern view from the west hemisphere all the way to the visible east hemisphere.  It moved in a rather erratic manner and changed elevation several times as it moved.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say that the height of the craft was lower than an Air Force Jet would fly- yet higher than a smaller personal aircraft (such as a two to four seater).  There were very clear conditions this morning- and I could clearly see the stars and planets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was illuminated brightly and would have been hard for anyone to miss!  My rural home is approx 15 miles north of Madison WI.  There is an Air Force base at Truax Field in Madison.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I noticed a number of Air Force jets patrolling this area within 5 to 10 minutes of my sighting!  They covered the area for about a half an hour traveling the same approximate route (back and forth) as the craft I witnessed.  It was a stunning sighting for me!<n> <n><n> <n><n> I keep my eyes skyward at night- and this was the most impressive thing I have witnessed over the past few years!<n>

They have red, white, blue,and green lights that pulsate and swirl around the sphere itself.  Some nights they are very large, therefore appearing close to Earth.  At times they appear to turn to and fro.  There are many of them in our sky and some appear to form a large circle with much space between them like a dot to dot color book. Others are in triangles or hide inside of constellations.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This will sound silly to most, however, try waving wildly at one of them (as if they are your friend and you&#39;re very happy to see them) and see what you get in return.  I&#39;ve asked several people including one person on the phone who did so as I waited for them.  The results will shock or intrigue you; perhaps both.  The result will be that they flash faster and brighter as if to answer you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

After approximately 5 minutes object wobbled and revealed a triangle shape outlined in red lights.  Observed this for a few minutes and then object must have moved, revealing row of lights.  This back and forth between row of lights and triangle continued for about 15 minutes.  Also observed what might have been a discharge of a ball of light from object.  Couldn&#39;t see if it reached ground as view was obscured by neighboring house.  Lights would get very bright and then dim.  After about 25 minutes, object appeared to be moving either farther away or farther up in sky then disappeared.  Got up about 40 minutes later and looked out bedroom window, again.  Observed what appeared to be a row of lights but way up in sky above where object was originally observed.  Also saw another bright light farther to west over Santa Monica Mountains but clouds were moving in and obscured any further observation.

All six faded and disappeared, but did not change position in the sky before vanishing (ie, did not disappear over horizon).  No clouds, completely clear out and plenty of stars visible.  Have short video clip of them showing shift in positions, but had hard time focusing due to it being dark out.<n>

At first I thought they were like those Chinese lanterns but they were slowly going down and were too big and bright and they weren’t twinkling like a fire would have appeared.  They kept solidly lit(idk how else to put that but I think you know what I mean).  I would estimate they were above somewhere between Bodkin point and Gibson Island because they were to the east or south east of where I was which was Edwin Raynor Blvd heading south.  They were close to each other and slowly descended until they were below the horizon of the trees in front of me.  Surely other people must have seen this.  Time seen was 8:55 pm est and my location was Edwin raynor Blvd and the objects were in front of me and to the left which would put them south east of me since I was heading south.<n>

Just before entering city limits, I noticed two orange lights in the northeast sky.  They were not blinking as airplanes do, and they were close together.  They appeared to remain parallel; it almost suggested they were flying in a formation.  As we continued east into town, I noticed a third orange light to my right (the southern sky).  We watched this light cross our path above us, flying from south to north.  At first we thought maybe it was a meteor, but the brightness was consistent.  It was fast, but not super-fast, just steady. We wondered if it was joining the other two lights.  By this time, the other two lights disappeared.  We watched the third light for about 30 seconds to a minute before it disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The observers are college-educated professionals; one a business-owner, the other a university professor.  This is our first sighting of an unidentified object.  It was so strange and unexplained that I felt compelled to report it to someone.<n>

The structure had no wings and in trying to describe it to each other we all three agreed that it resembled a dragon fly with no wings.

It was about 4 inches in diameter at that distance, fluorescent, or sparkly green, with maybe a slight trail but nothing significant registered in that 2 to 3 seconds.

The sky was blue, and open without cloud cover.  I was moving slow with traffic when I saw an extremely bright white light moving extremely fast across the sky from left to right, or East to West.  It was moving so fast I thought it was a meteor.  The light then changed from bright white to extremely bright green, and then disappeared.  It traveled over the mountain where I live, well above the horizon and in a horizontal line or possibly a slight decent.  The total time I saw it was about two seconds (2 seconds).  The shape appeared triangular.  There was no debris, no contral like a plane, and no flames.  The white light seemed to trail behind it momentarily then it turned bright green and disappeared.  I searched the sky and could not find anything at all, it was gone.<n>

Neither of the people in the car noticed the objects; later revealed to them only by analysis of the two photos.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One Photos shows what looks like on disk with a twin rotating (DNA like) Vortex tail following the disk.  The disk has an eerie (Newton&#39;s Rings-Like) Diffracted-light aura that appears to be a partially effective cloaking device using perhaps meta-material-like alterations to the surrounding air by induction of alternate layers of air negative refractive index with layers of air with normal positive refractive index.  The vortex tail also shows some evidence of cloaking effects near the disk.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The second photo contains what appears to be a partially cloaked Mother-Ship in the process of simultaneously ejecting two disks in a &#34;Center of Gravity-Matter Shepparding Twin Vortex with both ejected ships directed downward before separating tangentially and flying away from each other at 180 degree angles mutually orthogonal to the downward ejection spiral.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A twin spiral trail also follows both ejected disks and quite possibly directs their orderly ejection from the Mother-Ship and orderly separation from each other.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The secondary dual spiral beams are shown both trailing and leading (or even Guiding) one of the two ejected disks, and perhaps are guiding both disks initially in the ejection phase.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe the atmospheric conditions were just right with low temperatures at 7600 FT altitude combined with high dew points than allowed these two photographs to detect subtle differences in air density, causing unusually large changes in atmospheric opacity near the dew point.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These slight changes may well have been more apparent at near infrared frequencies and thus the I-Phone camera may have thus partially de-cloaked these events which went unnoticed by four human naked eyes, and two human brains.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the party who submitted the report, and requested of him that he have the actual eyewitnesses submit a written report, as well.

Time of encounter:  Feb. 7, 2014.  9:15 pm  EST.   (3 hrs difference, 12:15 am local time FEB 8, 2014)<n> <n><n> <n><n> Please keep in mind the following:  This is NOT A HOAX.  However, the people in Lavras, Br. live in fear of such encounters.  Due to possible military action, knocking on their doors etc.  Or others (CIA?)  Not certain.  But over the years, some not so great things have happened to people concerning this topic.  Including the mysterious death of 3 UFOLOGISTS January 2014 in Brazil.  Don`t know any details concerning this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We are in Northern Ontario, Canada.  (we were not there!)  This is relayed as a third party, after my wife`s version from her friend and through some translation from Portuguese.  My wife has a friend from an online UFO site.   This friend lives in Lavras, BR.  Fifteen (15) people were outside socializing when they saw the folllowing:  * A light and dark purple craft with flashing lights,  hovering and moving across the sky.  Not certain of the distance, but was lead to believe a distance of 1 or 2 kms.  This is a hilly semi-mountainous region.  The craft was spitting large light particles,  behind apartment buildings, next to a hill on the edge of town.   Then an explosion.  They instantly assumed the craft crashed.  This was relayed to my wife online, within 10 minutes of the incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> UFO CRASH!   UFO CRASH!!  Was the heading and message.    And us,  being 8,000 miles away,  obviously cannot be certain what happened.   I personally put this on 3 UFO sites of which i am a member, within minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the excitement started as you can imagine.  But something came down.    I asked about photos, the girls name and phone no.  etc...but got little cooperation.  They are very fearful of getting involved, which is most unfortunate.  I kept asking questions but received no additional information.<n> <n><n> <n><n> However, the next day we resumed contact with this girl.  Or my wife did.   The Brazilian lady continued to believe a UFO crashed.  Others in her group verbalized that they thought that maybe it was some sort of probe that fell off the craft and exploded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Something exploded!  That is certain.   No one ventured to the site!!   LIke i personally would have done.  Even the night of this incident.   I have little fear.  But this is not the case with these people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> *Also very important to note:   The following night, some of these people, as reported by the same woman,   (online through the UFO site)  saw several lights in the sky moving very close to this incident.   ET friends checking out the area?  I think so.   SOMETHING  DEFINITELY CAME DOWN.   Some have said this area is full of similar things, and that ET`s live inside the hills or mountains.  Odd that there were no photos.  Perhaps it happened quickly,  it was dark,  perhaps their cell phones were inside the house or building at the time?   Or perhaps this area does not have many people with cell phones.   Brazil in many areas are not US or Canada, where everyone has the latest technology in their back pocket.   I don`t know why no photos, we can only speculate.  But i feel 95% certain something came down and exploded.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is about it.   Wish there were photos and a first hand description for you.   Not possible at this time.   *My wife wants no involvement.   (as a permanent landed immigrant in Canada recently, wants nothing to do with it)  So there you go.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The circle was completely black, with no lights and no reflections of the lights below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I live a mile west of the Las Vegas Strip, near the Palace Station casino.  The object seemed to be following Sahara Boulevard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched it for 20 seconds or so,  until my view was obstructed by trees.  I was unable to determine how high it was in the sky, or how large it was.  However, it appeared to be skirting the base of the clouds.  Because it was raining lightly, the clouds were lower than normal.  Several times it looked to me as if the object disappeared into the clouds for brief instants.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because of the light storm, wind was to the east.  The object was moving in a straight line into the wind, which immediately seemed odd to me.  I don&#39;t think a balloon would have traveled in a straight course against the wind.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Less than a minute later, a helicopter traveled the same course, from east to west.  The helicopter was traveling at appx. the same speed as the object had been.  I could not tell if the helicopter was a news copter, a police copter, or some other type.  It wouldn&#39;t have been a tourist helicopter because they are restricted to the Strip.<n>

I thought for a moment that a protrusion had possibly unrolled on the craft directly toward my eye, but as the craft moved past, I could see no change in its profile.  The effect remained for the very brief time the vehicle was in sight.  It affected the entire side of the craft, but I was unable to see if it extended above or below.  There was no evidence of exhaust behind the craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle was moving very rapidly at a low altitude for this area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> AM radio had several bursts of high-speed Morse-like code on lower bands.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was followed several minutes later by several choppers in the same direction, too high to make out any features other than that they were dark (not typical light-colored medevac helicopters of this area).<n>

I made a similar report on Dec. 26, 2013.  In that case a solid object was observed after the glare abated.  This time the glare itself took flight slowly and moved off into a gorge in the mountain.  This sighting was on different peak of the same mountain but close by.  At first sighting the object was stationery prior to flying into the gorge.  I do not suspect a helicopter.  No aircraft would be in that position on this obscure mountain or make such a dangerous flight.<n>

I know we have a airbase near by but it was closer then all the other planes we seen and all I could see were 4 bright lights I seen the other airships fly at night so I would think I would be able to recognize them but nothing seemed familiar to all the air crafts I seen at the base also my relatives seen the same thing but during a different time and date they said that they seen four lights start to go strait down and then tilt then it disappear.  But the lights where bright white lights and with the air crafts in the airbase they always have a blinking light and make noise but this one was just 4 lights no noise and hovering and turning<n>

I wonder how the object can see considering thereis a freeze rite now in there are thick clouds.  I took a little cell phone video for myself but the object is probably not to visible in the low light of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Keep in mind this object was a very bright ball of orange light and appeared to just hover or float across the sky until it graduelly faded away into the distance of the clouds.<n>

The object was moon-like in appearance minus the shadows, and was clearly in front of the thin layer of clouds and sunrays which were behind and above the object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very bright, glowing, light gold with a very smooth surface -luminescent rather than metallic.  It appeared to be solid – light was not reflecting through it.  Size is difficult to guess, altho it seemed to be quite large and about a 45 degree angle above the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No clue as to distance or height, however, it was close enough to see details.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Outline of object was distinct with sky behind darker than object itself.  It remained stationary, but appeared to turn and change to a slightly faceted shape with what appeared to be two small triangular fins one above the other, protruding from behind.  The fins appeared to be of the same material and color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I continued driving SW toward the object, I saw a very small, very black spot which at first appeared and disappeared so I wasn’t sure if I actually was seeing it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The black spot appeared to expand until it was very clearly a rectangular shape located on the lower right quadrant (from my viewpoint).  It remained visible, but rectangular shape appeared to change to an hour glass shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object remained stationary, but the descending sun made it more and more difficult to view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this point, the terrain obscured my view as I drove behind and up up a small hill.  At the top of the hill (about a minute later), I had full view of the SW sky and the object was gone.<n>

The noise was coming from right above our house and it shook our room.  My father was an airplane pilot and we have airplane&#39;s and helicopter&#39;s that go over our house frequently.  So, I am very familiar with the noises that they make when they travel over the air space above our home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I knew right away that this was no airplane because I grew up around airplanes as my dad was a pilot.  The noise startled me because I never, ever had heard anything like that before in our area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got up looked out our large bay window from the 2nd floor of our house and couldn&#39;t believe what I saw.  I saw an object that was changing colors that was hovering and like floating westbound through the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My husband and son also got up and witnessed the object, and they couldn&#39;t believe what we were seeing.  The object changed colors from a beautiful emerald green, red, blue, orange and also to a white color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were so surprised to see such an object right in front of our own eyes that was so beautiful just traveling slowly through the air westbound towards Seattle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it and watched it, of all times none of our cameras were working.  While watching it at one point we did witness what appeared to be a helicopter approach the object.  They kept their distance from the object, they didn&#39;t get close to it.  The helicopter stayed back from it, again didn&#39;t get close to it at all and it finally it backed off and left the object alone.  The object appeared to be larger than the helicopter but not by much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object just seemed to hover in the sky slowly moving westbound.  We watched the object until we could no longer see it any longer.  We were shocked to see such an unbelievable site, and we have always been uncertain about if there are UFO&#39;s in the world or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing th! is AMAZING BEAUTIFUL OBJECT, the three of us that watched it for the a pp. 44 minutes are believers!!  We would of never ever had the opportunity to witness such an unbelievable, AWESOME, site it the noise it had made when it was traveling through the sky hadn&#39;t awoken me again at about 2:00 AM, when we normally are sleeping.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We felt excited, had so many questions that we will never have answered and we did feel somewhat scared, as the questions go on and on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the end we felt very blessed to see such a site, and again we now are believers in UFO&#39;s as our family had just seen one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It shook our room and the noise was unbelievable.  Without the noise that it made in passing through the sky in the middle of the night, we would never ever witnessed such an astonishing site of a object that appeared to be a real UFO!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found her to be quite eloquent and serious-minded.  The object may have passed quite close to Fairchild AFB, which is located just west of Spokane.  PD))<n>

A very perplexing issue is that during the witnessed light on the monitor a trip outside proved no visible light at all  The cameras are infrared suggesting an infrared projection.

I was using the telephone pole and powers lines as a eye guide .<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it flew wwn it gradually went up and down , not up and down fast , like it was in a turbulence or somewhat . Then it starting to fade to nothing or maybe the direction that it was going could have been heading north .<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no flashing red light , no sound and after it disappear a smaller plane was coming up with a flashing red light like it going to the area where it disappeared .<n> <n><n> <n><n> North of me there is airport and to the east three airports , all within 10 to 30 mins driving .  While this star was moving there were planes flyng northeast , east and south with flashing red lights .<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since I was walking my dog I couldn&#39;t get my smartphone out in time to take a video or pictures .<n> <n><n> <n><n> The star moved and disappeared around 3 mins .<n> <n><n> <n><n> To the best of my knowledge this looked like a star . Some nights you can see falling stars but they moved differently , but no this was a star like object in our air space .<n>
2/4/14 18:05|West Friendship area|MD|Sphere|3-4 minutes|4 dimly white sphere shaped objects; independent rapid movement; at times would form into one object|2/7/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106932.html|483|ndxe201402| 4 dimly white sphere shaped objects; independent rapid movement; at times would form into one object<n> <n><n> <n><n> At approximately 18:05 while traveling north/north east on MD RT 32 between Tridelphia Rd and MD Rt 44 notice 4 dimly white sphere shaped objects.  The formation of the objects was pretty tight, moved quickly in different directions, and at times seemed to form back into one object, then break off again.  There was low cloud cover and the outside temprature (according to my car) was 27F.  If I was to guess, I&#39;d say the circumferance of each object was between 10-20 feet but hard to judge not knowing the cloud ceiling.  At first I thought these were some type of high powered lights but this is a relatively rural area moderately populated with no large commercial businesses/structures that might account for the lights.  I pulled to the side of the road and attempted to photograph and video the episode though my car window with very bad results.  The spheres headed east and I lost them through the trees.  There were other cars on the road as RT 32 is a main artery to northern Howard and Carroll Counties for commuters and would be very interested if anyone else witnessed a similar event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was looking out of the port-side windows, observing the blanket of cloud cover.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then saw a black object moving in roughly the opposite direction of the aircraft I was in.  The object was flying a bit higher, but within a few hundred feet of the altitude of my aircraft.  We had reached cruising altitude, which for a domestic flight may have been approximately 20,000 feet.  I estimate the object&#39;s distance as approximately 1,000-2,000 yards away from the aircraft I was in.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object&#39;s shape was rounded.  Not a sphere, but with width and height that were approximately the same length.  The object had rounded details that protuded both from the sides and from top to bottom.  The object was very dark black in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first glance I thought the object was another plane moving the opposite direction.  As I continued observing the object I saw that it was moving at a pace that was unusual.  It was at that time I also mentally noted the object&#39;s black shape and unconventional shape.  It was moving in a very straight line at a fast pace, one that did not seem at all consistent with an commercial or known military aircraft.  The pace of the object surprised me and made me observe it more closely.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At this time, after observing the object for less than 10 seconds, I looked down at my phone briefly, for only a second or two.  I then looked immediately back to where the object had been and it was nowhere to be seen.  When I had looked down, the object was not about to pass behind my place and out of sight.  I was startled to see that the object was no longer in the sky, and leaned forward to look out of the window farther towards the front of the airplane, where I could look farther behind us.  The object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

At first we figured it was a plane, but we realised it was stationary.  Once we got closer, right by the hills halfway between downtown and the intersection with highway 85, we observed the craft from about 500 ft, and saw it was triangular in shape, probably about the size of a car itself.  We saw a second one later on down the road, and maybe a third one but it was too far to tell.  They were both with the same characteristics though, stationary and the same lights.<n>

Visible for almost 80 degrees of the sky, almost directly overhead and just west/above Orion.  It was followed by a second high speed light we assume was also a satellite in the exact same path about 15 seconds later.  Then, about 5 seconds later, there was a THIRD light traveling at the same high rate of speed, but following a west to east track that crossed the path of the first two.  The path actually crossed through Orion&#39;s belt before it faded out.  I&#39;ve seen a lot of satellites, but I&#39;ve never seen them so bright, so fast, or visible for so long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I looked up to the space station as i always do and just to the right of it but closer to me than the station about 1-2 miles no more i saw a triangle with three lights one to the front and two to the back? they were bright lights not the usual lights you see on planes, much brighter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My first thought was thats a big plane but comparing it to the two that was nearby, what i was watching was not a plane because the way that it was flying, it was moving faster than the two planes i was comparing it with, it was very big and with no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we all know we can here planes for miles and what happens when it goes past you here the raw ((sic.  Roar)) of the engines, this had no sound either coming towards me, or when it past.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One other thing i would like to mention is when i lived in the UK i had a bungalow and i took photo&#39;s of the star constellations but without the flash so that i could see the stars, and when i went in i looked at the photo&#39;s on my camera but could not see a lot so i put them onto the computer and magnified them about 100 and took it up to 400.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time i was beginning to see the stars and other shapes, i know it sounds funny but they were like different size buttons!! i first thought it must be me doing some thing wrong so the following night i used my tripod a full size one and to my astonishment they were there again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I tried a few nights later  and used the tripod and this time i could see the stars as before but their were several blurs ? and i came to the conclusion that if the stars were visible that tells me that the blurs were moving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that some of you nice people out there please try the camera at night with no flash and let me know what you find.

I had national guard drill on this weekend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We left WV around 6-615pm because the snow storm started and I had to work Monday night and didn&#39;t want to be stranded and miss work.  It takes about 2-3 hours to get to the East River Mountain Tunnel where this occured.  (Bluefield WV - Bland County Virginia I-77 southbound).  We exited the tunnel which enters Virginia - Bland County?  Not 100% on that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After exiting I looked to the right because cops/state police usually sit there and a car passed us going over the speed limited which is why I looked there.  The next thing I remember I was facing forward without remembering changing the way I was looking.  It almost looked like it was daylight outside, but the light seemed like a white light with a extremely light haze/fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During this time I remember thinking why is it light outside its 9-10pm at night in the winter, then a bright flash came over and the light was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My fiancee next said did the car just die or are the lights off?  We both looked and the car was still running and the lights were still on, the transition from the bright light to just the car lights may have caused us to think the car died or the lights were off.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had also slowed down from about 55 mph to about 35-40 mph, as well as the car in front of us and cars in the opposite lanes.  This is when we questioned what just happened it all seemed to happen in a short amount of time.  I remember looking back and the tunnel was not in sight...which means we traveled a good distance in this white light before the flash and us slowing down and it seemed like several minutes passed by during this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Has anyone else experienced something like this?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would also like to add I saw a strange formation of lights with no particular pattern that we both saw in Charleston, WV, about 2 hours before exiting the tunnel.  The colors of light in the staggered! formation were a bright white to a burnt orange<n>

I spotted 2 football-sized objects that appeared to be on fire in the sky above departure bay that were slowly moving towards earth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was shocked as well as the other passengers so we pulled over on the side of the road.  We watched as the football sized objects got bigger and bigger until they both were the size of a small car (smart car) with flaming trails behind them headed for earth at about a 45-degree angle.  In awe, we watched and just before the 2 objects came down past the tree line they stopped and became smaller.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we started to drive towards these 2 now smaller red lights, they moved away from us, still only a couple hundred yards in the sky.  After driving down departure bay for a minute or so the first light started to dim and shot up in the sky.  We pulled into a church parking lot and the second orb raised higher and higher above the church.  As it moved higher in the sky is started to pulsate red and disappeared.<n>

It was beside the lake in Lake Country, and I looked up for  a moment at the night sky and observed a very bright light about 100 feet or less above the lake near the edge of the road.  It appeared to be hovering and at first I thought it was a helicopter, but as I looked again, I noted that it was now moving and getting lower and sped up slightly.  It also had a triangle shape wing at each side, the one of the left was red and lit up, and on the right was blue.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It dropped down quite low and then fell behind my field of vision.  It was quite astonishing to see it that close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))<n>

Its brightness gave the distinct outline a glow that made the object appear nearly twice the size of the distinct outline.  I spotted it over central/western???  Florida from 8:10pm to about 8:13pm 02.02.2014 from Treasure Coast, Florida.  Object was originally moving NNNW from the vicinity of the southwest everglades, possibly the west coast of Florida??? and almost imperceptibly faded off to NNW... somewhere around 10-15 degrees when passing Tampa direction/area??? dead west of the Treasure Coast. The object was much larger than any known aircraft and was moving much faster than ! any normal jet... and not very high in the atmosphere like you would expect from experimental trials. At first I was able to clearly make out the outline within the glow but then the outline was obscured into an orange-red blob as the distance increased. Object disappeared as if headed to western FL panhandle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Afterwards, the sighting was followed by what appeared to be individual rockets launched about two minutes apart seemingly originating from SW FLorida coast at approximately 8:30, 8:32 and 8:34pm and more launchings at 10pm. Cannot confirm these times like I can the original sighting until I check my camera. Repeated launchings were sighted past 10pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The later sightings of the much smaller, much slower &#34;rockets&#34;??? were traveling in a more westerly direction towards the Gulf. The first few rockets started out in a more northerly direction and later rockets veered further west. I only say rockets because two of them appeared to have &#34;staged&#34; a booster separation soon after sighting. Booster separations??? were consistently timed/located/dropped SWW off west coast of FL and rockets??? disappeared on various trajectories from NW to NWW towards Gulf).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Of the multiple &#34;rockets&#34;??? seen... two clearly staged separations that were distinct... looking much like a short lived blue-white light being dropped like a bomb.  Both &#34;separations&#34;??? &#34;drops&#34;??? occurred in virtually the same location.  The &#34;rockets&#34; appeared to be reddish, and about 1/40th the size of the object &#34;disc&#34;??? (flattened, pointed football shape).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took pictures of both the disk??? and the rockets??? but I was late on the draw and the distinct outline had already blended with the glow prior to my first shot.  I was not able to time the photos with the actual staging??? of the rockets.  Videos of the rockets taken are useless.  No video of the original object sighting was taken during its brief sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I made the original sighting and managed to share the sighting with my dad after getting his attention.  The rocket??? launchings which followed were seen by the whole family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No noise was heard from any sighting.  Can provide images but I doubt they will be of any use. Enlargements don&#39;t show details or clear outline.<n>

I saw a red looking cross / X in the sky coming over the tree line @ 65 to 70 degrees from me.  It was either gaining in altitude or entering clouds.  The direction it was heading was due west.  A second red cross/X appeared seconds later a few degrees south of the first one. This one passed the first one on the north side.  Both of these red crosses/X’s appeared to be climbing in altitude or entering the upper clouds.  Through the tree line I could see two more red crosses/X’s appearing.  All four were heading due west.  I ran inside our house grabbed my Swarovski’s and asked my wife to come and look at these red crosses/X’s; which she did.  It took me maybe 30 seconds to run inside and back out, by then only one red cross/X was visible with our eyes.  As I was looking through the binoculars at the fourth red cross/X it did not look red or like a cross/X, it had a yellowish looking l! ight/beam in the center and a hazy/aura on the outside of the light.  As this passed over head of me I continued following it using the binoculars.  The light was disappearing and then I could see it actually take shape which looked like a dark dome shaped canopy as I continued looking at it.  It was heading west, and looked like a large black umbrella moving across the sky.  These objects did not make any aircraft noise or any noise at all.  About 20 minutes after the four objects disappeared I heard aircraft flying overhead heading west.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This whole process was 5 minutes in duration.  These four red lights were not blinking and were ten times larger than any aircraft lighting.  Viewed through binoculars the yellowish looking light was 5 times larger than any helicopter’s spot light.  Due to not knowing what altitude these units were at I am not sure how large they were.<n>

Commercial aircraft were landing to the North at SEATAC; two aircraft were observed moving down the approach to SEATAC from the southwest to the west-northwest horizon from our vantage point while the amber/orange light was in the northwest sky.  Local fireworks in celebration of the Seahawks Superbowl win were seen through the trees all around the western horizon as seen from our house.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light appeared to move very slowly southward or south-southeastward from the first position we saw it in the northwest, 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon.  The light appeared to change its direction and speed of movement from southward or southeastward, to southwestward, and rapidly increase its altitude.  After about 13 minutes from when we first spotted the light above the NW horizon we lost sight of it to the west of our position and roughly 70 degrees elevation.<n>

Portland.  It started out bright red, and made no sound.  It began to dim until it disappeared completely.  I didn&#39;t believe that it was a planet or a star because it was underneath a cloud cover, it did not appear to be a plan because it was moving slower than a plane and at times remained still.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Moments later it reappeared bright red again then dimmed and disappeared this was over a period of 15 minutes and after appearing a second time it did not reappear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had posted a message on facebook asking if anyone else had saw the bright red light, about an hour later at 20:08 hours a friend who lives 20 miles SW from me responded to my post stating that they could see it and as! ked me what it was.  During its second appearance I had taken pictures and a short video of the red orb which my husband had sent prior to this entry.<n>

It was kind of low on the horizon and would blink, the way a planet or star blinks.  I can saw with pretty much certainty it wasn&#39;t an object in (Outer) space, due to the fact it was pretty cloudy and overcast.  You could not see any stars or the moon.  So taken from that, it had to have been in the atmosphere.  Anyways, It was blinking brightly, then would slowly dim, while still blinking, till it &#34;blinked&#34; out, so to speak. This would happen over the course of 1 - 3 minutes.  Once it &#34;blinked&#34; out, it would be gone for like 4 - 5 minute, then reappear, all of a sudden, in what seemed to be the exact same place.  This went on for at least 15 minutes, that we (the ones who witnessed it) were outside.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;To be left off the record&#34; My wife and I, who witnessed the event, are believers in ufo/aliens/other life existence besides earth.  I personally have never seen anything, nor would I wish to draw attention to myself or my wife.  With that being said,  My wife did take a video of it along with some pictures, I can get from her and send via e-mail.  I have selected the option to have a return call, but if done so, please do it between the hours of 13:00 - 22:00 PST.  Thank you<n>

For an example, I was planing to leave my house to meet some friends and the next thing I know I had lost 1 hour.  A lot of times I cant recognize my memory loss until it is pointed out to me.  I thought maybe it was normal up until a several weeks ago.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the night of the incident I woke up at around 2am.  I was working that day and had planned on waking up at 3:40 am.  I woke up to the sound of my dog barking who was in a cage next to my bed.  Let it be noted that when I woke up I was wide awake, absolutely no groggy or sleepiness but a completely aware state.  This is very uncommon for me.  I was also feeling kind of hot and damp from sweat.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked my dog downstairs and out of my apartment to a grassy patch.  I looked up towards the side of my apartment I saw a very tall pale figure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This figure appeared to be male and nude.  He was tall pale with thick red hair.  He walked away from me and stepped over my apartment&#39;s 5 to 6 foot high fence in one slow careful stride.  He quickly disappeared from sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point I should note that I was not scared or startled but fixated on the figure.  It wasnt until the following day that I could comprehend what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that I live near and work at a military base.  After some research I learned that it is common people to be visited that are near military bases.<n>

These lights were massive.  They appeared to be at a high altitude of 40,000+ feet but still extremely large in size (much larger than any C-17 or C-5 Galaxy could produce).  They slowly seemed to be moving in the direction of where I was standing.  And just like that, one of the lights dimmed out- then the rest just dimmed out with in a second.  I had to be standing there for 10 minutes watching this. I should have grabbed my phone to record but was just in complete awe.<n>

Way too fast to be a plane and had absolutely no sound.  Complete silence.  It was flying as low or lower than a plane coming into the air port for landing, but going in the opposite direction, toward  the West.  It did go in a straight line, not changing directions.  There was no smoke or light trail from it, it was an extremely bright light like a huge led light, but solid.  It was so bright like it was giving off its own light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft seamed to be picking up speed as it was going.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The  time was approximately 10:48 pm.  I stayed outside for about 4 more minutes looking up and waiting to hear or see something else like an airplane or sound from the craft that  was catching up to it,  but it was still and quiet.  The sky was very clear.  I contemplated what I had just seen.  I am very, very sure of what I saw.  I am still shaking a little.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not know if this has any relevance but as I was on the phone with my husband I tried to put the phone on speaker phone just seconds before I saw the object and the screen would turn black every time I brought my hand close to it.  This happened three times (with in just a few seconds) then the phone gave me a notice that the internet connection was unstable.  As I put the phone back to my head and told my husband that the internet was being weird  I saw the object coming over the house heading West.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did have my glasses on but as it passed I stood up and took a step off the patio to watch it as it disappeared flying into the west, so it was not a reflection in my glasses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I do not want people to think I am weird.  But I felt I needed to tell someone even if it is just logged somewhere that some one saw something in Boise on February 1 at very close to 10:48pm-ish in case some one else saw the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you.<n>

They were orange-ish.  They had no blinking lights like planes, they were moving very slowly rising up from above the visible horizon, which was partly blocked by houses and trees so I only saw them when they rose above those.  They seemed to prefer flying in triangular formations, or something approximating a triangle.  They would fly a certain distance across the sky and then gradually fade out.  I am unaware of any normal explanation for these things: apart from their bizarre appearance, there were too many of them too quickly to be civilian, and there was no official military activity to explain them either.  They moved slowly but at times seemed to zig zag in a narrow area in a way that seemed unlike airplanes, but I can&#39;t prove that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I caught video of it on my smartphone, and when that failed to take video due to low battery (my Moto G refused to shoot video when the battery got too low), I switched to my tablet (Nexus 7 2013 edition rear-facing camera).  At some point one of my neighbors came out and was seeing it, but her English was imperfect so we had a hard time understanding each other.  I was on the phone with my fiancee at the time, so you can often hear my side of the conversation but not hers.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hesitated to even report this, but this was way too big.  The &#34;armada&#34; as I thought of them went on and on and on and I would really like to know, if possible, what it was I actually saw.<n>

There were two at first but I lost track of the second one.  They weren&#39;t falling like flares though, they were moving across the sky slowly, hovering in place and then slowly moving on before stopping again.  I watched it move very slowly across the sky from the south to the north east.  There was no perceivable engine noise like a jet or helicopter, it wasn&#39;t far from the ground... helicopters fly over the valley all the time but you can hear those for miles.  It was moving too slow to be a jet. I like to think I&#39;m good at identifying aircraft, its been a hobby of mine since I was a kid and have been to over 50 airshows over the years.  After about two minutes observing from outside my car, the light went out and I lost it for a second, but found it again silhouetted against the clouds from the city lights...it was a dark, non-reflective oval shape that continued along NE towards the Wasatch mountains<n>

The object was triangular in shape.  My guess of its altitude is about 3000 feet.  When I lowered my window, I was unable to detect if it made any sound as the highway traffic was heavy.  Had it been an airplane, though, it was low enough that I would have heard its engines.  The light on the object was green, but it was solidly on--as opposed to an airplane light which blinks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Pulling my vehicle to the side of the road for a better view, in the moment it took me to open my door, the craft has disappeared.  I continued to look for it for several seconds, but did not see it again.<n>

To the left of our TV is a window that has a mostly unobstructed view of the sky.  There are no buildings behind our apartment, and the trees are bare, which allowed me to see the sky clearly.  Suddenly a circular red and green light caught my eye.  I believe I either saw a UFO or (more likely) a drone.  It was hovering in the sky.  I got up and went to the window.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend, who was sitting on the couch facing away from the window, but she didn&#39;t look fast enough.  Once I got up, I saw the object for only a few moments, and then it flew out of my view.  Again, it was circular, red and green (half red, half green, shaped a lot like that old Simon game), and it moved fluidly.  We live not far from airports, but it was nothing like the usual air traffic (planes or helicopters) we see on a regular basis.<n>

It looked like the two objects were playing tag with each other.  They didn&#39;t have a definite shape since they were in the clouds.  But they looked like they could be circular in shape if they were out of the clouds.  They were only visible to the naked eye and no camera could seem to pick up the objects.<n>
2/1/14 19:15|Mesquite|NV|Sphere|3 minutes|Large white sphere on the Mesa in Mesquite, Nevada.|2/21/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/107/S107172.html|541|ndxe201402| Large white sphere on the Mesa in Mesquite Nevada<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred on February 1, 2014, around 7:15 pm from my house in the small city of Mesquite, Nevada.  My house is on a ridge that looks down into the neighborhoods below and I have a direct view of the Mesa on the west of the city.  I don’t know how far away the top of the Mesa is from my house but I cannot tell if people are standing on the Mesa, they would be too small.  I can see very small Joshua trees that grow on the edge of the Mesa buy they are extremely small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On this night I walked into my bedroom, the lights were not on.  I looked toward the large windows on the west end of my bedroom and noticed a narrow ring of lights surrounding a very large gray circle.  It was as if something was blocking the lighted object behind the gray circle.  It seemed like the object was hanging in the sky just in front of the top of the Mesa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I walked toward the window I thought it was the moon, but realized it was much too big to be the moon and in a position in the sky the moon is never in.  Then the object began to light up.  It was a very large white sphere, bigger than a hot air balloon and perfectly round.  It was now hovering above the Mesa.  On each side of the sphere there seemed to be spotlights shining up on the sphere.  The sphere was made of a material that reflected light and made the sphere look shiny and smooth.  There was also light illuminating from the bottom of the sphere down onto the mesa this lighting was not as bright as ! the spotlight type lights.  There seemed to be black appendages attached to the bottom of the sphere.  The bottom of the sphere was very brightly lit but I could clearly see the top of the sphere though it was not as lit up.  I began to question what I was seeing in my mind.  I thought maybe it was four wheelers but realized their lights would not be bright enough to light up this object or for me to see from my house.  The top of the Mesa is only accessible by all terrain vehicles such as four wheelers and motorcycles.  There is not a power source in this area of the Mesa to provide power to a spotlight.  I could not figure out what I was seeing and as I kept watching it, the lights went out.  Now I could only see the gray white sphere but it seemed to be getting smaller.  It was not lit up at all only by the moon.  As I watched it, I realized it was getting smaller and very fast.  I ran into the living room and told my husband to get up and see this object.  He did not kn! ow where I was looking or what I was looking at and couldn’t s! ee it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Besides, by that time, the only thing left was the dome of the top of the sphere and it appeared to quickly sink into the ground with the rest of the sphere.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As this event was taking place,  I looked down into the neighborhood below to see if cars were stopping to see this strange phenomenon but I didn’t see any cars traveling the roads or stopping to view this sight.  I then thought perhaps the casino, Casa Blanca, had an event but there had never been any advertising about this and there was no one around to watch it.  I checked the newspapers for the next few days to see if anything had been reported or if indeed the Casa had sponsored an event.  There was never a word mentioned about what I had seen.  I also asked many people around town and none of them had seen anything.  I asked my friend whose husband works for the power company if Nellis Air Force Base had asked them to shut down any power grids for maneuvers they may be performing, but nothing like that had occurred.  I also had her ask her teenage son if he knew if any of the kids had been up on the Mesa and were responsible for what I had seen.  They claimed no respon! sibility.  Another friend asked her Sunday school class if they knew anything about it but they said it was probably the super moon.  I checked that out too and the moon was a crescent during this time not a sphere.  I even looked in Las Vegas online papers to see if it had been reported there but no luck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a retired teacher with a masters degree and national board certification in education.  I taught school for 15 years and trained and taught student teachers at the university level.  I do not drink or take drugs of any kind.  I am so puzzled by this.  It has been on my mind continually since it happened so I am reporting it hoping I can forget it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know this sounds very bizarre.  I did not get a picture but I did draw what I had seen so i wouldn&#39;t forget details. i just want to know I am not going crazy!<n>

It was just like looking at a star traveling across the entire sky but not like a shooting star that goes fast.  It was extremely slow and steady at the same pace the entire time.<n>
2/1/14 19:00|Kent|WA|Sphere|1:30|Three circular red objects in triangular formation|2/7/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/106/S106856.html|543|ndxe201402| Three circular red objects in triangular formation<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Saturday, February 1st , I went outside on my deck to get my cat inside.  It was approximately 7:00PM.  There is a wooded area behind our house. I saw three circular red lights in the distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They weren’t moving like planes, so I assumed that they were perhaps military helicopters.  I estimate that their altitude was perhaps 2,000 feet.  The other reason that I thought they were helicopters was that they seemed fairly close together, as opposed to how planes would be.  There was cloud cover and the lights were below the clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I didn’t think much of the lights until I noticed that they weren’t moving.  They were in a triangular formation with one light at the top, another light below it and to the left and a third light to the right of the second light and a bit below it.  I still thought that they must be helicopters at this point and I kept watching because it was unusual to see three of them flying together.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point, the uppermost light moved in an unusual way.  From my viewpoint, it moved down and then to the left, toward the second light.  It remained there for just a couple of seconds and then went to the right and up to it’s original position as the top light in the triangle.  This movement was very fast and struck me as being unusual for a helicopter.  Both times that it moved, both going down and back up again, it followed what could be described as a reverse ‘L’ shape.  For example, it moved down and then moved to the left at a 90 degree angle.  After that, it followed the same path in reverse, moving quickly to the right and then moving up at 90 degrees to get to it’s original position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After seeing that movement, it finally occurred to me that they might not be helicopters. Other than The top light, the other two had not moved for over a minute.  I thought that it would be unusual for Three helicopters to maintain position for that long.  Also, there were no blinking navigation lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Just solid red lights. I listened carefully for any noise of helicopters, but there was none.   Three helicopters that close and at that low altitude would have made noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I grabbed my iPhone that was nearby and started taking what I intended to be a video, but as it turned out, there are just still photos.  I have three photos of the lights and also the trees in the foreground.  I went inside to get my girlfriend and have her look.  I was inside for perhaps 10 seconds.  When we both got out to the deck, only one of the lights remained. After a few seconds, it was no longer visible.  My thought was that it went above the cloud cover and could no longer be seen.  The other two lights may have done the same thing while I was inside.  The photos show three very defined circular red lights.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The defined circular shape was another thing that made me think they might not be helicopters because navigation lights would be blinking and have more of a starburst type effect as opposed to being circular.<n>

It was crisp, clear, still night, and I often look up to see the moon and array of stars on such nights.   When I looked up, I saw what I first assumed were the red lights of 2 planes in the sky.  We live near where planes fly over going towards PDX, so this wouldn‘t be unusual.  What sparked my interest was their distance from each other.  They were very close for planes, so I continued watching them while walking the dog, looking up and down between the sidewalk (it was very dark in the area I was in), the dog, and the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In the brief moments of switching my gaze, another red “ball” appeared, as if a light was switched on, and again, very close to the two others already there, not moving.  Now, realizing these were not planes, I looked down, and gave the command to the dog to wait so we could stop and watch, and when I looked back up, another had arrived.  They were all lined in a horizontal row at this point.  A fifth red “ball” zoomed out of the East, joining the others, holding the horizontal pattern. 3 more, speeding to the others, for a total of 8 lined up.  Once the eighth one got there, they configured themselves, into what I have drawn below.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They did not casually “float” into position, nor did they waver, they silently zoomed and stopped.  They held that configuration for about 20 seconds, then one by one, they disappeared; it looked liked they just blinked out.  As the configuration was disappearing, a ninth red ”ball” came from the East, lined up, held, as if waiting for the tenth, which then came zooming in as the last one held.  The 2 remained adjacent for a short time, and then just disappeared.   All of this happened very quickly, less than a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I thought a lot of people must have been watching this, so I’d just watch the news when I got home and probably find out what it was.  However, I have been searching the Net for 2 days now and have seen nothing.  This was so amazing; I cannot believe I am the only person to have seen it.  I am not really a UFO believer, and I knew nothing about your website.  The only thing I could find on the Net that resembled what I saw was the “red fireballs” Peter Davenport has described, which led me to your site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Configuration:  O   O   O O       O OO       O O O<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Formation drawn above did not survive the transfer into the database.

My husband called me outside, where he had been grilling, to see an orange fire-ball looking light flying low in the sky heading southwest.  It slowly flew in a descending line, then paused and flew upward for a bit before continuing south and then disappeared behind the houses.  Ran to the front yard, but it was nowhere to be seen.  I didn’t hear any sound from it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Five minutes later, my husband called me and the kids back outside to the backyard.  Another orange light was flying in the same direction, but at a slightly lower altitude. This one seemed smaller and made more turns than the first.  It also flew behind the houses, but when we ran to the front, it was visible flying south for a few seconds before turning and heading in a westerly direction and then it just disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were not sure if it was the same craft that circled around without us seeing it (my husband was watching the sky the whole time after losing sight of the first one) or if it was a second craft.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We’ve never seen anything like it.<n>

It did change shape somewhat, not much.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I went into my garage and retrieved my 50X binoculars to get a better look.  What I saw was a black object that seemed to be a jumble of mix of cubes and other shapes mostly black but not completely.  It looked as if it was mottled with black and no color.  The object was tumbling with the sun reflecting and this was why it appeared to be changing shape.  I came to the conclusion that it must be a bunch of balloons as the tumbling seemed to be effortless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I was breathing heavy from yard work it was hard to get a very stable look with the binocular.  I looked around to find something stable my shaking.  Not finding anything I looked up without the binoculars and could not find it.  I asked my wife where it was as she was watching it only with her eyes.  She said it just disappeared, was there and then gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was traveling west to east at about 25 mph and was about 500 feet above us.  The weather was clear and no wind at all.  The object appeared to have a flat path not going up or down.  It’s hard to say what size it was but I would guess it was 20 feet across.  It was not a uniform shape.  Also no sound.<n>

She stated that on February 1, of 2014, there was a faintly visible fleet of 3 silvery objects traveling in triangular-shaped formation heading north at high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She stated that there was clearly 3 separate object rather than 1 since they all had a random drift pattern in flight.  No lights or sound were noticed while she watched, these objects move in a direct path in the daylight sky.  She was only able to see these after noticing a plane flying close to the area of the sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After viewing the trio of UFOs she said there appeared to be a military-type plane that followed (after the objects left) the same direction the craft went, only moving slower.  Perhaps classified Air Force surveillance?<n>

EXTREMELY loud sound..of craft that have passed my skies in previous years, as reported by me herein.  This engine &#39;roar&#39; is unlike conventional jets, military or otherwise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sound was so loud as they approached from the SE (which would be from the Atlantic ocean side) that it seemed they would come right over my house by a few hundred feet...not thousands of feet, as they did.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked up to see three, black, triangular craft racing toward the NW at about 15,000 feet.  The three craft were about the size of my pinkie finger nail at arm&#39;s reach.  The amazing thing about these 3 craft, other than their deep, bass, loudness, was the fact that they were perfectly spaced from each other across..not forward to back.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The 3 were identical in shape and color..no after-burner or smoke of any kind...but perfectly spaced, both horizontally and vertically from each other, by, perhaps a mile or so.  Only the Navy&#39;s Blue Angels could come close to this juxtaposition, I believe.  The sound was the same as in past years as was the direction of travel..SE to NW.  Their first appearance, as I&#39;ve reported previously, was very dramatic at rooftop level flight, and doing acrobatic maneuvers not consistent with conventional jets..their lighting was totally different as well.  Since that first encounter, about this time of year 3 or maybe 4 years ago, their appearances have been at much higher altitudes and their plane of travel has been perfectly straight and level.  I saw no lights from these craft today, but have in the past, at night, as one simple large blinking red light underneath each one.  My first sighting of these craft, as mentioned, involved multi lights on each craft, going from all white to all red and back to all white..very strange.  I don&#39;t know what these craft are but they are NOT conventional jet military aircraft.  This is continuing and very odd.  This is the fourth encounter of these craft here over the past four years.<n>
