I just wish I could remember more about what happened.I would like to get together with the others and see what they remember about that nite.We no longer live in Brady but still have friend and relatives there.Thank you for your site,people laugh when I tell them we saw a ufo when we were younge but I can tell you I&#39;m a believer for sure.Also I&#39;m guessing about the date,I know school was just out for summer or about to start because it was initation night in Brady ,when the older high school kids initate the freshmen in to school.I have written a pretty long letter trying to explain so delete whatever you need to.Also I would like to say that it happened about 9:30 at nite but I didn&#39;t know how to put the time in for that.You can contact me via e-mail if you need to or call but it has been a long time now.I don&#39;t know how you would be able to get any information except from the four of us now.Thank you for your patience in reading this long letter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the date of the sighting is approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The place was Toms River, New Jersey.  We lived on Fawn Drive. The object appeared around midnight. The light woke me up from my sleep. The object looked like the full moon and it hovered over the house of the neighbor across the street. The actual moon was to the south of the object. I was looking east toward the Atlantic Ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After observing the object for what seemed like 10 minutes I returned to bed, very fearful. After a short while I felt paralyzed and could not even yell for my parents. Shortly after that I saw what looked like a humanoid figure dressed in some sort of space suit wearing a helmet. I felt lulled into a sleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next thing that woke me up was the sound of what was at least two fighter jets. We lived close to Lakehurst NAS; McGuire AFB was a little farther away; but then again nothing is far away in New Jersey. After the jets passed over my sense of fear went away and I fell back asleep.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Interestingly enough, a neighbor two housed down the street, who had mocked us for my sighting was, in his words, &#34;buzzed by some UFO&#39;s on my way to work the other morning.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

8/22/70 21:30|Sebastian|FL|Unknown|5 minutes|Blue cone shaped light appears from sky and flashes downward as it pursues a family in vehicle.|9/2/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45443.html|4|ndxe197008| Blue cone shaped light appears from sky and flashes downward as it pursues a family in vehicle.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Father, mother, mother&#39;s 16 year old sister, 11 year old son with 12 year old friend, and 5 year old daughter were southbound near the coast on a deserted (at that time) stretch of Highway A1A in a Country Squire station wagon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Two boys sitting in a fold-up seat and facing out the back window were the first to observe a blue cone shaped light beam that appeared to originate maybe one or two hundred feet above the ground and then flash downwards to the ground as it spread out.  The beam would flash and then dissapear only to flash again from another point. The beam was roughly following the path of the two lane roadway and was catching up to the vehicle which was traveling at about 60 miles per hour.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The boys alerted the other vehicle occupants who then turned or used the rearview mirrors to see the the blue light.  The father began to slow the vehicle saying he wanted to stop to get a better look.  This panicked the mother who was afraid of the light, so the father accelerated and the light was soon not seen anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was the 11 year old son.  I don&#39;t really believe in extraterrestrial visitors but after 8 years in the US Air Force and 20 years as a police officer, I am still unable to explain what I saw that night.  The hardest and most disturbing part to explain is how slowly the beam moved as it progressed down towards the ground.  To the best of my knowledge, even today, light can only be made to move like that in certain tightly controlled laboratory environments and then only on a very small scale.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

8/20/70 01:00|Spring City|TN|Fireball|Approx 1 minute|Large fireball hovers above ground and then streaks into space at high speed.|2/14/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/073/S73868.html|5|ndxe197008| Large fireball hovers above ground and then streaks into space at high speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Myself and two friends were coming home from the county fair and riding in a truck together in the front cab. The oldest friend was driving the truck; next oldest friend was riding in the passenger seat, and me (youngest) was sitting in the middle.  Arrived in front of my house in a small community called Wolf Creek, and my friend opened the passenger door and got out of the truck so I could get out. I lived out in the country and there was a small farm across the road from my house with a pasture and a hillside. Upon exiting the truck, I noticed a large object hovering about 8 feet above the ground that had a fireball appearance. This was only about 75 yards from us. Both my friends saw the same thing. There was a very low hissing type of sound coming from the object. At first, we thought is was a tall bush burning, but there were no bushes there to burn, and obviously none that would be 8 feet tall. After watching the fireball object for about a minute, the! large object started slowly rising up toward the sky and then shot up in the sky at a very high rate of speed. The night was very clear and one could see every star in the sky on that night. Not a cloud anywhere. After the large fireball reached, what appeared to be the edge of earth&#39;s atmosphere, it split into two with a slightly smaller fireball now trailing right behind it. Almost immediately after that, the trailing fireball split into two and there were 3 fireballs streaking toward space.  Each fireball disappeared from sight as it reached far enough out in space to be out of sight.  I have told very few people about this incident and am not sure if my friends have told anybody as I have not seen them in a very long time.  I no longer live in Spring City and now live in Ashland City, TN which is just north of Nashville, TN.  We all had no doubt that this was some sort of craft from somewhere other than this planet.  Since then, I have thought about this incident many times in an attempt to define what this craft may have been.  Not sure if it was some sort of major alien craft, but feel now that it could very likely have been some sort of probe sent here from another craft in space.  But that&#39;s just speculation.  I do, however, know that this was not something man made, and that there was no one at the observation site other than the 3 of us.  I have no further information to disclose regarding this sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were standing on the balcony of the 6th floor of the block of flats where I lived.We suddenly noticed that in the clear sky there was a circular disc it did not seem to be very far away as it looked very large, and quite chunky.We could see the detail of it quite clearly. It looked metallic. It was hovering in the sky. We speculated on what it was, I thought it must be some kind of weather satellite as I just could not conceive what it could be, it was so clear but none of us had seen anything like it before. We were astounded however when it suddenly took off at an amazing speed and we followed its flight until it went out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was excited to read in our weekly local paper that this object had been spotted by many people in our local area. The local UFO society were appealing for witnesses to report it&#39;s description. However, I did not contact them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
8/15/70 21:30|Grand Bay (Canada)|NB|Unknown|ten minutes|strange maneuvers, various colored lights, over a drive-in theater, and chased within two minutes by three jets|3/23/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80526.html|7|ndxe197008| strange maneuvers, various colored lights, over a drive-in theater, and chased within two minutes by three jets<n> <n><n> <n><n> In August of 1970, I was working at the Grand Bay Drive-In.  Most of my earnings went towards my tuition for UNBSJ, the University of New Brunswick in Saint John, where I was enrolled in the Business Administration program.  I worked at the box office with cashier, ((name deleted by source)), an older lady who had been involved in Girl Guides for many years.  She always brought a cucumber sandwich for her mid-evening snack later on, when things got slow.  But this was my night off, and I was headed down to visit the gang at the cafeteria.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a warm night, and no sooner did I show up on the scene that someone suggested I go and fetch some Dairy Queen treats with ((name #2 deleted by source)), one of the confectionery cashiers. We took everyone’s order, and walked out back to her white 1968 Plymouth station wagon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As she drove toward the upper exit, I noticed a bright light in the sky.  It was headed in a southerly direction, but I couldn’t tell how high it was.  I didn’t think it had enough altitude to be a satellite.  Perhaps it’s a plane with the lights on, I wondered.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, it made a sharp turn to the east, and I asked ((name deleted)) if she had seen that. Of course, she hadn’t, she was driving.  I shrugged it off, and we made small talk the rest of our mission.  With cool treats, we returned to the Drive-In.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A good western was playing that night, &#34;The Magnificent Seven,&#34; starring Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen.  But as we drove across the field of speakers and patrons, we noticed that the interior lights of many cars were on.  People were standing outside, looking into the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ******* parked her car behind the cafeteria, where we found all the staff (including the manager, **** *****). They were also looking up. The only person not with the group was ****’s wife, *****, who had to stay inside with the money.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As soon as I got out of the car, a friend of mine who was parked in a nearby row came running up to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> &#34;You missed it!&#34; he blurted.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He explained that a strange light had appeared, right over the drive-in. It was making all kinds of weird maneuvers and changing colors, yellow-blue-green-red. I could feel his excitement, and wished I had seen it too. (And then I remembered the bright light I had seen in *******’s car as we were on our way to the DQ.)  &#34;Well, where is it now?&#34; I asked him.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He pointed to the east, across the Saint John River. I found it right away, and sure enough it was changing colors and jig-jagging from left to right until it finally petered out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He continued, &#34;It will be on the radio and in the newspaper for sure maybe on TV!  It was a flying saucer, sure as shootin!&#34;  Well, if it was a UFO, I missed it.  I stomped my foot in disgust.  The ruckus over, we headed inside to eat the Dilly bars and banana splits before they completely melted.  Intermission was about twenty minutes away, and hot dogs and popcorn had to be prepared for the rush between movies.  The second was &#34;The Time Travelers,&#34; a 1964 Sci-Fi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly, there was a loud roaring noise that shook the pots and pans hanging on the wall.  We ran outside just in time to see three jets, likely F-106’s, flying in formation.  It looked like they barely cleared the screen, they were so low.  And they were headed in the same exact direction as that mysterious light, to the east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, that was all I needed. I knew they were scrambled after a radar blip, maybe from Loring Air Force Base in eastern Maine?  And that radar blip was a genuine, honest-to-goodness, flying saucer! Wow! Talk about an exciting night!  The next day, I searched the paper for news of the sighting.  Nothing.  I listened to the radio, and watched the television.  Nothing.  Days turned into weeks, and weeks became months.  So what was all that about?  There is no way that three jets are going to zoom around so close to the ground in pitch-black night unless they were chasing something.  And it wasn’t just one or two people that saw it.  There had to be forty or fifty people at the drive-in that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

Large metallic disc, hovering noiselessly atabout 1/2 mile distance.  At least 200&#39; indiameter. No visible seams or antennas on aluminum colored craft. No windows. Many&#34;plasma-like&#34; bright white &#34;jets&#34; of light coming from small irregularly spaced &#34;ports&#34;around the circumference of the craft on its outer edges. Another small &#34;dome&#34; on top of craft...no &#34;dome on the bottom.  In other words...shaped like two &#34;saucers&#34; placed together (one up - one down), with another small &#34;saucer&#34; placed upside-down on the top&#34;saucer&#34;.  Hovered and made rapid right-angle turns.  We followed for 50 miles in car.  It speeded up, gained much altitude, left a contrail, turned an orange color, and wentover the western horizon. The craft alsoslowly rotated clockwise (viewing from below),while we viewed at close range. I reported to nearby Chanute AFB (now closed), but they laughed at our story. None of use are alcohol abusers or use drugs, and we have all been married many years to one-another now.<n>

Days surfing and nights at a camp ground 12 miles due West of Ocean City, N.J.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Slightly after midnight, with a very clear sky, we sat outside our tent looking at the stars.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A line of large, prop-driven, military cargo planes were passing directly overhead, going North.  A yard stick held at arms length would have been the length of their wings tip to tip. They flew so low their engine&#39;s noise prevented any conversation.   With the Vietnam war at its height, these flights were common along the coast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard the 1st plane coming minutes before it was directly overhead and the noise was intense until it moved on.  The 2nd plane, which appeared to be a mile behind the 1st was no different.  As it passed over,and onward, there was a flying disc shaped craft directly behind it by about 1/2 mile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The disc was as wide as the plane&#39;s wings, tip to tip. It didn&#39;t wobble, made no sound, and flew in the formation at what appeared to be the same speed as the cargo planes.  It had a few solid red lights on each edge as if marking the four points of a compass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As it glided off, following the 2nd plane, we saw that its middle was as thick as the cargo plane and tapered toward the edges.  No leading edge could be seen nor could we see any markings or windows.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In disbelief we were questioning each other as to what we were seeing when our speech was soon overwhelmed by the noise of the 3rd cargo plane now passing overhead.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Adding to our shock was the sight of another identical disc shaped craft tailing 1/2 mile behind it.  It was so silent we could here the crickets chirping as it went directly over our heads.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No more disc were seen as the remaining planes, perhaps six in all, continued out of site.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I haven&#39;t seen any U.F.O.&#39;s since nor has Tom.<n>

We had finished seeing the movie and I was about to drive away when I saw an enormous, bright white round light coming around the side of a nearby mountain (small mountain, but bigger than hill).  I pointed it out to the others and we discussed whether it was a logging truck (no roads there, besides it was to the side of the mountain) or the moon (moon was in a different position).  Scared the living daylights out of us and I sped the car over to the, by now, only remaining vehicle - a family in a station wagon with kids.  I yelled at them to look and they took off like bats out of hell.  I was quickly on their heels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What is intriguing about this is that we all lived in Fernie and gossip was a way of life in a small town.  We never discussed this after.  About 13 - 15 yrs. later, I remembered it and mentioned it to one of the women who was there and she seemed to think it was a logging truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know what I saw and there was no logging truck that could hang off the side of a mountain and certainly no truck could&#39;ve produced lights that size.  (There was only one light.  On the form above, I ticked off 1 craft buy we never actually saw a craft - only this enormous white ball.) Whatever it was, was moving very slowly around the mountain.  It was awesome and terrifying at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a lot of UFO sightings in Fernie, witnessed by many credible people, including RCMP officers.  When Cranbrook airport was called after these events, one would be told that nothing had appeared on the radar screens.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Since that event, I have experienced many paranormal experiences.  I don&#39;t know whether there is any connection or not, but thought I should mention it.  It&#39;s only now that I finally have a computer, that I&#39;m able to find someone to report this to.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eric Byler at Oregon UFO suggested I write and sends his regards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

I first noticed it at about 40-60 degrees above the northern horizon progressing towards the south, straight overhead. There was no audible sound. It appeared to be a cylinder, but only flames were visible against the black background of the night sky. Pieces seemed to be falling behind burning up as if they were peeling off the sides of the cylinder. It&#39;s speed could be compared to a jetliner crossing the sky at 30,000 ft, but it gave me the impression of being much higher, as the flames seemed to be peeling off in slow-motion (indicating a very large object at high altitude), so we had time to consider following it in the car, as it appeared to be headed for an impact in San Gabriel mountains just south of town. There was no impact flash as it disappeared behind the mountains. It travelled in a straight line the entire time.<n>

He began to watch the lights as he worked, as they appeared to move periodically then stop. He said he first became aware of feeling there was something feeling in the air which made him look around and see the lights.The light were togather but were not connected.They woud seem to be in formation,as in a triangle, then they would move into another pattern, or would just mold into another triangle with the lights in different places.It seems that there was a slight coloration in two of the lights, but it was subtle color.    Our farm sat on a pretty high hill and had good perspective of the surrounding area,and these lights did not seem to have much altitude.  After finishing the milking my parents brother and I got in our truck to go have a closer look at the lights. The lights were possibly 3/4 of a mile northwest of our farm so we went west to the first road north all the while the lights were clearly visible.  It was maybe 200 feet in the air, and moved from west to east as we approached.  This is a very primitive area of small farms, mostly having an incandescent light on a pole for a yard light if any outside light at all so there was no light contamination from man made sources.   We approached the lights  from the south, and were still to the east of it.  When we got as far north as the road would allow we turned west to get as close as possible.  It was then the lights seemed to get interested in us.  The lights moved east until they were parallel to us.  The movement was fairly quick and noticable, then as we drove slowly west on the road the lights moved parallel to our movement.  We would stop and watch the lights,and they would stop and hover.  The lights were perhaps 400 yards north of us and still roughly 200 feet in the air,but we heard no sounds coming from that direction.  As a matter of fact there was no sound of any kind to be heard. The very air around us seemed to deaden all sound even muffling the sound of our trucks engine. We drove to the next road then turned back south to the highway. The lights continued west for a short distance then turned south  with us only not quite coming to parallel with us this time.  We drove slowly watching the strange lights hoping it would not go away before we got to my grandparents house.  The lights did not come all the way to the highway but was still near enough to be seen clearly when we turned back east onto the highway.  When we turned east the lights turned east with us,but staying three or four hundred yards north of the highway.  The lights stayed with us until we reached my grandparents, but they were not home, so we drove another 1/4 mile up the highway to my aunt and uncles farm where we found my grandparents also.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father went into the house asking everyone to come out and look at the lights. There were 11 people all told with six adults four teenage children, and one younger (8) child.  We all watched the lights for another twenty minutes or more as they hovered in the sky periodically changing shapes,or patterns as though in a silent vacume,devoid of all night sound  you would have on a night in the country,no bug,no farm dogs barking,no cattle bawling....nothing. This was more troubling to all these farm people than the strange lights itself. Finally the lights just left. It didn&#39;t zoom away, or shoot up into space they just moved off along the horizon at the same low altitude almost &#34;casually&#34;. Then they were gone, and soon the noise of night resumed.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was almost completely dark.  I was with my motherand our neighbor next door.  I had just turned 15 on july 14th.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As my mother and our neighbor were talking I looked up to the northwest and saw lights coming towards us. It was completely round and the lights appear to be rotating around the rim.  The object resembled almost a child&#39;s top, the type you push the handle up and down and it makes the top spin.  It passed directly over our heads and was completely silent and there was no wind or any disturbance of the air.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I pointed up at the object and my neighbors and also my mother turned and looked at it and my neighbor turned and said that is a dirigible.  It went from northwest to south east over the top of our apartment complex on seventh avenue and dixie highway in pompano beach florida.  My neighbor insisted that it was a dirigible it was nothing unusual.  On myself only be 15 had never seen 1 before and I assumed he was correct.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After all this time of reading about ufo&#39;s I do not believe it was a dirigible but instead something else.  I have never seen it since and never saw anything like that prior to that night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date probably is approximate.  PD))<n>

From the way it was going on and off, we thought it was someone walking through the trees with a flashlight. Then the light became steady and started rising into the sky. It then began moving quickly to the North-East. Suddenly it stopped as if it had hit a wall. It remained motionless for about two seconds then the light changed to orange remaining motionless for about two more seconds then resumed the same course at a very high rate of speed. After a short time the light changed to red and the object appeared to double in speed. Within a few seconds it was out of sight. When it passed by we were approximately 1/4 mile away, yet we did not hear a sound.<n>
8/1/70 09:30|unknown|NH|Unknown|aprox.30 min|Nothing that my aunt or father or anyone I  asked had heard of any craft at that time that could go that fast.|11/20/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/020/S20516.html|18|ndxe197008| Nothing that my aunt or father or anyone I  asked had heard of any craft at that time that could go that fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> was in the back of a station wagon on the way home from visiting a relative in Lowell ME. I was looking at the stars as the view was very clear. Suddenly one of the stars moved. It was so fast that it went from the left to the right of one viewing hemisphire in less than one second. This UFO kept flying this way for approx.20-25 minutes,then stopped and remained in one place for about 2 min. Then a second UFO came straight down and locked with the first. Then a third came and they all stayed together for a few minutes and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
