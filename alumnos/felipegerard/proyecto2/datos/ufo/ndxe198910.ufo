10/31/89 18:30|El Jebel|CO|Unknown|5 seconds|Briefly observed black, silent, slow-moving object low enough to reflect ground lights from bottom, convex surface.|4/2/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05938.html|1|ndxe198910| Briefly observed black, silent, slow-moving object low enough to reflect ground lights from bottom, convex surface.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On 10/31/89, I observed an anomalous object in the fully dark night sky above El Jebel, Colorado (Eagle Cnty.). My family and I had just stepped out of our car after parking at the curb in a residential area that we intended to canvas for the purpose of trick-or-treating. It was fully dark, and a completely clear evening with no clouds. As my wife was getting our two boys&#39; costumes in order, I looked up into the night sky. Immediately, I observed what appeared to be a moving area of the night sky directly above me, through which the stars were totally obscured. I could not estimate the shape or size of whatever caused this phenomenon. There was no sound. There were no lights that seemed to be associated with the cause of the hidden stars. The only suggestion of the object&#39;s shape and altitude was that the bottom of the object appeared to be convex because I could see groundlight from the homes around us reflected from its surface. There were no lights in the neighborhood brighter than a streetlight or a porchlight. Therefore, I surmised that a dark object must be fairly low in altitude to reflect dim lights in such a manner. It moved steadily, and if at low-altitude, slowly from the NE to the SW (generally in a line from El Jebel, CO towards Mt. Sopris, a 12,900 foot mountain that serves as a handy landmark for residents of the Valley). The sighting lasted for approximately 5 seconds. Although I pointed and yelled, &#34;Look!&#34; no other member of my family saw the object. Observer background: 37-year-old male. B.A. in Anthropology. At the time of the sighting I was a part-time real estate salesperson. My vision is good with eyeglass correction, and my hearing is normal. I was familiar with the neighborhood in which the sighting ocurred as I had lived there for a period of 6 months two years earlier. I revisited the exact spot in the daylight to determine if there were any overhead powerlines that might account for my impressions, but there were none. I had never seen anything like this before that time, and I have not seen anything like it since. I did not report the sighting because I regarded myself as a &#34;bad witness.&#34; I have read about the subject extensively, and I had heard a re-broadcast of Orson Well&#39;s &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; earlier the same day. However, I must report that if I had had to describe what a UFO looked like earlier that same day, it would NOT have been as a silent, black object.<n>

I could clearly make out its shape against the backround of the night sky. There were four people with me who saw the same thing. My best guess was that this object was no-more than a 1000 feet up. I feel uncomfortable of even reporting this event since it happened some time ago and I can&#39;t remember the exact date it happened.<n>
10/25/89 18:45|Endako (Canada)|BC|Unknown|approx: 25 minutes|HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Unusual object which was flying low and parallel to their vehicle along Highway #16.|3/17/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35530.html|3|ndxe198910| Date: Late Fall 1989 Time: 6:45 p.m.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A husband and wife were driving from Endako back to Prince George, British Columbia where they lived. It was early evening and already dark out, they were approximately 8 kilometers east from Endako when the wife pointed out an unusual object which was flying low and parallel to their vehicle along Highway #16.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The husband then slowed the vehicle down so he could get a better look at it. He told me the object, whatever it was, made some quick moments, away from them and back again, also jerking forward and slowing down almost as if it was pacing the car. The object was reported to have changed color a number of times, from a pale green, to red and then blue. There were no flashing lights on the object and the witnesses could not make out its shape due to the darkness of the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The witnesses claim the object stayed with them for a number of miles until they got to a bridge which crosses the Stellako River which is west from Fraser Lake, British Columbia. When the driver and passenger changed direction in their vehicle they lost sight of the object as it seemed to continue on its flight path straight east ward. The couple did pull over to the side of the road to see if they might be able to get a better look, but when they got out of the car the object had disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thank you to the witness for the report  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

All lights shot into sky getting smaller and smaller until so far away you could not see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On my way to Mount SAC college from Costa Mesa in the early evening, my ex-wife and I where on the 57 highway going about 60 MPH. I was distracted by a very intense light by the horizon on the hills where ther are no houses or roads. This very intense disc of light made is way over the side of the 57 highway and was causing cars to start pulling over to side of the road on both roads. It would come closer and lower and then go back up and farther away. It took me about a minute to stop the car and get out. By that time it was gone. The way it disapeared was very strange. It shot up into differnt spots in the sky that were not to distant, however; Every time it would move it would go from a complete stop to an increadable speed in an instant. It would also go from an increadible speed to a complete stop in an instant. At the end it seemed to break up into about 8 distinct balls of light that were many miles up in the air. I am very good with estimating speed and acceleration of jets and rockets. I would estimate that this object must have accelerated to a speed of 10,000 MPH in a fraction of a second only to come to a complete stop and accelerate again on a vector that was in the opposite direction. I know that this was not any aircraft or lightning. I know many others had seen it. I have recently stopped mentioned it to people, because most people either dont care or think that I am not correct.<n>

I looked up and saw a silver glow in the sky.  It was  shaped like a butane tank but maybe the size of three traincars.  It was just over the tree line. I slowed down and pulled over. and then like a shot it went stright up and turn to the west and was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I looked over at my son and asked if he had seen that. He said woo mom what was that thing.  He was 18 at the time.  I am a nurse and my husband at the time worked for nasa.<n> <n><n> <n><n> so when we got back home I asked him if there were any test or flights that he new of for that night. He said no but after telling him what we had seen, he made a call to nasa to see. Thay also said no none at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We nevrer knew what it was but I sill keep looking at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I noticed that the all California World Series was just starting. However being that we didn&#39;t like baseball at the time we decided to turn the t.v. off. As soon as I turned the t.v. off everything went dark and we both heard a noise loud enough to shake the whole house. It sounded like a helicoptor that was trying to turn blades that were way too big for it. Like woosh, woosh, woosh, kind of slowly. Well the sound enough scared us so bad that we ran outside. About a hundred yards above us was a &#34;craft&#34; shaped like a big black kite with red &#34;chaser&#34; lights like on a christmas tree in a cross pattern.this object was about 2 acres big and ascending rapidly when it was about the size of a quarter it took off west very quickly and dissappeared. Both of us were scared and we ran back inside and realized it was 21:30 an neither of us knew what had happened to the last 4 1/2 hours. I was late, I was supposed to be home at 21:00 and since I was at his house and had to walk home. I asked him to walk me halfway and he said no. I wakled home through the woods and arrived at about 22:05 thats when I learned that there had been an earthquake in San Fransisco. For some reason I never discussed it at home or with him at all. Five years later I remembered the incident while having a conversation with my mother. But I still don&#39;t know what happened to the 4 1/2 hours.<n>

Where I lived at the time was quiet dark at night because not many lights were around that area. There was a fair going on at the end of a parking light of a Roses Department Store and Tr-City Mall Forest City, N.C., about 4-5 miles away. I saw a light sort of circling around in the sky and though it might have been from the fair, so I stood there to see behind my house on Farmside Drive Forest City, N.C. This object would travel North East to the mall then back South West toward my house in a circling motion. It did this for a good 20-30 minutes. Then there was another object that begin coming right behind that first one as if was following it. Then after about 10-15 more minutes there was the third that joined in. soon they started getting closer and closer. At one point, they got close straight up above me, over my house. The objects seemed to be Space crafts/U.F.O.&#39;s. In the shuffle of watching these objects I sent a family member in the house to get a camera. When this crafts were above my house I took a snap shot of them as they fled away making my photo sort of blury so I decided to trow it away but, should have kept it. I had frightened them when I took the snap shot and they fled off suddenly leaving a light or smokie trail behind that didn&#39;t last but seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  One of four, seemingly serious-minded, reports from same witness.

I am a private pilot and know that this was not a craft of this world. I have a 5 second mind blank as I saw the craft pass me. I keep seeing that moment over and over, but cannot recall what it did.

The flash originated from a small point , but appeared to &#34;grow&#34; from it. We became very terrified and ran home. I will always remember it because it happened the same evening as the 7.1 Loma Preita earthqauke.<n>

We were both starring straight up into the night sky and saw a triangle shape block out the stars directly above us. It swooped straight down from above just about 100 feet over us. It seemed as if it came from no were, as if it de-cloaked? Suddenly I saw the object&#39;s lights come on in a pattern outlining the triangle. And as quickly as my brain could make out what I was seeing it quickly accelerated off and vanished out of sight. The strange thing is even though the object felt like it was just above us neither of us could hear it. It moved in silents.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of this report elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I assumed that a jet from the airport was making a turn and it&#39;s headlights was shinning on us, so I didn&#39;t  turn to look at it , because i didn&#39;t want to be blinded by it&#39;s light. after a couple of seconds &amp; the light didn&#39;t go away I turned to see why, just as I did  it came in view. it looked like a giant round sphere of fire. It was approxamatly 1000 to 2000 feet in elivation, one half mile south of us, it only took 2 seconds to travel from our local to the top of the south end of the tucson mountains, which it just bearly cleared. It was at least as big or bigger than the U of A football stadium , which seats 50,000 people. it was totaly silent &amp; there was no sonic boom or exhaust trail. being only about an hour after dark in the tucson area, there must have been at least 100,000 people outside , not facing north who couldn&#39;t possibly have not seen it.  for the next two days I monitered the tv news, radio news &amp; newspaper looking for reports, but saw none whatsoever. I researched ball lighting &amp; found it couldn&#39;t be that. nothing in science explained what it could have been .   a year or two later the same phenomenon was reported over southern california, heading from southwest to the northeast toword  area 51. the one i saw was heading basically east to west slightly southeast to northwest.  a couple of years later I was watching a taped video lecture of a young german scientist giving a lecture about WWII Nazi UFO technology &amp; in it he spoke about a perticular sphereicle  craft  that would give the apperance of a giant ball of fire. that was the only thing i have ever heard that sounds like an explanation for what  me &amp; my friends saw. . thank you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This was AFTER is was right behind my parked car.  I was driving back to Anchorage, it was late, and I parked in a rest area about 25 miles from Glennallen, Alaska.  No houses or buildings for several miles from the rest or pull off area.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A large tractor trailer truck, that had not been there when I pulled into the rest area, was there after the bright light (which gave off a loud humming noise) shot off toward the South West.  I had gotton out of the car to try to figure out what was going on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was very suprised to see the truck.  I didn&#39;t hear it come into the rest area, and it was parked 20-30 feet from the front of my Audi sedan.  I ran to the driver&#39;s door on the truck. The driver just looked at me and said something like you see things out here at night that no one would believe, or words to the effect.  I was pretty excitited at the time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This happened 18 years ago.  I had no idea who to tell it to or report it to until seeing something about the National UFO Reporting Center on TV last night on the History Channel.  Also, I was concerned about saying anything to anyone other than my wife as it could have effected my professional life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see what looked like a craft.  The light was so bright and it moved so fast I was simply stunned.  The humming noise was very loud.  I can only descpribe is a &#34;electrical&#34; in nature.  No other way to describe the sound other than the volume.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe there is more to this.  However, in an effort to keep from sounding like I&#39;m crazy I will leave this report as is.  It was the strangest experience of my life.  I do not drink or do drugs.  Never have.  It would be possible for someone to think I was under the influance after giving the full details of the incident.  I don&#39;t believe I was abducted.  However, the truck and driver and electrical problems (which cured themselves) with the car would tend to make it look like I was abducted or came close.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day I have no idea what happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Low Flight Pattern.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was some time in October of 1989.  My mom &amp; I were driving through our neighborhood, off of Hwy 218.  As we approached our house we saw 3 distinct lights in the sky in the shape of a triangle.  We pulled up into the driveway and got out and walked back down to the street.  We saw the craft moving very slowly from west to east.  It was enormous, maybe the size of a football field.   It made no noise and seemed to block out the sky behind it.  It floated right above the treetops until it disappeared from our sight behind other houses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> WSOCTV news that evening reported that they had received calls of similar UFO sightings.

Myself, my brother and 3 friends where watching television in our family room. Which backs to a wrap around deck and then to the woods. To describe the room is easy, think of an open sunroom just enclosed with windows instead of screens. About 3 feet off the top of the decks flooring we saw a Blue sphere approximately an inch or 2 bigger than a tennis ball. Its seemed to come directly from the woods. Then it stopped in a stationary position outside on the deck in front of the window and then after 10-15 seconds broke into about 5 pieces all in the shape of a sphere and disappeared.<n>

It was so beautiful it was kinda shine, and it kinda looked like what you see on tv but it was one solid object, it looked seemless. it was dark so it is hard to remember all the details, but it did have lights on the bottom. it shot up in the air about 50 feet and stop dead in its tracks then it moved to the right and stoped. then it moved to the left and stoped. and then it shot out of sight in a blink of an eye.  I thought that we were the only ones to see it but there where other people who people who saw it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date apparently is approximate.  PD))<n>

I am sorry I dont know the date and am sorry that I am now reporting a 9 year old sighting.  But I finally found your website.  I started getting alot of calls about lights in the sky.  Between songs, I looked out the window and saw them too, creeping slowing across the sky, almost like a blimp, but with many colors, green, red, white, etc.  Continue at full description below...<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I watched this large thing with flashing lights slowly move across the sky north of Morgantown West Virginia.  I am undertain of the exact date but I think it was on a warm fall Friday or Saturday night.  The lights were almost in the shape of a triangle, like a fat arrowhead.  They were not perfectly outlining the object but instead appeared somewhat at random.  The object would be stationary, then rise, and then move forward slowly again.  This went on for about 20 minutes.  I even announced it on the radio and I got even more calls from people who also saw it.  Finally, I went back to the window and it was gone about 20 minutes after I got the first call.  That is it.<n>

I was alone and driving west on IL Route 81. At a few minutes after 9:00pm I was approximately 4 miles west of Kewanee on a section of Route 81 running north (near the intersection of Tower Road). On the right (east) are hills and broken timbers amongst pastures and on the left (west) are flat open tilled farm fields. I would have been traveling north. I suddenly noticed a reddish-orange flashing light. At the time, I thought an emergency vehicle or deputy sheriff had suddenly come up behind me. This happened without warning and I thought a vehicle had approached me without any headlights. I had not been drinking or using any drugs. I do recall being somewhat fatigued after a long and busy day. I slowed down and moved the vehicle over to the shoulder of the road. As I came to a stop on the shoulder of the road, I was still thinking I was being pulled over for some reason. I stepped out of the open driver’s side door and realized that a large glowing sphere was positioned almost directly overhead. I estimated the object to be approx 50-70ft above the ground and approximately 20-25ft in diameter. It was smooth and glassy appearing on its surface, which was most noticeable between the brighter intensity pulses. I want to emphasize that these &#34;pulses&#34; were not flashes as in on-off but were pulsations of brighter-dimmer, never shutting off completely. I also noticed a strong definite static field that increased in unison with the pulses of brighter light. I could not visualize the surface of the object when the light pulses were at peak intensity. During the less intense/dim phase of the light pulses the surface was clearly visible and totally featureless from my point of view. The surface was very smooth and glass-like transparent and within appeared a swirling, smoky, or viscous liquid type substance against the inner surface. From what was visible to me, I would insist this object was a perfect globe or sphe! re and e mitted light from its entire outside surface. Over the next 1-2 minutes the quality and duration of the bright/dim light cycle changed to a longer bright and shorter dim but the frequency of the light cycle seemed constant. It did not pulse faster, just longer and brighter pulses with shorter dim intervals until it became a constant steady light. I hope I can make this clearly understood. I could feel the intensity of the static field intensify also. I did not move from my position next to the truck between the open door and cab. I had the feeling that something was going to happen with the changes in the light emissions and static field but did not know what to expect. When the light pulses became a steady light, the object very suddenly shot west with a departure so rapid that there was a loud “pop.” I can only describe it as being like a huge cork violently pulled from a bottle. I was aware of no noise prior to this moment. The object stopped very suddenly in the western sky for a few seconds (3-5 miles away?) then seemed to change direction approximately 90 degrees to due north a couple miles, stopping suddenly again for only a moment then disappearing to the western horizon. My next recollection was the realization that I was sitting in my parked truck in my backyard (approximately 2 miles north of the site described) with the truck pointing west and watching the western sky where the object disappeared. This was not an area where I would typically park. I walked into the house a few minutes before 11:00pm. Evidently, I was in the truck for some time. It was a very pleasant evening and I recall an overall feeling of &#34;stunned amazement&#34;. I do not recall ever feeling fear or apprehension. I realize that some time is unaccounted for.  I have attributed that to some kind of emotional shock. I have remained in excellent health.<n>

I slowed and moved over to the shoulder of the road. As I came to a stop on the shoulder I was still thinking I was being pulled over for some reason. I then realized the red or red/orange light was reflecting in the space between the back window of the truck and the topper. I shut the engine off at this point thinking I had some kind of electrical problem with some lights on the new and unfamiliar truck topper. I shut the engine off and opened the driver&#39;s door at about the same moment I realized the light was also reflected on the hood of the truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I stepped out of the open drivers door to stand on the ground and realized that a large glowing sphere was positioned almost directly overhead.

10/10/89 21:00|Centralia|WA|Triangle|1 minute|A huge triangularly shaped silent object that blotted out 25 degrees of the sky, lighted by four glowing points.|4/27/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/036/S36137.html|28|ndxe198910| A huge triangularly shaped silent object that blotted out 25 degrees of the sky, lighted by four glowing points.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An old sighting.  I was a System Analysis for SAC in the early 1960 and stationed at Ellsworth AFB, SD.   I have held the nation&#39;s highest security clearance, take no drugs, am a tea toddler and have never hallucinated in my life. During this same time I frequently rode to and from the Minuteman silos, in South Dakota, on HP helicopters.  So I have seen these aircraft up close and personal on many occasions.  I have thus a many year experience with B-52s at close and medium ranges.  In the late 60s I had many personal experiences with the C-5A in Georgia, where they were being designed and built.   About this same time I saw the Blackbird at Elgin AFB, Fla.  So when I say that what I saw over my home in Washington state early one winter night in the late 1980s or early 1990s wasn&#39;t a miliary or civilian aircraft of any known type, I am speaking with some authority.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw as a very large, slowly moving delta shaped object that blotted out at least 30 degrees of the nighttime sky.  The object was moving from the SSW and headed, thus, towards the NNE.  This is an occasional glide path for some military aircraft head from Macord AFB, in Tacoma, about 40 NNE of my home.  The object was about 20 degrees above the horizon, but appeared to move upwards as it passed nearly overhead.  My young son, Max, then about eight, i.e., c. 1990, was with me.  We were both in my hot tub which was located about fifty feet behind and to the West of my home at ((address deleted)) Rd, Centralia, WA.  It would have been early evening about 8 or 9 PM., PST.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object had lights at the front and &#34;wing&#34; tips, clearly making the &#34;Delta&#34; shape easy to see.  What was so curious about the object was it&#39;s size and the total silence of it&#39;s travel.  I have never seen a larger object in the sky.  Keep in mind that I have frequently seen both B-52s and C-5As takeoff at close range, i.e., right over my head and at very low altitudes.  At these altitudes these aircraft must be using full power to stay airborne and are thus quite loud.  This object, however seemed to be &#34;floating&#34; though it was obviously not a balloon.  I would describe the propulsion as &#34;gravitational&#34; rather than aerodynamic.  There was no hint of the roar of these jets nor was there any sound similar to a helicopter or copters. No &#34;thump/thump&#34; of blades.   I would say that this object was at least the size of a C-5A, right on the deck.  However if the object was at five thousand feet, far more likely, given my impression of the object and the cloud cover that evening, which was broken with the ceiling at about 5,000 feet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So if the object was at 5,000 ft, &#34;gliding&#34; slowly over head, it would have been many times larger than any C-5A.  Indeed this was my impression of this &#34;craft.&#34;  The entire time I had it in sight, not long, only about one minute, my impression was of *hugeness*.  The object seem to be at least a thousand feet across.   It is easy to give the impression of size.  The object was as large as the oak tree that stands near the hot tub and pool in the back ward.  This tree covers about 25 degrees of the sky from the tub.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I add that the lights were not aircraft lights.  They were not flashing, they were not port and starboard, red and green lights,. they were white, but not sealed beams pointing down, as they would have illuminated us as they passed &#34;overhead&#34;.   The &#34;glowed.&#34;   I say &#34;overhead&#34; because it missed being directly overhead by what appeared to be a few hundred feet, i.e., it appeared to be over my barn and not over my hot tub.<n> <n><n> <n><n> These could not have been separate objects, because the entire sky was blotted out between them.  The stars and clouds disappeared between them and this &#34;area&#34; moved with the lights as the light moved.  I could not see any metallic &#34;underside,&#34; just darkness.  Now this entire thing is complicated by the fact that I was not wearing my glasses.  So I would not be able to see much detail.  I can easily make out the planets, first, second and third magnitude stars.  I would say these lights were at least of the brightness of Venus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My son, however, has normal sight and I had him give me a running narrative.  He saw no detail between the lights and clearly confirmed that the entire sky was blacked out between them.  I have reported the sighting.  NPR carried the report, nation wide, since I heard from former friends, a few years after it happened, when I attended a public meeting on UFO&#39;s at the local library (Centralia, WA).<n> <n><n> <n><n> During those years I kept a daily planner and have preserved them, so I could, no doubt pin point the date with some luck and time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have requested that the source of the report attempt to get in touch with some of the other witnesses.  PD))<n>

I was riding my motorcycle home on Mulholland highway heading east after leaving Las Virgenes road (headed toward the San Fernando Valley). About 1/4 of a mile east of Las Virgenes road (heading east on Mulholland highway) I noticed a red light in the sky south of the road. This light stayed far away from me but kept pace for awhile. The light then very quickly shot north from where it had been and stopped directly over me and at the same time my motorcycle engine died causing my motorcycle to stop. It happened so quick that I remember looking up and noticed a ring of red lights glowing and absolutely no noise at all. I also noticed that whatever I was looking at blotted out the stars and was very large. I estimate that it was about maybe eight stories above me. I also remember kicking the engine over on my motorcycle but it would not start. The object stayed above me for awhile and then still making absolutely no noise shot straight up into the sky getting smaller and smaller until it disappeared. As soon as the object was gone my motorcycle started when kicked over and I continued home. I have not told many people about this incident and to this day am not sure what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

It was a clear night with all the shining stars, and we were very far away from our camp site and nothing else was visible around our camp area, we were alone in this location. The area was really flat with no sand dunes around. While we were walking my friend was looking at the sky when he stopped suddenly, and i told him what&#39;s wrong and he said look up there and i saw a round shape very bright red colour the size of a football moving staight slowly then stopped, then start moving again but in zigzag pattern like, then stopped again, then went backwards straight and increased it&#39;s speed that in 2 sec it vanished. We were amazed by this sight and to be  honest i was a little scared after the sighting. When we got back to camp none of our friends believed us and told us you were imagining so i didn&#39;t take it seriously, so i didn&#39;t bother much in mentioning about this for a long time.Who knows maybe it was really a U.F.O.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was probably between 9:30 and 10pm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> She looked out of her bedroom window and saw a large, gray object with a dome top and one or more rows of white lights around the lower edge. There was one very bright light illuminating the path ahead of the object, which was flying &#34;just high enough to clear the tree tops&#34; --  (probably 50-75 feet above ground level) She estimated it to be &#34;about the size of an average house.&#34;  What struck her most was that the object made absolutely no noise, and was traveling too slowly to be an airplane. The bedroom window faces due north, and the flight path was south, toward the house. When the craft passed over the house she ran to a back window to see if she could catch another glimpse, but she saw it just for a second as it disappeared behind the tree line and disappeared.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My sister was slightly shaken by the incident, but did not tell anyone about the sighting for years because she feared ridicule. She eventually told me and one or two others.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have heard many accounts of sightings.  This one is unique because I do not believe it would be possible for my sister to imagine or create what she described.  She has always been a very down-to-earth, responsible, and realistic person. She is a college graduate with a degree in Human Development, was the director of a private pre-school for several years, and is currently a Case Worker for a Social Services Agency.  She was a popular, well-behaved high school student with good grades and had no reason to seek attention. (She doesn&#39;t even like science fiction!)  The only nearby military airports are unlikely to be involved in experimental aviation. There is an ANG refueling wing at KBGR (8 miles) operating KC-135 aircraft, and a Medical unit with Huey and Bell helicopters. Brunswick Naval Air Station is nearly 100 miles away.

10/1/89 21:30|Carmichael|CA|Rectangle|10sec.|Black rectangular craft over carmichael.|7/25/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38161.html|33|ndxe198910| Black rectangular craft over carmichael.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occured in the fall of 1989. I was working at what was then HomeDepot as a &#34;runner&#34;. It was around 9:15-9:30pm, closing time, and I was responsible for &#34;shagging&#34; shopping carts out of the parking lot. Typically during business hours the parking lot flood lights are on to help customers get to there cars. After closing time the lights are turned off at this particular site. While I was out tracking down some carts I happened to look up and noticed a black, rectangular object silently fly directly over head. The object was all black with no running lights. The object made no sound. It appeared very smooth as I did not view any surface features. In fact the only way I noticed it was from the reflection of the street/city lights off the bottom of the craft. I would say the craft was anywhere from 500-1000ft from the ground and maybe 100-150ft across. It was a clear night and the craft was as black as the night sky if not slightly darker. It was heading due North. The whole event lasted about 10secs. Another point of interest is that McClellan AFB is about 1-2 miles west of sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

It was moving back and forth from south to north, north to south.  I turned into the driveway of my home and continued watching it. After a short time two more circle shaped lights came out from each side of the first one looking like they might have come from within or perhaps from behind it. The three lights commenced doing a formation moving in slow patterns. Then they shot away as if in warp drive one after the other the northern most shooting first to the north, then the middle and south most following it disappearing suddenly almost right after. The incident lasted around five minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A day or two after it was reported in the paper that others had seen a UFO in a nearby town that same night, unfortunately I can’t remember the date or time of the incident since it was way back in the eighties and I am a non-linear person. It was probably between 7 to nine pm and it seems like it was fall weather.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

It had lights all over the underside.  People I told later said it was a &#34;laser show&#34; that had been talked about in a local paper.  It was a Tuesday night and they said they were shown every Tuesday night.  I have not to this day been able to ascertian whether any other witnesses exist but I continue to think about it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate; provides a paucity of contact information.

10/1/89 18:00|Ft. Walton Beach|FL|Circle|20 min.|As a law enforcement officer I was dispatched to a UFO sighting near a military base.|3/31/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/062/S62294.html|36|ndxe198910| As a law enforcement officer I was dispatched to a UFO sighting near a military base.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event took place while I was a deputy shereff several years before I retired.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was dispatched to a UFO sighting in the west end of the county. Once I arrived there were several people standing by the road looking up at the UFO. It was round about the size of two football fields. The color was much like the center of an egg.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO remained stationary. Every few seconds a small UFO would drop from the center of the mother ship. It would hover for a moment then dart of at a high rate of speed. This was taking place within a mile of one of the highest security military bases in the country and within 12 miles of another secure base. I call dispatch and ask if they would call both bases and let me know it they knew what this UFO was and if they could see it. I knew the one base could not help but see it. Being only one mile from the base they would have been able to see same from there flight tower. After all sources had been checked no one admitted to seeing or knowig anything about the UFO. I did not think much of it at the time for one simple reason. There was no way the two bases could not have know about this UFO. When I call this a UFO I mean it in the truest form. I did not know what it was, but given its location I knew good and well the military knew what it was. Because of this I took it to be something from earth. Now after all these years I still believe it was not from outer space. It was an amazing sight. To see this huge round stationary UFO located at about 1,000 ft with these small round UFOs dropping from under the belly of the mother UFO and darting off at great speed in every direction was a sight to behold. What was it, I have no idea, but I do know this much. The nearest base could not help but see this object. The point is they knew what is was snd were not about to tell lawenforcement anything. After about 20 min. the mother took of and vanished from sight. At that point I went back on patrol.<n>
10/1/89 18:00|Winchester (near)|KY|Oval|5 minutes|3 starlike objects land on 1 large orange oval object in full daylight in sight of dozens of witnesses.|3/11/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/049/S49186.html|37|ndxe198910| 3 starlike objects land on 1 large orange oval object in full daylight in sight of dozens of witnesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am not a &#34;true believer&#34;. I am not an idiot. I do not believe in anything in which I do not have conclusive proof, which is almost exclusivly for me, my own eye witness memories. I am now 31 years old (as of 2006). It was the year of 1989 and I was 15. I saw somthing in broad daylight which was so obvious and easy to see, that many cars on the Mountain Parkway Toll road on the northern edge of the smoky mountains, had parked on the side of the highway to sit apon the hoods of their cars and watch! My mother was driving, and my little sister was the first to spot the spectacle. It was near 6:00pm and the sun was low and orange in the sky. It was that kind of sun that you can look right at even though it is still fully in the sky.When I looked I was only curious at first to figure out what this thing was. It appeared as the shape of an almond with the soft &#34;points&#34; being vertical and the color was almost the same as the sun which was in a completely different place in the sky. I put forth a guess that the sun did give this object it&#39;s color. Like a reflection of sorts. What I witnessed next along with dozens of parked bystanders and my sister and mother was incredible. Almost instantly there where three small shiny objects appearing identical to normal stars moving around very near the large oval shaped object. Next, one at a time, the small objects moved to the top &#34;tip&#34; of the oval and disappeared, as if they had landed on it  and turned off or went inside it!! At this exact time we were going around the circular exit ramp to Interstate Highway 64. Once we were on the new highway going straight I regained a good viewing position only to see that the object had turned on it&#39;s side so that it looked more like a giant human eye. It then started to slowly move, I think. For as we went straight, it seemed to move from right to left across our path. The way it was moving and the way it appeared as we changed roads  led me instinctively to presume that it was not a far distant object like the moon. It only move slowly for 10 seconds or so before it disappeared or moved away so fast that I did not see it happen. Please keep in mind that it was a bright clear evening and I have near sighted eyes, however my sister has perfect vision. She sketched many drawings that evening. That&#39;s all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
