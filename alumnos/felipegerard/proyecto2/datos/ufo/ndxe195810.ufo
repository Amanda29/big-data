10/30/58 01:00|Riverside|IL|Light|10 minutes (?)|Chicago suburbs, strange lights and figures; close contact with figures. 500 Lights On Object0: Yes|4/27/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/055/S55814.html|1|ndxe195810| Chicago suburbs, strange lights and figures; close contact with figures.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> This event occurred when I was approximately 5 years old; as such it is an old memory that may be partially &#34;contaminated&#34; by the intervening years, but it remains, nevertheless, a very vivid memory for me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents were driving home after visiting relatives. It was late (after midnight) and I was trying to sleep in the back seat of the car. The weather was getting cold that time of year, so all the car windows were rolled-up. We were traveling through an area that was only partially developed at the time--a heavily forested road, or forest preserve land, near Riverside IL--when my father abruptly stopped the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sat up, thinking that we had almost crashed, and looked out the front window. Indistinct shapes moved around a bright light at what seemed like some sort of accident, but I could not see any other crashed cars. My mother kept saying something like, &#34;What is that? What are they doing there?&#34; The light extended completely across the narrow road and was a brilliant amber-yellow color with other spectral shades in it . . . like the rainbow hues glimpsed along the edge of a beveled mirror. My mother was talking very fast and nervously and I could tell she was becomming upset. She kept insisting that my father back-up the car and get &#34;hell out of here.&#34; My dad shouted back, &#34;I&#39;m trying!&#34; but the car wouldn&#39;t move. My mom became hysterical when some of the figures turned toward us and started approaching the car.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I watched I became aware of a presence alongside the car near me on the passenger side. The glare from the light, which now seemed all around us like an enveloping  fog, partially obscured him. This figure seemed to indicate to me that he wanted me to open the car door. When I reached up and raised the door &#34;button&#34;, my mother began to scream uncontrollably: &#34;Don&#39;t let them in, DON&#39;T LET THEM IN!&#34; I was unable to see any distinct features of the figures because of the glare around the car but, nevertheless, I could not understand her fear. One figure in particular seemed to want to play with me. He seemed older than me, but behaved just like a funny, playful older sibling. He projected this tremendous sense of warmth and affection toward me that I grasped immediately on a gut emotional level. No fear at all.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The last thing I remember was a monotonous buzzing sound as if the entire rear car window had been covered with insects. (I actually have what may be a screen memory of a thick blanket of buzzing flies entirely obscuring the view from the car&#39;s back window.) The car door opened and someone lifted me out. At first I thought this was my father, but it was not; the figure who lifted me was featureless, like a living shadow, without any discernable face. My body went limp, like someone who was asleep, only I was still conscious . . .  but it was as if I were outside of my own body, watching all this happening from a safe distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I woke up the next morning at home in my bed surprised and confused about how I got there. When I asked my mother about the incident she simply said nothing had happened. To this day she either flatly refuses to discuss the incident or claims she has absolutely no recollection of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a university lecturer. My father is deceased. My elderly mother lives with a 24-hour caregiver.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
10/25/58 20:00|Terrebonne|OR|Unknown|1-2 minutes|Piercing, shrill tone.|8/5/12|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/091/S91176.html|2|ndxe195810| Piercing, shrill tone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> #1.   I was in the fifth grade, age 10, was learning to play the  Trombone and thought it to be “neat” to play TAPS, outside, at night.  I had been doing it for weeks (maybe months) when in the middle of my playing I heard a shrill, high pitched sound with a slight warble, (a fast warble) that scared the s*#! out of me!  I was absolutely PETRIFIED, and couldn&#39;t even move!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After what seemed like minutes, which was probably only a few seconds, I forced my body to move, first with one foot, then the other, to open the house door and once inside, made a streak to the living room where my sister and mother were located.  They knew from the “white complexion” and big eyes that I WAS NOT JOKING!   At the time, they did not truly believe that what I was telling them was a fact, or just a little boy hearing “noises”.  They suggested that one of our three dogs was “howling” at my Trombone escapades. Even at the age of 10 years I&#39;d heard many a dog howl.....THAT NOISE WASN&#39;T EVEN CLOSE IN SOUND to a dog&#39;s howl.  The sheer intensity, evenness and consistency of that sound WAS NOT A DOG!<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a short time, my mother and sister persuaded me to go back outside with them.  Even to this day, I know they think they “know better” than the kid.  However, they do realize and admit that I was scared to the point of “looking like a ghost”! That “little incident” was enough to curtail my evening “TAPS” playing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> P.S. We were living about 5 miles north of Terrebonne, Oregon, a rural farming community in central Oregon.  The time was about 8:00 P.M.  It was sometime in October and Dad was gone from home, elk hunting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  One of five reports from the same source, with whom we have spoken on the telephone, on several occasions.  The witness strikes us as being quite sober-minded, and we suspect he is an excellent witness, and quite reliable.  Once his reports are posted to our website, we will provide links to all of his sighting reports.  PD))<n>
10/20/58 21:00|St. Paul|MN|Other|2 seconds|A dull-orange craft sped southbound at low altitude and high speed toward the general direction of the airport.|3/16/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12253.html|3|ndxe195810| A dull-orange craft sped southbound at low altitude and high speed toward the general direction of the airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was October of 1958, and I had been out collecting for my paper route. (In those days, paper boys collected the bill from customers monthly, in person. I usually quit collecting for the evening around 9:00pm.) Rather than going straight into the house when I got home, I decided to get on my bike and amble somewhere. I started traveling down the alley at a slow pace - going nowhere in particular - and I saw the glow from the lights of the college football field, and decided to head over there and check the score of the game. I gazed upward and noticed that the night was filled with stars; it was absolutely clear and pristine. What a knock-your-socks-off beautiful night! I looked forward again, down the pitch black alley, and I suddenly saw a strange, dull-orange craft streak across the sky, over the football field, heading southbound, parallel to Snelling Avenue. It appeared like 2 bat-wings cut out of an orange paper plate, with 3 sides in total (front, back of left wing, back of right wing), and all sides smooth and rounded, except the tips which had normal points. Its altitude was perhaps 300 feet. Viewing time was perhaps 2 seconds. I could easily tell: It wasn&#39;t from &#34;around here&#34;. I slammed on the brakes of my bike, and just stood there in the dark stillness of the night, realizing that I had just seen my second UFO, and that I couldn&#39;t prove it to a single soul... There had been no other witnesses that I know of. The stars kept shining, and the crowd watching the game would occasionally cheer, and the traffic kept moving up and down Snelling as the people went about their business, scurrying to and fro... Years later, around 1978 or so, I was watching a documentary movie on TV called &#34;Flying Saucers Are Real&#34; or something like that, when I saw an account of a UFO encounter by an Army helicopter. This happened in Ohio, when a Lt. Col. Coyne and his crew were effortlessly pulled up several thousand feet by a large ship. An artist had made colored drawings, based on Coyne&#39;s testimony (he went public with it). It was an enormous, gray, metallic hulk of hi-tech engineering, and it had a dark red design on the nose which I recognized. The design was a kind of 4-pronged &#34;splat&#34;, or jelly-fish, or thick cross-hairs, which if viewed from the side, appeared to be a kind of bat wing, or unusual flying wing (not like the Northrup flying wings). I suddenly realized that what I&#39;d seen back in October of 1958 was POSSIBLY the nose art of a much larger craft. What appeared to me like a large, orange craft, had possibly just been the tip of the iceberg of a MUCH larger, huge, gray, silent piece of engineered metal... Either way, it was big, fast and silent.<n>
