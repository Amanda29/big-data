2/27/81 10:00|Azusa|CA|Light|3minets|I! I found out!|11/21/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78511.html|1|ndxe198102| I! I found out!<n> <n><n> <n><n> We went camping to the top of the East fork in Azusa Canyon.  Me and my friend were unloading the firewood then asked me what is that?  I looked up to what he pointed to and I saw stars and what looked like a star but moving at a steady pace. I told him it was probably a satellite and just as soon as the words left my mouth it changed directions and hyper spaced away.  It was at first traveling from East to West and then shot off North.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was susceptible about other life forms. That day changed my mind.  With all these sitings, even the one in Riverside, CA.  I witnessed three orbs that early evening and so did 100&#39;s of people, but Uncle Sam told us it was weather balloons!<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next day they appeared again this time instead of lights they were clear orbs but did not move like the afternoon before.  Our government is being secretive.  Why did they stop investigating UFO&#39;s  and abduction?<n>
2/23/81 21:00|Cameron|NC|Light|15 min.|Round object hovering in sky then in a zig zag motion dissapering|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04294.html|2|ndxe198102| Round object hovering in sky then in a zig zag motion dissapering<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was reterning home from a church meeting when she spotted what she thought was a UFO.She whached it a while then decided to come get us.She franticly rushed my father,sister and me to the car.To her disbelief the object was still there.I saw a round light about the same lightness and size of the moon hovering above a feild app.400feet above the ground. I notice it made no noise and was staying exactly still. After about 10 min. it moved directly over us and sat another 5 min. I was scared because I knew this was not swamp gas or any type of aircraft because it was to together and made no noise,and we where in the country 5 miles from a major highway and10 miles from a town.It then moved away from us and zig-zaged 4 times then went away in a twinkle of light.The zig-zag was fast and was perfectly shaped,about 45 degree turns with no curve so it could not have been a airplane.And when it dissappered it was like a burst of light like on star trek when they hit warp speed. That is my story and it will stay with me forever .I&#39;m not sold on extra-trestrials but I can,t explain what I saw.<n>
2/20/81 14:00|Flint|MI||5 minutes|Beams of light on a cloudy afternoon|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42355.html|3|ndxe198102| Beams of light on a cloudy afternoon<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was inside a building, on the telephone to a friend. Outside was a normal cloudy February day. There was an extremely bright flash of light at the front window.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Two very brite figures stood in the front room, and suddenly became 2 beams of light. They moved towards the back room to where I was on the phone. They were as bright as lightning, whitish on top and red underneath. One passed very near to where I stood. It slowed, and I was tempted to put my hand out to touch it, but didn&#39;t. The beam then continued out the other end of the room. I told my friend what was happening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I did not see a UFO, as the sky was full of clouds; but, have always wondered where the bright flash and beams could have come from. This location was also about 4 miles from Bishop Airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Any sightings about this time and area?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
