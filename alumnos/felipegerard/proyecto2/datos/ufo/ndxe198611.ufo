It was before dawn, and I was sitting by a tree, bored and looking up at the sky.  It was a clear morning (plenty of stars).  First I saw an airplane go by, lights flashing, and I followed it until it disappeared over the trees.  Maybe a minute later, in the North portion of the sky, I saw a slow, very visible object.  The object was shaped like a pyramid, and was lit up with large, round blue lights all along the bottom (one light at the front, two in the middle, and three along the rear).  I couldn&#39;t see the sides, but  red lights glowed enough to give them definition, and it left a faint red trail.  The object took its time going by, and made no noise at all.  It also, for some reason seemed to be very high, but very large.  It kept moving in a straight line and disappeared beyond the tree line.  Later I asked my Dad if he had seen it, and he said he hadn&#39;t.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that time I was around 15 years old.  I remember it clearly now, 15 years later.  I have watched those UFO specials hoping to see something like what I had seen, but never have.  I have not seen one like it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a college graduate (a B.A. in english), and I work as a department manager at a local music store.<n>
11/21/86 18:30|North Laguna Beach|CA|Disk|6 min.|Pie pan bottom; disc top craft played with the airspace above Irvine ranch reveiling displacement of matter.|2/1/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/054/S54044.html|2|ndxe198611| Pie pan bottom; disc top craft played with the airspace above Irvine ranch reveiling displacement of matter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Driving S/B on CA 1, sunset at 100degrees over my right shoulder, just at the N.Laguna beach across from the Irvine ranch open range, above the far hills to the S.E. I noticed a spot of black growing larger until it was directly above the trees of the hilltops I could see from the S/B right lane.  I thought it might be a helicoper ranching, but it was not.  It was metallic silver and panshaped on the bottom rounded top disc. No lights that i noticed in the sunshine reflecting off of it; it was very clearly a disc.  When above the treeline it seemed to force the trees to bend away from the craft as it approched and the tree tops just brushed underneith lower at center and finally swayed when the tops left the area around the ship.  As if the ship had a strong and large area of space that displaced the matter of our world.  This effect was at least as wide as the entire ship and maybe as much as 2 X the width of the ships appearance.  It seemed to be heading directly toward me after it&#39;s traversing the hilltop in a N.W. travel that was aproxamately 3 miles distance and from where i was 2 miles away toward the N.E.  When it was directly East it traveled toward the Sun right over my moving vehicle.  Before it got to the road it filled my windshild by about 15 percent so it was very close and slowed hovering there.  I thought to myself and to anyone capable of perceiving my thoughts these words/thoughts.  &#34;I will never belive what I am seeing if You do not do something out of the ordinary with your craft.  Please, show me a manuver other than this to be sure I understand You wish me to see this.&#34;  At that momment the ship moved to flatten the bottom of the craft so that I could witness the entire bottom of the pie pan shape exposed flatly and now encompassing 1/4 of the windshield.  It was round perfectly circular with the lower flat portion appearing as a smaller circle inside it.  It proceeded to float like a leaf falling from a tree, with a regular back and forth flutter of side to side fl! ipping m otion without changing it&#39;s slow steady pace or speed Westward over the car which suddenly affected the radio transmission as a white noise garble, and causing a bit of a studder to the sound of the engine of the car.  The car did not stop, but i was slowed to about 40mph from a 70mph pace by this time.     I noticed the disc in my window as a speck in the rear right side window traveling under the sun toward the horizon exactly to the West out to the Pacific Ocean and disappeared from sight in about 2 seconds from the passing above the roof of my automobile out of my sight to the resighting of it toward its&#39; vanishing point in the Western distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Vanished after I came closer to it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking home at night the sky was very clear due to the cold weather.  The night sky was inky purple.  I observed a boomerang shaped object the perimeter of which was dotted with green lights.  My hometown was very small and quiet.  I heard no noise whatsoever.  I continued to observe the object and found myself actually running towards it to get a better look.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once I was out from underneath the street light I was in a position to see it better I held my breath so the water vapor would not obstruct my view.  The object remained totally motionless.  I estimate it was 500 to 1,000 feet from the ground.  I watched it for about a minute and the green &#34;marker&#34; lights on the outer edges went out starting with the &#34;lead&#34; light than the #1 port side, #2, #3 etc... until the last light on the starboard site turned off and the object was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was the one and only &#34;unexplainable&#34; thing I&#39;ve seen first hand.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

11/15/86 21:00|Savannah|GA|Light|3 to 5 minutes|I saw a "star" that moved about in a very strange, rapid manner the night sky over Savannah, Georgia late in 1986|6/18/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29229.html|4|ndxe198611| I saw a &#34;star&#34; that moved about in a very strange, rapid manner the night sky over Savannah, Georgia late in 1986<n> <n><n> <n><n> One cold night in November of 1986, I had gone to the roof of my dorm building in Savannah, Georgia (When I was a student at Savannah College of Art and Design there) to sit back, away from the din of noise of other students inside the building below me, to listen to a cassette tape of music and just look at the stars as I had often done.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hadn&#39;t been there but a couple of minutes when I saw what looked like the most amazing meteor entering the atmosphere. It was very bright and distinct and traveled from east to west almost traversing the entire sky. When it got to the far western region of the sky it began to dim and then it did something I wasn&#39;t ready for, it stopped cold.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At first I thought I had lost it behind a bright star or that my eyes had picked up a star instead. And then the &#34;star&#34; moved again. From an absolute stopped point, it streaked from it&#39;s resting point in the west to a point up and behind my head in the south (I was sitting facing due north). At this point I had to sit up and had turned my head to follow this &#34;Star&#34; as I had not been prepared for this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Amazingly, right after stopping for about a count of 3 to 5 seconds, the &#34;star&#34; moved very abruptly from it&#39;s position in the south to one to the far north eastern sky and stopped again. At this point I remember thinking that this wasn&#39;t right. Stars don&#39;t do this. It was new to me to ever see anything like this and I don&#39;t think I was aware yet that I was seeing a UFO as it were, I just was so blown away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After a few moments where it was, the &#34;star&#34; shot off to the south again aand was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was so blown away that I just sort of slumped back down and lay there stunned. I actually remember feeling very scared and felt like I wasn&#39;t supposed to have seen that or something. People always say that they want to see a UFO and it had never occurred to me that it would scare the crap out of me. I was so scared, lying there exposed on that rooftop, that I remember I couldn&#39;t move for what seemed like a long time. It may have just been minutes, but it seemed like a very long time. A deer in the headlights effect I guess.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I finally got my wits together and left the roof very rapidly and went inside to tell my friends what I saw. The most frustrating thing about it was that I had been alone and that every single person looked at me with this very condescending smile that made me very angry. I wish anybody else could have seen this amazing thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t now what I saw but I do know that it wasn&#39;t birds in the night lights, or a jet, or anything I have ever seen before or since. It moved very fast and in a way that made no sense. It went from absolute still to absolute motion across the sky in a moment, and stopped just as fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Whatever it was, either we have very amazing machines in thhis world that no one knows about or it was something else. But it was something and it was real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In some ways I hope I never see anything like it again. It makes one feel very small.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I hope that thsi report isn&#39;t too old or anything but it was an amazing thing to see and I felt compelled to tell you this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

11/15/86 14:30|Girdwood|AK|Sphere|2 minutes ?|25 feet from amber, orange orb [1986]  Alaska.|2/4/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96113.html|5|ndxe198611| 25 feet from amber, orange orb [1986]  Alaska<n> <n><n> <n><n> U.F.O  report, NOV. 1986  I was reading the report dated Nov. 7, 2012, Wasilla AK. About some orange orbs . And a lot more reports from all over. Those reports are very similar to what I saw back in Nov.1986 in Girdwood AK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The Wasilla delta report, [ Nov. 7 2012]   from Girdwood, is just over some mountains to the north, about 30 mile as the crow fly’s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What I saw that early morning ,Nov. 1986, being less then 25 feet at its closes point to me   this, single, silent, amber, orange orb , a perfect sphere . Translucent orange bubble with a kind of light  I have never seen. One report I read described the light perfectly. I quote , “ A quality of light had not seen before, a peculiar wavelength” unquote. I’ll add that I noticed that there were no rays of light in the glow of the orb. Look outside at any man made light at night and there will be some rays round it. Not so with this orb. Strange light .<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was sleeping behind a bar in a camper shell .  Got up to relieve my self. Turning my head to the left where my chin was just in front of my left  shoulder . There was the orb, at about 20 feet in diameter, floating at tree top,[15 to 20 ft. high]  From my left, going to my right  down the row of trees that separate the two businesses.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved very slow, until my chin was in front of my right shoulder then took off fast still in a straight line until it was over glacier creek, made a perfect 90 degree turn and straight to Turnagain arm a few miles south.  At that instant the deafening sound of an f-15 after burner shook the ground. The jet followed the path as the orb over the tree tops to glacier creek, but the jet had to cut the corner  to make the turn to pursue the orb.  Then a second f-15 ,shook the ground as its after burner came to life and took the same flight path on the tops of the trees.  It made a tighter turn then the first jet. I guess to make up time .   Those two Jets were so close I could see rivets on the under belly from the parking lot light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A foot note, seemed time was weird or something, stopping,  until the f-15’s appeared .<n>

My husband and I were in the Sierra Nevada Mts between Lake Tahoe and Grass Valley California.  It was about midnight and we were walking on the top of a mountain when suddenly there came a noise that sounded somewhat like a very loud generator engine.  Doug and I discussed the possible origin of the noise, concluding that there were no buildings within two miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The noise became louder and louder as I looked into the sky to see a circular object just above the tree tops (probably 60-80 feet).   We never saw the top of the craft, but clearly saw six bright white circular lights shining from it&#39;s bottom surface and it was probably fifty feet in diameter .	The craft hovered above us for less than one minute and during that time Doug and I both ran downhill as quickly as we could.  I was not watching the craft as it departed, but did hear the noise end as quickly as it had started just about two to three minutes earlier.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Reading some of the recent events reminded me of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was walking down the street and off to the west, toward the mountains I saw the large glowing blue spherical objects arc across the sky and then vanish.  They flew in-line with one another, like a traffic light, just straight up and down.  They just appeared, and followed, almost like a rainbow pattern and then vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The lights remained solid the entire time, they did not flicker and they did not make any sound.  I would approximate the distance to have been at a minimum of 3 miles away, and still they were very large.  A few moments later, another individual came out of her house and said she saw them as well.  After about 20 minutes of continued observation of the location the objects were spotted, they did not reappear.<n>
11/1/86 23:45|Martinsburg|WV|Oval|15 min.|bottom of a huge aircraft hovering directly over the yard.|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/051/S51684.html|9|ndxe198611| bottom of a huge aircraft hovering directly over the yard.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working night shift at the switchboard. I went outside on the porch, because I heard a humming, low, pulsating noise-like that heard in a transformer yard.I stepped ontp the porch and looking around, I didn&#39;t see anything. I went back inside, but continuing to hear the noise, again went out to investigate. This time I looked up. Whoa-WHAT IS THAT?I was huge! It was gray metallic, and was blocking the stars. It was about the size of 3 rancher style house,like the one I was in. It had ridges all along the bottom of it, and all I could see was the bottom of the craft. I am going to say it lookes like an aircraft carrier(navy) as far as its construction and size, and I could only see the bottom. A very thin light started to shine from the bottom of the craft, and I immediately became frigtened and went back inside. I heard the hum of the craft for another 10 sec. or so, and I assume when it took leave it created a power surge, which put out the lights briefly enough for me to have to reset the clocks.I have seen other things I felt unusual, but that one was the most dramatic thing I have ever seen. It was incredible!<n>

It steadily grew closer and to our surprise came within a couple hundred feet of us. Seemed to be watching us! Very creepy. Triangular craft with three white lights at each corner. Three pod like shapes underneath and metalic looking rigging arond all sides. Moved incredibly fast, silent, and in any direction it wanted to go. We were very scared when the craft seemed to descend upon us , so we got back in the car and took off ,craft followed us for about a mile before speeding off to the east.This was the most incredible thing i&#39;ve ever seen. Please, if any one has seen this please let us know. We were ridiculed until we just stpped talking about it. I just found this sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>
11/1/86 03:00|Stoke-on-Trent (UK/England)||Light|15 min|Whilst working as a security officer about 20 years ago, I saw something, that has left me without any doubts of the exsistance of ufo,|10/30/06|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52937.html|11|ndxe198611| Whilst working as a security officer about 20 years ago, I saw something, that has left me without any doubts of the exsistance of ufo,s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My story may not be as colourfull as some, but I saw it, and it is true ! My job entailed me to walk between two factory plants, throughout the night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One of the plants, is a secret place, that has been built in a small dip, out of site.This site is involved in the manufacture of some sort of catalyst, that is used for something in the nuclear IND.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyhow, one winter night while walking to the catalyst plant, I couldnt help but notice what a beutifull clear night it was, and how all the stars were out.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a 5 min walk, and approaching the crest of the hill that hides the plant, I saw a bright white light. I didnt think anything at all at first, as there is nothing unusual about seeing a white light in the sky at night, IE planes and helicopters ect. But, there was something different about this light and I couldnt figure what it was. I first spotted it when it was maybe, 3 miles away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The light was coming directly at me from a slight angle { 2 o,clock }.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Flying at a sort of horizon level to where I was standing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was something that intreiged me to stop walking when I reached the top of the crest.It was now getting very close. It was a white light of quite high intensity, yet it did not seem to project any sort of beam. I would estimate the light to have been approx 12&#34; in diameter. It travelled accross the sky at about an estimated guess of about 50 mph ground speed. As it aproached the plant it slowed right down and actualy stopped above the roof of the plant. I would guess this to be about 30 meters above. By this time I had actualy walked about 20 meters down the other side of the crest, which put me approx 75 meters from the light source.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Because I was still someway up the crest still, I would guess this put the light source about 10 meters above me, and about 75 meters in front of me at about 1 o,clock. A number of things realy botherd me about what I was seeing ! First off, was the fact that there was no red or green lights, IE plane etc ! Second, I knew that this thing was very close, yet there was no noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was about 3am early morning, and you could have heard a pin drop from 20yrds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> By this time,Im thinking OK, what have we got that would explain what it is im looking at. Answer, Stealth helicopter. I dont know if such a thing exsists, but it has to be something that can fly slowly and hover and do it in total silence.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then realised, that because it was so close, and the sky was so clear, I should actually be able to see the craft, whatever it was ! I then realised that under close scruttiny, when I looked just above the light I could actually see a star ! This told me that the light must be on the upper part of the craft. So this gave me the idea of sorts of looking to the sides and below this light. I was in dissbelief when I found that I could actualy make out other objects like the trees on the oppossite side of the hill.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the realisation of the fact that this light that I had seen so far travel accross the sky and then to stop almost in throwing distance from me, actually had no body, actually made me a little nerv rattled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had actualy been watching this thing intentley for about 10 min or so by now, I wasnt 100% convinced that what I was looking at was a UFO at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was certainly wondering if this was the case and if that had been it I would probably never have known ! As I said, as it was winter, it was biteingly cold, and this eventualy won me over to get inside for a warm, leaving the strange light still hoverig above.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I took, maybe 3 steps towards it and it shot through the sky in the direction from which it came. There again, was no noise. There was also, seemingly no acceleration as such. It went from zero speed, to what I can only describe as comet type speed. It was gone in a streak of light in about two seconds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It reminded me of a comet I saw when walking home from school as a child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know we will always have secret technoliges ect but no way, have we gone that far ! I SAW A UFO. That is a fact ! No amount of crap about reflections ect from whoever could ever convince me in the slightist that I didnt see what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If only there wasnt so many idiots in this world, claiming allsorts where ufo,s are concerned, maybe we would know the truth about how many are seen and how often etc. This happened to me about 20 years ago, and I still think about that night quite regualry. This is the first time I have ever recorded this incident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seems strange even now addmiting this happened. I know now, that they exsist ! Yet I am still reluctant to beleive other peoples stories.<n> <n><n> <n><n>
