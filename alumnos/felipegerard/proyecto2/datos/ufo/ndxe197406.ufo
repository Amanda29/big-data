He had been working on his house for a few years, and was ready to break it in with a full-on jam.  We were told, by the owner, that he recently saw a strange light near the top of the mountain, in a small clearing near the top.  (There are no roads that anyone could drive to reach this location).  He also had seen a UFO at the base of the mountain, on the road that leads to his driveway, in a large pasture, maybe only 100 yards away, but didn’t like telling people about the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we drove up his mostly rocky driveway, and I saw a light where he had been telling us about.  We didn’t really say anything, just unloaded our equipment, set up, and began to play some music.  Maybe 30-40 minutes passed and the power went off in the whole house, right in the middle of a song. We froze and didn’t make a sound.  It was pitch dark in the room.  The owner scrambled and found a flashlight so we could see and set our instruments down, then he just yelled out, “we have to go now”!   I noticed he was holding a shotgun.  We starting running to the cars, but all of us jumped in one vehicle.  I was shoved in the back seat in the middle so I missed the fly-over.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now, this is the part where everyone was in survival mode and frantic at the same time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am usually the driver in all situations, because I like being in charge, but not this time.  The next memory I have is being back in Lynchburg, and getting dropped off at my parents house.  That’s it! No memory of the ride, nothing.  I have a great visual memory when it comes to driving.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event only lasted a few minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Recently, this year, 2012, I confronted two of my friends that were there, and the stories are a little different.  One friend that I still play music with, did see the fly-over, but not I.  One other person, the owner, remembers nothing now of the event but still remembers the other times he has seen lights on the mountain, and flying around the mountain making no sound.<n>
6/30/74 22:00|Minot|ND|Other|30 minutes|Translucent arch over road, small cloud that changed colors and sparkled.|1/10/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/067/S67809.html|2|ndxe197406| Translucent arch over road, small cloud that changed colors and sparkled.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting happened in the summer of 1974 a few miles south of Minot ND.  I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  It was a very clear night and I walked down the driveway from the house  so I could get a full view of the night sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came to the end of the driveway I noticed a white translucent arch over the dirt road  that ran in front of the house north and south.  I was puzzled by this and wondered if it was some kind of fog.  I walked  about 30 feet down the road to get a better look.  I could see that the arch went from one side of the road to the other side right down to the ditch.  I walked under it and looked up and could faintly see the stars through the arch while looking strait up into the sky.  I then would walk about three feet from under it and the stars where all bright and all the sky clear.  It reminded me of the milky way.  I moved under it then  next to it a couple more times  then excited I ran to the house to get someone else to come see this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was about 10 pm as my parents where watching the news so I went to my brothers room who is 15 years old.  He thought I was crazy but I persuaded him to come out and look about 10 minutes later as he was in bed  watching TV and had to dress.  When we got to the area where I had seen the arch it was gone.  Down the road north about 60 Ft., we both witnessed a cloud above the road about 20 feet in diameter.  We started to follow it as it was moving away from us.  It was no longer a translucent white. It would turn red to blue, green and had like sparkling little lights shimmering in it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We both started to follow it till the road ended 200 ft. then it veered to the NW and we crossed over the barbwire fence climbing over a couple hills to follow it.  We stayed down when we came to the top of a hill as it almost seamed to be trying to lose us.  It stopped over the top of a large watering hole about 30 feet..  We could not follow it anymore but as we watched it for about one minute it was still changing colors and sparkling.  It then started to fade quickly.  We walked home amazed as we lived in the country, hunt, hike at night to a neighbors.  We never seen anything like it.  To this day we recalled this sighting and both seen this.  We had seen the same thing other than him not seeing the arch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not a drug user or drinker.  I am now 48 years old and still can picture this dense cloud type object that changed colors along with the arch over the road. We have never seen anything like this again, nor have met anyone else that seen anything like this before.  We figured it could have been something from the Minot Air Base.  We have seen fog over water and such.  The arch did not loose its shape fade.  I was thinking of walking down into the ditch to one side of the arch touching to the ground to see if I could walk through it or put my hand in it.  I decided that may be dangerous so ran back to get a witness.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would like to be contacted about sightings in the Fargo area.  When I googled to see if anyone else seen thease sightings your sight popped up with reports on the same date and same thing that still hangs around at times.  I would like to know how to report the observation properly or hear a explanation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

6/30/74 21:00|Kingston|MA|Disk|10 min|Saucer emits beams of light|1/31/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/079/S79553.html|3|ndxe197406| Saucer emits beams of light<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sometime in the summer of 1974, me and a childhood friend, we were both 12 years old at the time, were at the local baseball field at around 9:00 pm in Kingston, Ma.  This night was clear but dark, not much of a moon. I remember this because I had dared my friend to walk across to the playground as it was unlit and two baseball fields away and it was, a dark night.  The area is nestled in the woods surrounded by trees and sparsely populated.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we started walking we got about to the pitchers mound when the sky in front of us flashed red. The flash was not like a lingering flash; it was extremely quick and seemed to span the horizon. My friend said, &#34;Did you see that?&#34;  It was very strange, and the color was vivid. I remember at the time thinking I hope it’s not the nuclear power plant exploding; the plant is about 15 miles down the coast.   As we continued walking east, I noticed an object about 20’ on the horizon coming from our 11:00 position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father flies as a hobby as I do now and I had grown up around airplanes.  It had red, blue and green lights in a circular pattern that were spinning. It looked like nothing I had ever seen. As we watched, it came closer, to about our 9:00 position.  It seemed to be flying parallel to the railroad tracks when it suddenly stopped.  I knew it was not a helicopter because it made no sound and no aircraft looked like this.  At this time it began coming toward us, I would say around 10-15 mph maybe.  I could see it looked like two saucers facing each other with the lights spinning in between.  It seemed to have no color that I recall.  It was about 100 feet away from us when it again stopped and a beam of light hit the ground.  The beam had a sort of bright bluish tinge. The beam of light started to scan the ground, up back left and right. I told my friend not to move or it will see us.  The object was around 100 feet high or so, it was hard to tell and it could have been 20 to 40 feet in diameter.  The beam then went off and the object proceeded to move a! bout 50 feet to our right and did the same thing with the beam, again the beam went off.  Now the object moved closer, to just above our heads and again the light hit within 10 or 15 feet away and I heard my friend start to whimper.   The light came to a point so close that I felt I could touch it, then nothing the light was gone the object was gone with no sound. We never saw it leave although I was looking at the light on the ground moving around because I didn’t want it to see us so I never actually saw it vanish, but it was gone in a second.  We both ran to my house five minutes away and told my younger brother and mother what happened.  Naturally my brother wanted to go see so we went back.  The three of us walked down a steep hill, it’s a road about 200 yards to the ball field.  Once there we saw nothing then we only walked out maybe 25 feet and the beam landed right in front of us. We all ran, my brother got to the top of the hill first and I heard a car skidding down the road,! it nearly hit him as he ran across the street. My father, a policeman in our town drove me down in the police car. I later found out the police station had got a call from someone else who also saw it. We never saw any sign of it ever again.  My friend and I went down to the ball field many nights after that just hoping to see it again, but I can never forget what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This was not just some distant light in the sky, but an actual bi-convex craft, with an insignia on it, that came down and slowly (about 45 miles per hour), with multi-colored lights blinking in what appeared to be programmed sequences, literally cruised up the canyons of Manhattan in daylight for all to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was working at the time for Joe Papp&#39;s New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theatre.  I was helping to build and decorate sets for various productions.  We were doing &amp;quot;Pericles&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Merry Wives of Windsor&amp;quot; up in Central Park at the Delacorte Theatre there.  I believe it was toward the end of June or the beginning of July.  I wrote the exact dates down at the time, but I have been unable to find the paper with them on as this happened many years ago and I assume it has been lost or thrown out by accident.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was asked to take a load of costumes downtown that needed last minute alterations.  We loaded them into the Festival van and I drove out of the park and headed down Columbus Avenue which turns into Ninth Avenue farther down.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I headed downtown at about 6:30 pm, I noticed what appeared to be very bright lights of some sort, way downtown, perhaps in the 20s or 30s.  I thought it might be a large neon sign or something for a store opening or maybe a movie premiere of some sort.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I got to the 60s near Lincoln Center I could tell that the lights were moving and coming closer up the avenue.  As it got closer and closer, I couldn&#39;t believe what I was then able to see.  It was a craft of some kind, very high tech-looking, heading directly for me.  It was just above the tops of five-story buildings on the avenue and it spanned the width of the entire street  It was circular in shape, but tilted up slightly so it looked like an ellipse.  The convex bottom was glowing a bright, iridescent greenish-yellow, almost like neon, with a Saturn-like rectangular shaped circular band, around the circumference of the craft, of bright green, which had small multi-colored lights (red, yellow, blue, etc.) set in it.  The band protruded from the craft all the way around.  The lights were blinking in what appeared to be programmed sequences.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were two large, very bright, red, beacon-like lights (one on each side of the craft), oval in shape (horizontally), which extended from the green circular band.  They were flashing on and off somewhat slowly, almost like a pulse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept saying to myself, &amp;quot;What the hell is that?!!&amp;quot;  I just could not believe what I was actually seeing.  I don&#39;t remember feeling any fear, though, because it looked so beautiful and non-threatening.  And the blinking lights were moving in such pleasing patterns that they made me feel happy (perhaps that was their intended effect).  I had the distinct feeling that they (whoever &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; were) were having some fun and just saying, &amp;quot;Hi!&amp;quot;  There was an insignia on the bottom of the craft, on the curved part toward the front, not the exact middle of the bottom, which appeared to be recessed in the yellow made of thick black lines.  I believe it was composed of three symbols, almost like a logo.  I had never seen anything like them before.  They looked like a foreign alphabet or symbol system of some kind as the craft passed directly over me as I drove beneath it, nearing the Lincoln Tunnel, in the 50s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Many other people saw it.  I could see people standing on the sidewalks looking and staring up at it.  The sky was still light at that hour, so I could see it wasn&#39;t being held up by a helicopter or something like that.  This was certainly not a blimp or a balloon of some kind.  It looked solid and real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was still rush-hour and there was a lot of traffic trying to get out of the city through the tunnel, so I couldn&#39;t stop, and I also had only about an hour to get the costumes taken care of and get back up to the theatre in time for the opening.  I didn&#39;t think they would take it well if the show was late going up and the reason I gave was that I had seen a UFO on Ninth Avenue!  I figured that this incident would be all-over the news when I got home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later that evening, I rushed home thinking that this was big news and that they would probably even be pre-empting the regular shows to cover it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got home I flipped on the TV and channel surfed around the dial, but there was nothing out of the ordinary.  I remember thinking that was very strange and decided to wait for the 11:00 o&#39;clock news.  Again, at 11:00, there was only the usual local news, weather and sports.  Nothing about the UFO, not even a denial, anywhere.  I thought maybe they were trying to figure out how to deal with it and were delaying coverage.  So, I went to bed thinking I&#39;ll check the newspapers early in the morning because this has got to be front page headline stuff.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I awoke, I went down to the corner newsstand and checked the first few pages of several main newspapers -- there was nothing at all about it.  Unless there was a small blurb in the back pages, but I doubt it. This started to instill some fear and paranoia in me, because I then realized that the government could totally censor and block or kill a story.  And I always had believed we had a free press -- but after this I certainly didn&#39;t believe that anymore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A few days later I was eating lunch near the prop department down at the Public Theatre when a gal I knew who worked in the department came in.  She had almost straight, longish, light-blond, slightly reddish hair and freckles, and looked somewhat ethereal -- a very pretty gal.  I said to her, &amp;quot;You&#39;re not going to believe what I saw fly up Ninth Avenue the other evening.&amp;quot;  Her face went ashen and she blurted, &amp;quot;I know what you&#39;re talking about, I saw it, too!&amp;quot;  She said she had been shopping for props for &amp;quot;Wives&amp;quot; and had just come out of a store on West 57th Street between Eighth and Ninth, and that she and a couple of hundred other people saw it go by as it headed up the avenue.  We discussed it a bit, and she said she had seen exactly the same craft as I had seen.  I asked her if there was anything in the newspapers about it, but she said, no, she didn&#39;t see anything.  And then she started to get a bit freaked-out and said, &amp;quot;I can&#39;t talk a! bout this anymore.  I don&#39;t want to talk about it.  I won&#39;t talk about it.  I don&#39;t want to continue this discussion.&amp;quot;  She then abruptly rushed out of the room in a somewhat agitated state.  Probably because the reality of it, and what it implied, had just really sunk in. I can&#39;t remember her name now, but I think it was Jane something -- but I can&#39;t say for sure.  I intend, at some point, to check with the Festival for a list of people that worked in props that summer and see if I can locate her.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I now believe beyond any doubt whatsoever that UFOs are real.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know that they&#39;re here, because I&#39;ve seen them up-close -- and I know what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I heard a loud ringing noise.  Everybody heard it.  The sound was like when the TV stations used to go off the air and show the colored bar symbol, or the Indian Chief.  I looked up, and alomost diredctly overhead, perhaps a mile high, was this white spehere with 3 points on it - north, east and west.  This is exactaly how it appeared to me.  Picture a circle with three triangular points.  It looked like Sputnik, only it was hovering in the air for all to see, amd it moved very slowly across the sky, making this constant humming/ring.  It was a high pitched sound.  The sound was constant, no other tone sounds, no pulse to it, no rythm.  I walked up to the vice principal of the school and asked him, &#34;What is that thing?&#34;   He looking at it too... He said &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;.  After several minutes it just moved out of sight.  It was hard to tell if it was changing altitude, moving higher.  Somtime later, in class, we heard the ringing sound again.   We did not go outside to investigate, and the sound did not last very long.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

The object appeared above the screen of the Theater and set there like they were maybe just checking it out. It was round and smaller at the bottom with a red light on it. The center revolved and had a number of windows in it with light coming through the windows. like standing outside a house at night and looking in but seeing nothing but the light. As the center revolved on one side was several smaller windows and on the other side was longer windows, There was no noise coming from the thing. My daughter started crying wondering if it was the end of the world.It hovered for awhile and then just took off real fast. It was gone a few minutes then reappeared, it didn&#39;t stay long the second time, it hovered a few minutes then shot off in the very same diection that it had gone the first time. I asked the people in the car next to me if they were seeing what I was and the man said he didn&#39;t have any idea what we were all seein. We left the theater right after that along with most of the other cars. I went to my sisters and called the City Police dept. they said they had  numerous reports. The next day I called the police back to see if they had anymore info on it, and they told me they had not received any repoets the night before. I cannot tell you forsure the time or the year for sure I do know it was in the summer time and between the years between 1972 and 1977. Because I know where we were living in this paticular house between those years and we were living there when we saw it.My daughter has passeed away but she remembered it quit accurately untill that time.

The radio was on and there had been several calls reporting ufo sightings to the radio, in the distance approximantly 5 miles away you could see an object with lights going around the edge, I watched it and as it was traveling across and not directly toward us I ran down the street to intercept it as I got to the corner it was directly above me, hovered,  I was the distance of a telephone pole above my head, it made no noise, lights of all different colors flashed around it, then I blinked and it was like a mile away, still no sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This was a long time ago, and this is the best I can remember, I never forgot it, I was right under the thing.  It was about cars with across, saucer shaped , and beautiful colored lights.<n>

I was an airman stationed at Loring airforce base.  The night of the first sighting there was a lot of chatter about a ufo seen over the flight line.  From where I was posted I could see nothing but most of the other post reported a ufo over the tower.  I was friends with the sargent who kept the blotter for that night and he reported the sightings in the blotter.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I came off duty that night K-9 was just getting to headquaters.  They reported that on the way back from the weapons storage area their dogs went crazy they stopped their truck and followed their dogs into the forrest.  They found a large circular area where the brush was crushed down. All of this went into the blotter.  The next day when we went to work we were told nothing had happened and 2nd Air Force had the blotter destroyed and my friend was told to make up a new one minus the ufo reports.  Soon after I was sent to Texas for further ! training.  When I got back to Loring the people there told me that while I was gone there had been many sightings.  It was so bad the helicopters where bought in to chase the ufos and the security forces had been issued M60 machine guns with orders to only fire in self defense.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Within 200 feet of both.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It’s been on my mind lately, in 1974 I was near the Palisades Power Plant in Covert Michigan while it was being built if I remember right. Anyway I was on apart of US 31 which had been cut off because of the building of the power plant, watching the sky as I usually did back then. I was sitting on the side of the road facing south. As I watched to the east, south and west I saw a large saucer shaped craft probably 80 to 95 feet in diameter rise up out of the swampy area to my left and a bit behind me. What has always bothered me is  that there was a smaller saucer shaped craft docked on the side of the large one. Both craft were a gray metallic color but had no lights of any kind. There was absolutely no sound, I sat watching it rise up to about tree top height and then it stopped  and hovered. I was about 200 feet away from the crafts, it just hovered there for about a minute as I studied it. Well it was not moving so I decided I  would. I turned my Datsun pick up around moving back to the North, drove under the crafts. I know they were real because I saw them in my mirror and saw the crafts move across the road to the west as I drove away. Like I said the one docked on the side really bothers me, I have never heard of a UFO with one docked on the side of it. Have You? I was not abducted I know that for sure, I went immediately to a near by friends house. Had him grab his camera and go with me up into the hills between US 31 and Lake Michigan. As we neared the area just north of the power plant where a boy scout camp was located we saw the out line of the craft through the tree canopy above. We could not get any kind of a picture because of the tree cover. It continued westerly out over Lake Michigan. By the time we reached the bluffs above the lake the craft was out of sight. Also my pick up started to run very rough, missing and spitting . I returned my friend back to his home and I continued back to my home, barely making it. The next morning my truck refused to start, it would turn ! over but not start. I had just tuned it up days earlier and found the new points and spark plugs burned away as if they had many thousands of miles on them.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

While growing up, two siblings and myself shared a bedroom. I&#39;m not exactly sure of the year, but I know my older sister was married and my other sister was married in 1973. I finally had my own bedroom. My brother was still @ home and sleeping. Mom and Dad of course were sleeping in their room. I would have been 20 years old @ the time. A bedroom window was over my bed. To the north of the house was a Maple tree which was outside my bedroom window. Early morning. Still dark outside. Clear sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was awoken by a very loud sound, that sounded like a low airplane. I wanted to see what the sound was so I got up on my knees and looked outside the window. What I saw has stayed with me for 33 years. Just above the tree-top was a disc shaped object that had colored lights at it&#39;s base. The lights seemed to have a pattern of rhythm changing in and out or maybe rotating.  It slowly moved just above the tree top heading north. I cannot remember a deafening loud noise at my window then, but a humm sound. It was summer. There was no motion of the leaves or tree limbs (like strong wind) when it passed over. I lost sight of it after it passed over the tree. I ran into the bathroom (which was the next room over)to look out that window (which faced the same direction) and it was gone. It&#39;s like it totally disappeared quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What&#39;s amazing to me is nobody else in the house was awoken by the LOUD noise. It&#39;s like I was the only one meant to see it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother, maybe 10 minutes later was up. I said to him, &#34;I just saw a UFO&#34;. His response was naturally...yea right!

We had been fishing and saw a light cross the sky from west to east. What made this light interesting was that it stopped about four times as it made an arc across the sky. That meant it wasn&#39;t a sattelite or a plane. It was very high up but it was a moonless night. We watched it for at least an hour. I remember it was a Sunday night. We usually traveled from our hunting camp back to Pittsburgh Sundays but we stayed this evening and left early Monday morning. As we were driving back we listened to KDKA and at six thirty a report came on that a Ufo had crashed in a lake in eastern Pa. We listened intently. The seven oclock radio news said that people had witnessed the Ufo crash but they nevr named the town or vicinity. Then at seven thirty the KDKA news said that the National Gurad and army had surrounded and closed the area. That was the last we ever heard of it! There was nothing in the newspaper. Our light in the sky had been traveling west to east.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

This night was clear but dark, not much of a moon. I remember this because I had dared my friend to walk across to the playground as it was unlit and two baseball fields away and it was, a dark night.  The area is nestled in the woods surrounded by trees and sparsely populated. As we started walking we got about to the pitchers mound when the sky in front of us flashed red. The flash was not like a lingering flash; it was extremely quick and seemed to span the horizon. My friend said” did you see that”.  It was very strange, and the color was vivid. I remember at the time thinking I hope it’s not the nuclear power plant exploding; the plant is about 15 miles down the coast.   As we continued walking east, I noticed an object about 20’ on the horizon coming from our 11:00 position.  My father fly’s as a hobby as I do know and I had grown up around airplanes.  It had red, blue and green lights in a circular pattern that were spinning. It looked like nothing I had ever seen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As we watched it came closer, it was at our 9:00 position; it seemed to be flying along the railroad tracks when it suddenly stopped.  I new it was not a helicopter because it made no sound and no aircraft looked like this. At this time it began coming toward us.  I would say around 10 mph maybe. I could see it looked like two saucers facing each other with the lights spinning in between. It seemed to have no color that I recall. It was about 100 feet away from us when it again stopped and a beam of light hit the ground.  The beam had a sort of bright bluish tinge. The beam of light started to scan the ground, up back left and right. I told my friend not to move or it will see us. The object was around 100 feet high or so, it was hard to tell. The beam then went off and the object proceeded to m! ove about 50 feet to our right and did the same thing with the! beam, a gain the beam went off. Now the object moved closer, to just above our heads and again the light hit within 10 or 15 feet away and I heard my friend start to whimper.  The light came to a point so close that I felt I could touch it, then nothing the light was gone the object was gone with no sound. We never saw it leave although I was looking at the light on the ground moving around because I didn’t want it to see us so I never actually saw it vanish, but it was gone in a second.  We both ran to my house five minutes away and told my younger brother and mother what happened.  Naturally my brother wanted to go see so we went back.  The three of us walked down a steep hill, it’s a road about 200 yards to the ball field.  Once there we saw nothing then we only walked out maybe 25 feet and the beam landed right in front of us. We all ran, my brother got to the top of the hill first and I heard a car skidding down the road, it nearly hit him as he ran across the street. My father! , a policeman in our town drove me down in the police car after he grabbed a German mp-40 machine gun to take with us.  I don’t know what he could do with that but I later found out the police station had got a call from someone else who also saw it. We never saw any sign of it ever again.  My friend and I went down to the ball field many nights after that just hoping to see it again, but I can never forget what I saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It flew toward us then hovered about 100 ft (I don&#39;t judge distance well but it was close) over us.  It was almost as if it was watching us or wanted us to see it.  Then it suddenly flew away in the opposite direction.  I can&#39;t remember because it was so long ago but it had lights inside that either dimmed when it hovered or dimmed when it flew away.  We were teenagers and I never told my parents as I thought they&#39;d think I was crazy, but one of the other witnesses told her mother.  Her mother said she&#39;d listened to a police scanner the night we saw it and heard a beach deputy come on the radio and state that he had also seen something.

I assume it was a real space ship since i&#39;m still a very young at that age ,after two months it appear the same again. and no more.

It was slightly below horizontal line of view. I could see its right side, some of its top , and some of its rear. It looked like the space shuttle, but much sleeker, no markings, no sign of seams or windows, or propulsion units from the rear. I was outside that dayand noticed a silence, unnatural, thats when I got on the building. I got down to get someone else, changed my mind and got back up on the building, about a minite, it was gone.

Please read my whole discription.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was driving on a new divided highway heading east at 13:00 hours. There was a large field on my right. I was going about 50 mph and eventualy got up to about 85 mph. I had a glair on my windshield. I think it was a reflection from the craft. When I looked for the origin of the reflection I saw a triangular shaped object about 1/4 mile or less to my right. It was gray in color with out any markings or windows. The craft was going a little faster than I was going and I speeded up to try to keep up with it. The craft moved towards me slightly and banking like an airplane would. That is when I saw that it did not have a vertical tail like an airplane. I followed it for about one mile when it flew over  the crest of a hill which was covered with mature trees. They were about 60 feet tall. The craft was only about 100 feet above the ground. When I got on the other side of the trees it was gone. I turned around and retraced where I had seen it and made sure about my bearings. When I got to my sisters house I told her about it and of coarse she thought that I was crazy. This happened on a Saturday and the following Friday on the local tv news they said that the radar at the Albany County airport recorded an object heading south from Saratoga Springs at over 4,000 mph and made a right angle turn towawds the east. They said that it happened a week before which is when I saw what I saw. They also said that there were about 40 sightings of ufo&#39;s that same day. They also said that it was not reported on the news until the airport could verify that there radar was working properly. It has been so many years that it could have happened in 1974 or 1975 or 1976, but I think it was 1974.

Everyone on the playground seen it. there were a multitude of twinkling lights way up in the sky. all silver. very small but yet visibly shining. there was also an airplane coming in from the southwest, it went behind a cloud and there was a loud explosion. I never saw the plane come back out of the cloud. nor did i see anything fall out of the sky. My principal got back to me and told me the airforce had checked out the lights.

I don&#39;t know what drew my attention upwards, but despite the fact that there were hundreds of other students around, no one else seemed to be looking up.  I saw what appeared to be a very large, trangular aircraft.  What interested me was the fact that it appeared to be flying at an extremely high altitude, yet nonetheless appeared extremely large.  It was all black and a perfect triangular shape.  While I didn&#39;t know this at the time, it looked just like the modern stealth B-52 bomber. I listened and could not hear a typical jet engine sound.  It was silent.  It was also moving very slowly.  I saw what appeared to be windows on the bottom of this craft though they could have been tiles.  I watched for about a minute until the bell rang and I had to go to class.  I questioned what I had seen and frankly was embarassed to tell anyone else about it because I thought that they would have made fun of me for certain.  It was all I could think about all day.  The strange part occurred when I got home from school that afternoon.  After I had convinced myself that all I saw was a plane and that my imagination had gotten the better of me, I spotted the Detroit Free Press.  On the front page was a black and white photograph of four or five triangle shaped lights taken by someone in Michigan the night before.  The headline proclaimed that these were unidentified flying objects.  This was too much to be a coincidence.  However, I remained reluctant to tell anyone what I saw becuase I was certain they would have thought I was making it all up.  It haunted me for some time.  However, upon the unveiling of the stealth B-52 Bomber, I realized that most likely what I had seen was a prototype of the stealth or the actual stealth before it was ultimately unveiled to the public.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was doing my paper route early one morning in the San Diego area.  La Mesa is where I was, this is adjacent to San Diego on the east side.  I wasn’t aware of it at the time of the sighting, but there were a rash of UFO sightings in the area for a week or two after this sighting. 	There are a couple of maps included that show the locations of these events.  The intersection of Highland Ave. and Carter Pl. is on the top of a hill.  From this vantage point you can see all the way to the coast and up past what was then known as Miramar Naval Air Station.  It is a Marine Corp. Base now.  I was familiar with the normal flight patterns of commercial aircraft on their approach to Lindbergh Field and military aircraft around Miramar. On this particular morning, and as long ago as this happened I can’t even begin to tell you what day (or year) it was, I had started my paper route a little earlier than usual.  It was still dark that morning.  As I looked to the NW I saw in the distance a triangular grouping of red lights.  They were not blinking, but burning steady.  They were banked at a slight angle because I could see all three lights.  I thought that this was unusual, but it appeared to be over the MNAS area so I didn’t pay too much mind to it.  The altitude may have been around 1000 ft.  The intersection I mentioned above is at the top of a hill, there are two short  roads that dead-end to the side of Lee Street.  I had one or two deliveries on each road.  After completing the delivery on the first road (elapsed time may have been 1 min.) I returned to the intersection and glanced out towards the NW again.  This time I saw the same triangular pattern of red lights at the same angle but this time they were closer.  Still not blinking, just steady.  By now I was getting curious so I looked at them for a few seconds.  They didn’t seem to be moving much.  I went down the second road and delivered the other one or two papers and returned to the intersection to look at the object.  Elapsed time was again around a minute.  Now it was gone.  I sat there for a while looking around to see where it could have gone.  From this location I had a good view of the horizon and if this had been a plane on approach to Lindbergh Field I would have seen it for several minutes.  It was at this time that I realized that if this object had been a plane I either should have seen it on approach, or I should have heard it as it traveled behind me to the east.  My line of sight to the east was obstructed by the hill but I had a good view to the North, West and South. There were several reports of UFO sightings in the news after I had this sighting and it was at this time that I decided that this must have been a UFO as well.  I don’t recall all of the details, but one of the most credible sightings during this period was by an older lady who reported seeing a UFO land somewhere in the vicinity her home.  Investigators tested the depressions where the object supposedly landed and they calculated a significant weight had been placed there.  They ruled out a hoax because of the location of the landing sight and the difficulty of placing that much weight in that location.  The weight was somewhere in the several ton range if my memory serves me correctly. That’s the end of that.  If anybody recalls anything like this happening I would like to hear from you.

Before pulling into the driveway, I turned off my car lights, and drove slowly in on the side of the house and parked my car--and went in without turning on any lights.  I was hoping to just get inside and into bed without waking either of my parents or my two younger brothers or two younger sisters, and say to Mom and Dad in the morning, &#34;It was late; I didn&#39;t want to wake you.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should say here that we lived on a ranch eight miles northwest of Rexburg; our house is on a beautiful bend of the Snake River, surrounded by forest and our alfalfa and grain fields. The house is a split-level.  My room was on the second level facing south; the window looked out over the forest and river south of us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got to my room and was getting undressed--when I saw a white light above the trees to the southwest.  No one lived south or southwest of us.  I knew that that stationary light could not be, for instance, someone&#39;s yard light.  I got my binoculars out and looked at that light--and saw a silvery disc with lights around the center.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran at once and got my parents up and the whole family ended up following.  All seven of us stood there and watched it through my window for some time, taking turns with the binoculars.  I wanted to call the police and the neighbors and tell them to go out and look at this, but my father forbade me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually, everyone went back to bed but my mother and me.  I wanted to try taking pictures, but we had no film in the family camera.  The disc would slowly rise up higher, then higher, then gradually sink back down and hover over the trees. it did this again and again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Mother and I watched it do this for about an hour--when a second disc came and hovered close to it.  The second disc remained there 20 minutes or so.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All at once, it took off straight up, and very quickly we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.  The first disc followed it slow ly, slowly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Eventually dawn came. Mother and I went outside and watched that first disc--now in the morning light--as it climbed up higher and higher till we couldn&#39;t see it, even with the binoculars.  (Mom cooked breakfast about 9:00 a.m. -- late for a farm family.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly she looked up at me and said, &#34;What time did you get home last night?&#34;  I told and that I had been trying to sneak into the house without waking them.  She laughed, and I didn&#39;t get into trouble.)<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/10/74 14:30|Merkel|TX|Disk|5 minutes|Very high daylight disc moving south to north, with no deviation of course or altitude or speed.|12/20/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15435.html|42|ndxe197406| Very high daylight disc moving south to north, with no deviation of course or altitude or speed.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Visiting potential inlaws (year before marriage)in rural area a very few miles south of Merkel, near Abilene, TX.  After lunch, while family members visited in ranch house, I went checking promising areas along small stream for archeological remains.  Found site with surface artifacts a few hundred yards north and a bit west of house, which itself had surficial artifacts due north.  Site was across road from area north of house, perhaps 300 yards.  After about 30 minutes of exploring, I looked up and saw disc-shaped object almost directly overhead, a little north and east of me.  Note here that surveying surface sites requires intense scrutiny of the ground, and therefore occasional reorientation of the head and neck in order to avoid muscle pain.  I had looked up several times while changing orientation, but sometimes looked east, or west, or NE, etc.  This time it was due north.  Object was moving due north, not especially fast but easily at same speed as a commercial jet.  Shape was perfectly circular, with no visible evidence of thickness --looked to me as if it were an extremely thin disc.  It moved due north at regular speed with no variation at all.  Neve rmoved from course.  Color silver-gray, as if brushed aluminum.  Not shiny or reflective -- gray on bottom, which was obviously in shadow.  No glow, no lights, no features of any kind.  As object continued north, it grew more &#34;oblong,&#34; that is, its N-S dimension shrank in relation to its E-W dimension, which did change.  It looked like a dime held at arm&#39;s length, but somewhat smaller.  As it went north, it got smaller in both directions, but it never gave any indication of thickness and did, indeed, seem rather thin in relation to its width.  Also did not change color or shade, but did seem to get somewhat darker as it went north.  Object disappeared into some high, fine clouds at a point very far north of me.  Estiamte of speed -- 600 to 1000 mph.  Sound -- none.  Lights -- none.  Colors other than gray -- none.  Movement to sides -- none.  C! hange in altitude -- none.  Change in direction -- none.  Decorations or discernible features: none.  Protuberances -- none.  Shape -- perfectly circular but thin, not spherical.  Upper superstructure -- possible, just not visible.  Lower shape -- unknown; looked flat but could have been either concave or convex; if so, not by much.  Duration of sighting -- about 3 minutes maximum, probably a minute less.  I recall removing my eyes long enough to light a cigarette, look around to see if anyone else was in sight, and returnig my gaze until it disappeared.   No one else around.  Sky -- clear except for very high, very thin, very fine, long feather-shaped clouds in parallel orderly arrangements that some people now seem to think represent &#34;chemtrails&#34; or other manipulation of the weather.  Back then, we recognized these cloud features as being normal for summer or late spring.  Object was above these clouds, which according to qualified resources not given to paranoia usually appear in the 30,000 - 36,000 feet elevations.  That means object was higher than 36000 feet and therefore was pretty damned big.  Speed may well have been in excess of 1500 mph.  No other objects in sky.  Nearby to NE was an AFB with a SAC detachment.  No planes scrambled.  Note that the object was perfectly clearly limned or delineated -- edges crisply defined.  No wings, no fuselage, no engines, no cockpit, no rudder, no tail, and no question about any of it.  No contrails.<n>
6/8/74 05:00|Tulsa|OK|Unknown|25 minutes|((HOAX???))  Wedding Cake Ship Sound was heard.|10/8/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58855.html|43|ndxe197406| Wedding Cake Ship Sound was heard<n> <n><n> <n><n> 51st and Memorial Drive, South West corner behind what would someday be Skaggs/Albertsons but at the time was an open undeveloped field boarding my neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was very early in the morning, approximately 5AM.  I was awakened by a female presence from my bedroom and I had this desire to get my bicycle out of my parents garage and go riding.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sun wouldn&#39;t be up for another hour.   It was the summer.  It was in the 70&#39;s, within a month or two of the June 8th, 1974 Tornadoes which destroyed Tulsa, Oklahoma, my home town.  I was outside riding my bicycle in my neighborhood, just 300 yards from my house.  The sun was just coming up.  There was this very unusual popcorn shrimp like cloud formations in the sky.   Just thousands of clouds which were white and puffy alto cumulus like clouds which were spaced out widely in the shape of curled up popcorn shrimp.   The local media weather personality on Channel 8, Don Woods, commented on how rare this day was because Tulsa had never had this kind of weather clouds before in it&#39;s recorded history.  I am to believe that this incident may have been just before June 8th, before the T.V. stations were knocked down by the tornadoes.  I have searched and searched for the exact name of these clouds and their exact date and history has buried it.  I can&#39;t find it.  Anyway, I&#39;m riding my bike on dark streets back and forth, back and forth, until the sun rises for one hour when I see these clouds.   Their startling clouds.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I can barely find information on the June 8th 1974 triple twister storm which almost took my life and my family&#39;s life and left us in ruin for the balance of the year of 1974.  It was truly an awful time with not running water, no gas, no electricity, no phone and no T.V.   All we had was KRMG AM radio to inform the community for quite a while.   AM radios and batteries and lots of kerosene burning Coleman products to make light and cook our food.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I rode my bike, the sun came over the horizon and you could see all these very strange shaped clouds.   And there were no cars running nor jet aircraft landing.  It was as if Tulsa was frozen.<n> <n><n> <n><n> No noise outside at all, not even birds.  And I heard this one noise growing and growing as if it was coming from an aircraft or something up in the air and I began to point my eyes to the direction of this very unique, unearthly noise.  I would hear where it was coming from and move my eyes to the noise as it moved through the skies above me yet I saw nothing.  It flew right over me I would guess at the altitude of a landing jet aircraft and proceeded off to the east.   I kept peddling my bike eastward following the sound and looking up and continued to see nothing as the sound faded away.  This whole encounter did not take just 3 minutes, it was like 25 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It moved as slowly as a Goodyear blimp from the sound as the sound moved in the skies as my ears could track that sound yet I saw nothing and it didn&#39;t wake anybody up in the neighborhood.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When the sound finally disappeared in the east, I was standing on the ground straddling my bike.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not 5 minutes passed and the entire neighborhood woke up and came to life.   People went out to get their paper, started mowing lawns, dogs started barking, tire sounds of cars were heard on Memorial drive, all the noise of life returned as if somebody just threw a switch.  It was really weird as a 13 year old I actually recognized this and knew major things were wrong here.....<n> <n><n> <n><n> And for some reason, I forgot about this sound.  I just shelved it in my mind and never ever thought about it again.  I never spoke with anybody about it.  Never made it a bid deal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also had at the time dreams of being a bird and being able to fly in my own back yard.  I used to dream somebody taught me to flap my wings and I would actually fly around up to 1000 feet high.   And this female person would talk to me then and was like my foster mother if you will.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was encouraged to fly and remember topping the chimney on my parents house and actually flying just above the cloud cover of the town and hovering there for hours at night.  It was always at night.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was a female but I never could remember her face.   But she took a liking to me as a child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And then I never heard anything more from her again.   This whole thing probably spanned just 4 months as I remember.   But I shelved the entire thing and never told anybody.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also remembered looking into the neighborhood houses for open windows of known Rock and Roll stereo freaks who might have a stereo playing but all windows were shut that I could see and besides, the sound was from above me and slightly to the south heading west to east in direction as it moved.  It also wasn&#39;t the kind of sound which was played back from a recording with hiss or scratch sounds like a record does, it was the REAL THING SOUND.  It had the decibels of a powerful engine or something like that.   There was no stereo which could make a noise that loud which was obviously far up in the air somewhere up there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It also gave me the feeling that somebody was looking down on me, the one kid outside with the bicycle chasing this sound and not being able to catch it and I felt this terrible, awful sorrow coming from somewhere as if a family member was either just abandoned or died or perhaps the feeling you get when your best pet dog is killed in a violent way.  A very sorrowful, sad feeling which actually made tears come to my eyes finally as the sound finally went away to the east and was never heard from again.  I had the feeling that I was just abandoned like a mom would say goodbye to here child for the last time never to see him ever again.   There was a sense of concern and fear and I remembered now, at the time I was led to believe I was going to have a very hard and challenging life.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was 13 years of age at this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Lost in space had been on T.V. and the sound of that spaceship in that T.V. series was Erie but not similar to this sound.   This sound was not man made it was real.  And so I grew up, and time just buried all of this.  I never heard this sound again and forgot about all this until recently.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m 46 years old now.  I&#39;m driving across country and the AM radio is on.   Coast to Coast AM is playing and George Noory.  He&#39;s interviewing Michael Horn.   Michael Horn is supposed to be the U.S. press representative of Billy Meier from Switzerland.  And I listened to this interview they did and somewhere in the middle of it they played the wedding cake ship sound.  I said to myself as soon as 10 seconds of this sound was played that I&#39;ve heard this before somewhere??? And I began to ask myself which T.V. show or Movie did I hear this sound on before so I could know where these guy&#39;s ripped this sound off from.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I eventually went to the website and downloaded this sound and played it a few times and it all started coming back to me.  I was asking same question back in 1974.  I remembered that morning.  I remembered the weird bicycle ride I took that summer morning.  Asking the question is this sound was coming from a neighbors house, what T.V. show or movie  did they get it from.  Yet I knew it wasn&#39;t coming from a neighbors house or some passing car&#39;s 8 track.   This is 1974 you see, not even the cassette tape was popular then.  Microwave ovens and cable T.V. were years off.  Color T.V. was just getting popular.  FM stereo existed but not widely used in cars yet.  Cars still typically had noisy AM radio with 8 track players bolted on.    We didn&#39;t even have synthesizers in that era to manufacture a noise like this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I heard this damn noise.  I felt those feelings.  I had those dreams in my sleep of flying with my other mom.  I felt some love from this person.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I have some post comments to make to this female person, whoever it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After having done some years research on Billy Meier and the Pleiadians and finding out that these people frequent all of our media and are somewhat experts on Human current events.<n> <n><n> <n><n> If what I have read and felt are indeed true, then I&#39;m dealing with an emotional being who&#39;s not learned to separate herself from her science projects....    And I&#39;m sorry you never had a child.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And while it&#39;s sad that you people actually read the contact reports from this very website, maybe you&#39;ll read this one and remember what you did back in 74.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I know it was you and I shake my head and ask the question if you leave that much concern in a 13 year old childs mind how are your possibly going to help mankind?  It was the certain knowledge and admission that this sound was the Wedding Cake Ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That the Wedding Cake ship was commissioned at around this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> And I&#39;m left with the question, why Tulsa, Oklahoma?  Was it the knowledge we were about to be greased by a large group of Tornadoes?   Was there something special about me? All I&#39;m personally left with is she decided to adopt me as her son for a few months and perhaps study me, I guess...  I dunno....<n> <n><n> <n><n> But I did hear that Wedding Cake ship sound on that popcorn shrimp cloud day which we have never had again, ever....<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

There was two other persons there that saw it. One is no longer with us due to his death. It happened in 1974 when I was in high school. We never told anyone because we could not believe it and did not think anyone else would. I have wondered about it since. After we watched it hover there, all of the sudden it took off over the horizon. But we thought it went down a couple of blocks over in my neighborhood. So, we went on our bicycles to see where it landed. Then we realized that it had gone over the horizon and not in our neighborhood. It was an inexplainable experience. This is what happened and there is no doubt about it. It is what it is. It happened! I have not resolved it yet. I still wonder and don&#39;t know what it was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

We were between towns out in the country in the middle of nowhere when I noticed a light to my left in the middle of a field about 200 yards away and about 100 feet off the ground. I asked what is that over there and driver replied it&#39;s probably a radio tower. I looked back stareing thinking that that didnt sound right when all of a sudden it lit up very bright sort of silvery/white. I told driver and we immediatly pulled over and got out of the car. We were heading east and this object was coming from the north going south. It was traveling about 2-3 mph or as fast as you would normally walk. So were watching this approach straight at us still about 100 feet from the ground. As it was just about on us they &lt;3 witnesses besides myself&gt; were freaking out saying it wasnt a plane, a ballon, or anything they had ever seen they were getting scared. I was in awe I had a grin on my face from ear to ear I was loving every moment. It was about 100 feet in length and shaped like a pool/billiard rack &lt;smooth edged triangle&gt;. It had 2 headlights in the front which were very bright beams like floodlamps yet the beams seemed to discipate and didnt project very far for as bright as they were. By now &lt;3-4 min. later&gt; it was directly over head. It was so close I could have thrown a rock up and hit it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was silent no sound &lt;except 3 witnesses freaking&gt;I dont even remember hearing crickets which I thought was odd but maybe thats me. It was bright, glowing, and appeared like brushed illuminated alluminum it gave off its own light. It had 3 radical blinking lights on the back corners. Red, green, and blue radically flashing strobes with no pattern sort of hypnotic. It was so close I could see lines or seams on it&#39;s underbelly where it seemed to be put together. As it passed over about 50 yards lt went behind a treetop and stopped and turned off again. You could see this dark silloette sitting there parked waiting. I said &#34;all right! Let&#39;s go check it out!&#34; But they were scared ((badly)) and driving as well. They said &#34;let&#39;s get the hell out of here!&#34; and we left. I wanted to check it out for all there was. This might sound weird but when we were flying back home &lt;100 mph scared driver&gt; all they could say is &#34;is it following us&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we did get back home before we had said anything they asked us what took so long. It had apparently been several hours later which seemed only minutes. I was urinating dark green along with fowl gas for the next dayz. I don&#39;t care what you all think but thats the truth and thats the way it all happened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From that glorious night my whole life / perception has changed forever.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to obtain reports from the other witnesses.

6/6/74 20:30|Washington, D.C.|DC|Disk|two minutes|Roiling, red/orange disk traverses nation's capitol at supersonic speed, near White House...never reported (1974).|10/31/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32579.html|47|ndxe197406| Roiling, red/orange disk traverses nation&#39;s capitol at supersonic speed, near White House...never reported (1974).<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were on a third floor balcony of a building across the street from the Costa Rican embassy.  We first spotted the craft to the northwest, visible as what appeared to be a bright landing light of a jet liner down near/toward the Washington monument, slowly moving eastward.  This is when it first caught my attention, and I pointed it out to my friends, as it seemed oddly bright and large for an aircraft landing light.  It remained in this aspect for 15 - 20 seconds, when it suddenly seemed to veer into a south-east vector, with the apparence of coming toward us, passing slightly to the east of the White House.  At this point my friends and I became VERY interested, as what sort of aircraft would be permitted to operate so dramtically and closely to the presidential mansion?  The night was overcast, it was most likely a weeknight, possibly Thursday or Friday night.  As the object veered toward us, it began to cross the city at a very high rate of speed, faster than any fighter jet could traverse the city.  As it came closer and closer it presented a definite red/orange roiling disk, with no tail ot trail behind it, underneath the cloud deck.  Now we were very excited, and shocked, and some of us began to be terrified and a few &#34;hit the deck&#34;, thinking it might crash into us or crash into the low hills behind us.  As it passed east of us, somewhat overhead, it was presenting a pure disk (circular, perhaps it was spheroid).  I had the impression of a roaring sound, and yet, later, I realized that it had made no actual sound.  This was the most dramatic thing I&#39;ve ever seen in the nighttime sky before or since, and I was fortunate enough to have see the meteorite that later crashed in Pennsylvania in 1965 as it flamed blue-white across the sky, through our family&#39;s picture window in St. Clair Shores, Michigan.  This was SUCH a dramatic nighttime display that I couldn&#39;t WAIT to hear the official explanation the next day......but there was no report of it in the papers, and when I called the local police station, the officer handling the phone had not heard a thing about it.  The lack of reporting of this aerial phenomena was actually more bizarre, even terrifying than the phenomena itself, for how could such an astounding display, traversing the entire nation&#39;s capitol, not be noticed by others, and reported, or at least SPECULATED upon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event is approximate, although we will encourage the witness to try to determine the date more accurately.  We will request permission to put him in touch with Stan Gordon, well known UFO investigator near Pittsburgh, who has investigated the 1965 event, referred to as the Kecksburg Event, which occurred near Kecksburg, PA, on December 9, 1965.

6/6/74 14:00|Green Cove Springs|FL|Circle|1 hour|Ever seen an orb, and then the mother ship. I have. Then they gave me something.|7/3/13|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/098/S98605.html|48|ndxe197406| Ever seen an orb, and then the mother ship.  I have.  Then they gave me something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Summer 1974 at Knights Fish Camp at the mouth of Black Creek, on the St. Johns River in Florida.<n> <n><n> <n><n> An orb approximately 12 inches in diameter entered the building through the door that faced the east.  It was a faint orange and yellow in color and glowed.  It circled the room once and then stopped directly in front of me.  Three others were present,  Both the owner and his employee were standing behind the counter, and a customer/owners friend was seated on a stool.  I was standing near the door that the orb entered through and it hovered about chest high, not more than 15 inches in front of me.  I thought about reaching out and touching it for a moment but quickly got a sense that if I did I might get shocked or worse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The orb stayed stationary in front of me for about one minute, then circled the room again before departing through a window.  No one said a word, we all just looked at each other in bewilderment. I helped out at the fish camp after school and on weekends for free.  My payment was the ability to take out any of the rental boats when ever I wanted and the occasiona!  l free sandwich and drink. I asked the owner if it was alright if I took one of the boats out and he shook his head OK.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The fish camp had a small channel next to it where we kept the boats, so I climbed into one of them and left the channel.  The boat was a 12 foot Stump Knocker, with a 6 hp.  Evenrude engine.  At the end of the channel was the entrance to Black Creek.  Next to it was a wooden bridge that rotated open for passing sail boats, it took both train and car traffic.  I steered the boat under the bridge and after passing under it, there it was.  Off to my right was an aircraft hovering above the water.  It was beautiful, a perfectly shaped craft, silver with no visible windows.  But what I couldn&#39;t  understand was that it made no sound, and the fact that the water under it didn&#39;t move.  How could something that big suspend itself like that without an engine that should surly be roaring. And why wasn&#39;t there even a ripple on the water.  And no exhaust smoke.  It obviously couldn&#39;t be ours, so that meant that the orb came from it.  I assumed that the orb must have returned to it before I got there. Where else could it have gone.  This I just had to touch.  I figured that if I idled the boat up to it very carefully that I could touch it, I might even be able to board it.  They or it had to have come from some place a heck of a lot smarter than us, so they surely could teach me a lot.  But as I placed the engine in and out of gear to nudge myself closer, it backed away at the exact amount.  It matched my movements, it didn&#39;t want me any closer.  I left the engine in neutral and kept staring at it.  I asked myself why, but then figured that that&#39;s what they wanted and who was I to question them.  So I thought to myself if I couldn&#39;t touch or board the craft than what can you give me.  And I thought, if I could receive anything from you, than give me something that could help the world.  Make this a better place, and benefit everyone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I never got an answer, so sounds, no lights, no smoke, nothing.  Again I just continued to sit there and appreciate the beauty of this aircraft.  Suddenly I got the idea that I could possibly charge it, force my way to it and at least touch it.  But the engine just wasn&#39;t fast enough. As I put it in gear and started forward, it simply rose up about 20 foot.  Then it moved away from me and rounded the corner.  That&#39;s when I really got impressed, as it took off in a blur and then just disappeared.  It was as though it was able to constantly increase its speed without limit.  One moment its stationary, the next its going hundreds of miles per hour, then only a blur.  WOW.  Or at least I thought that I never got an answer.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Have you ever had a dream, how about having the same dream every night for Ten Years.  Some how they were able to give me the details of an engine, or is it more than that. Every night its details became more and more detailed.  Eventually It got to the point where I could assemble it in my head.  I figured that I had better put it down on paper before I forgot, or something happened to me.  So I did.  I continued to go over it in my head over and over again.  One part was similar to a helicopter, so I enlisted in the Army and began working on them.  I had to figure out how they could change direction without the main rotor changing its pitch.  That answer was easy, a few of our pilots were remote control helicopter nuts.  So I showed them the plans to what I wanted to build. They couldn&#39;t believe their eyes.  They wanted me to let them hold my design so they could show their commander.  That was fine, a while later they returned wanting me to give them my design. I told them that ! I would sell it to the army, but I wouldn&#39;t give it to them.  Maybe I should have, at least by now I could have a working model.  I went to college and told my physics teacher that I wanted to make an electromagnetic engine, and he told me it was impossible.  I asked why and he said that because there wasn&#39;t one in existence. That&#39;s no excuse for me, there isn&#39;t one yet, because no one has made it yet.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t have the dreams any more, but I still have the memories, and I have my design. I met a young man a few years back and he asked me if I had seen the ufo next to the bridge there in Green Cove Springs.  I suppose he was in a passing car that went over the bridge. I laughed and told him that if he saw it, then he saw the guy in the boat.  He said ya I saw that.  That&#39;s when I told him that I was the guy in the boat.  It&#39;s funny, when you have the money to build something you don&#39;t have the time, and now that I&#39;m retired and have the time, I don&#39;t have the money.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I keep hoping that maybe one day Ill put all the pieces together, slowly but surely I&#39;m gathering everything.  I just hope I don&#39;t die first.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Like I stated the engine works off of electromagnetism, no fuel, no fumes, no noise. It can be placed in anything.  Something as small as a power tool, or as large as an aircraft carrier.  It&#39;ll work on land, in the air, under water or even in space.  But what would happen to the power companies if every home powered itself.  Or the oil companies if we no longer needed fuel for our cars, trucks, jets, planes, or for the military. They spend what 6 Billion dollars a year in fuel alone.  Or was that ten years ago..<n> <n><n> <n><n> I guess that&#39;s really I hadn&#39;t built it yet, what happens to those who come up with ideas like that?  Those who put thousands out of business, or those who take the money out of rich peoples pockets.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))<n>

I was traveling east.  About 100 yards before my lane, I looked south to see if the lights were on at my home.  In the valley below and the hill following was a huge, very bright light which was lighting up the hill and the valley.  I tried to watch it to my lane and after turning to lighted direction, found nothing in the sky.  My thoughts have always been that it was a flare.  I couldn&#39;t watch long enough while driving to really give a better description.  The size seemed to be about that of the moon.  It&#39;s color was a blinding reddish orange.  It&#39;s range 1/2 mile, and altitude a few hundred feet. Very bright and stationary.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Many of us went up on the balcony and opened the windows, to the south of us was a large dark craft, guessing -- it was about 500 feet wide  tip to tip, front to back maybe a 100 feet, there were no lights on the craft, because of the darkness it was very hard to determine a discernable shape, all of a sudden on the tip&#39;s of the craft a light came on each tip, shot forward from the mother ship at incredible speed, acceration was as fast or faster than most rockets I have seen, when they reached us both scout ships (as I call them)made a knife edge 90 degree turn to the west and shot out of sight.  Approx 10 minutes later they came back to the mother ship from the north, still very fast, stopped suddenly on the tips of the mother ship, and the lights went out.  We watched the mother ship until it passed overhead, about 20 minutes in all.  Many of the workers punched out of work and follwed in their cars, but not me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>

Event 2) Datona Beach FL.  Flat hourglass shaped  black craft off the top floor of a high rise hotel.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While sitting on the beach in Madison CT I saw what appeared to be a shooting start.  10 minutes later I saw trees in the distance being luminated.  10 minutes after that a sphere approx. 3 feet in diameter and glowing with an egg shell color.  It slowly traced the shoreline over approx. 100 feet for several minutes.  It then shot inland at a very high speed with little more than a slight whoosh.  15 minutes later it returned to the same spot. After several minutes of shoreline tracing it seemed to lose control, traced out a 5 point star pattern, each leg being about 50 feet in length and crashed into the water about 50 feet off the shoreline where it broke open. Inside was what appeared to be a fiber optic &#34;looking&#34; cable bunch about 4 or 5 inches in diameter. Wall thickness appeared to be 1/4 to 1/2 inch, smooth inside and out. It floated on the water for about 10 minutes still glowing. After 10 minutes it slowly dimmed and sank. In the summer 1981 in Datona Beach I saw an object shaped like a fat flat hour glass on a disk.  It appeared black against the clouds and sat right outside the top floor of a high rise hotel.  10 or 15 seconds after I saw it, it made a made a very high speed assent into the clouds in a long lazy &#34;S&#34; shape. I would be interested in finding out if anyone else had seen either of these sightings. Thanks,((name deleted))<n>

It then in a blink of an eye shot straight across the sky and stopped. It then dropped straight down in a blink of an eye. From there it shot back across the sky and stopped directly under where it first stopped. It then shot straight up to complete a perfect rectangle. From that point is shot back out into outer space so fast that you could barely see the light trail from where it left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I would say this object was moving at the speed of light.

It hovered for approximately 5 minutes and the lights turned purple and reversed direction and the craft started to land just behind the first row of trees and when it touched the ground we all got back into our vehicle and got out of there.  We got out of the car in the first place because the saucer shaped craft followed us from above for several miles. Everything was black that night and no one was on the road either that could see what was going on except us. It may have been around 23:00 hrs that the incident occurred. My sister doesn&#39;t remember anything at all, but the rest of were scared. My mother said that the craft followed her on every turn and she couldn&#39;t shake it off at all, that is why we got out was because it wouldn&#39;t leave us alone. We very luckily escaped with our lives. The craft appeared to have some type of trouble or something because it sort of wobbled only slightly like it may have been in trouble but we weren&#39;t going to stick around to see what came out of it so we left without delay.

In the sky was a completly black bicycle horn shaped UFO.  It had a large round shape in the back with a cylinder in the middle and cone shape in front of that.  Out of the cone shaped front was shining a huge light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The UFO appeared to be about the size of a football field, or maybe a little bigger even.  It was moving extremely slowly and was hanging very low in the sky, much lower then normal aircraft.  We all stood there with our mouths open for easily 15 minutes watching in silence as it moved in slow increments across a very short distance.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Suddenly the &#34;front&#34; light went out and maybe two or three seconds later the now completely dark shape disintegrated like ashes.

What we had seen, etc.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The father went in and called the police who, after several phone calls told him that they had some report that some air force base was conducting test flights of some craft they had.

A farmer saw three circular UFOs leave his cropland with burned earth circles in his wheatfield as a testimony to their reality. No one questioned this as a hoax, because the circles were so large and precise, the earth so altered, and the farmer so unsophisticated and trusted by his neighbors.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This event was covered by the Whitewood Herald and the Esterhazy newspaper.

At first, taken back, but went out to check just in case it was a real UFO. There it was, in plain daylight, and it was longer than any building in New Orleans. It floated there above the Crescent City, and we watch it make skipping movements northward towards the Lake Pontchartrain, which is the largest man made lake in the world, about fifteen feet deep. This happened around the time that three small gray creatures adducted Charlie Hickson. We are just about 100 miles east of Pascagoula, Mississippi.  Local newsman even chased a UFO with a helicopter and shows footage. There was a wave of sightings going on around the area. I was seventeen at the time and my brother ((deleted)) was eight. Just a few years earlier when I attended ((deleted)) Military Academy in Gainesville Georgia, I felt compel to go off to the parade field at night.  Looking up at the stars and I pour out my heart, and asked God to let me communicate with the aliens.  I asked the aliens to please come and make a landing near my hometown, within a 100 miles.  I told others at school that a UFO was going to land near my hometown, and they would then know that I could communicate with space beings. To my surprise, sky people landed in Pascagoula, Mississippi, but I was disappointed to know that they did not look like us.  Perhaps they are the ancient keepers of the Garden of Eden; perhaps they are the working police force that God uses.<n>

The cloud stopped and from behind it a metalic appearing cylinrical shaped object moved rapidly southward.There were no sounds. I got off my motorcycle while this was happening and got my binoculars. I looked for the object but it had disappeared so I watched the cloud as it rose upward and out of site. This happened in an area where there were no telephone poles or homes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About five minutes went by while I stood there watching and the cloud reappeared and moved back toward nearly the same spot. I saw the object moving toward me from the south. It slowed as it seemed to enter or go behind the cloud. The cloud rose again until it disappeared. I immediately returned to Tuscan. I attempted to report this occurance to The AF base and to contact the radio stations. This was done by phone and I never heard another thing about it.

I have told this story for over the years and never knew who to go to until tonight after watching the Peter Jennings broadcast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend ((name deleted)) and I witnessed a UFO sighting in Colorado Springs, CO around noon in the summer of 1974.  His family lived a couple of houses down from mine on Northcrest Drive located on the bluffs near the foot of Pikes Peak.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I remember it was a crystal clear day without a cloud in the sky.  We were lying on our backs in ((name deleted)) front yard talking about things that eleven and twelve year old boys chat about and then he said to me look up into the sky.  I looked up but didn’t see anything.  Then he pointed up with his left arm and I followed his line of sight and saw eight round disks rotating in a circular motion directly above us.  We pondered what they could be and I specifically remember asking him if he thought they were angels.  We watched these objects rotate in an extremely tight motion above us for many minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There were a couple of unusual things that immediately caught my attention.  The first was that the eight objects were metallic (silver/whitish) in appearance, circular in shape and were flying and rotating in an extremely tight circular pattern.  We viewed the objects from underneath and I remember the movement seemed extremely unusual since we were used to seeing military aircraft since we lived so close to the Air Force Academy.  Besides both of our fathers worked for a government subcontractor who worked for NORAD and so we were very familiar with all types of military aircraft of that era.<n> <n><n> <n><n> What was most shocking is what happened next.  As I stated the eight objects were rotating in a circular motion and then they suddenly stopped moving.  The objects remained motionless without falling from the sky and all were perfectly separated from one another.  Then they suddenly accelerated at an astonishing speed from one another in exactly opposite directions.   I followed one of the objects as it flew over Pikes Peak and when it disappeared behind the mountain I looked back to where the rest were, they were all gone.  My Friend ((name deleted)) followed another one of the objects in different direction and was also amazed.  After witnessing the finally, only then did it occur to us that we did not see angels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I swear to God that what I witnessed is true and will continue to believe it until the day I die.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Some facts: Colorado Springs is about 5,000-6,000 feet above sea level.  Pikes Peak is about 14,100 feet above sea level.  The objects we witnessed must have been at least 8,000 - 9,000 feet above us since one of them cleared Pikes Peak<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

It was a Nice calm clear late evening night.  Somewhere about 10 PM I was sitting with my 1 year old daughter on the Porch of our motel at the fishing lodge there.  The motel was surrounded by pine trees some 70 feet in height and the road leading to the boat ramp was was right next to my cabin.<n> <n><n> <n><n> A very large object totally lit up as if one bright light I could see no form of the object, this object was likely 300 ft or so above the trees, it appeared to be fairly low.  It was round and probably 200 feet in diameter or more depending on its actual height.  I base this on the fact that it was much wider than the road leading to the boat ramp and that road was at least 40 feet wide adding in the total right of way opened for it.  The object went well over the tree lines that bordered this road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object made no noise whatsoever, it did not illuminate the ground either which I thought to be odd as any actual light that is near usually has an illuminating effect.  It was quite low as I previously mentioned and traveling what I thought to be about 20 miles per hour.  This allowed me to watch it for quite some time.  I never knew what it was but it was puzzling to say the least.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My second most notable was also in the 1970 era.  It was dark and I had arrived at a local eatery where I was to meet my brother and brother - in - law. I got out of my car and as I walked toward them, standing outside, I gazed up into the sky and thought I was seeing a falling star.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well it was really to slow and did not burn out quickly as most do.  Now this light was very high it seemed and appears to be maybe the size of a close star would be , you know maybe just smaller than a kitchen match head .  I continued wathing it move and then suddenly it appeared to stop. What was really odd when it stopped there were four more lights (orbs) identical to it.  The four objects appeared to be in the formation of a square, a box shape equal in dimension.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They only set still for maybe 15 seconds and then all four objects or lights moved at the same time with no alteration in the formation.  It was as if this moving light had docked with whatever the others were or docked to or joined in formation, but it did seem they operated as one unit.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen a few other things but these were the most memorable and the only ones I really had time to actually watch for a period of time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It appeared very large but as I drove towards town it never changed in size and I didn&#39;t seem to get any closer to it. It covered a large piece of the sky bigger than several football fields. There were several other cars on the road but I never heard anyone, including myself mention it. It wasn&#39;t in the newspapres or on TV. I didn&#39;t say anything about it for more than 20 years later. I did a lot of thinking about it and came to the conclusion that it may have been the reflection of a Satellite launch in California or possibly Cape Kennedy Florida.<n>

6/1/74 03:00|Ymuiden (Netherlands)||Light|app. 3 minutes|Purple light moving south to north  at least at 1300 miles per hour|4/28/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17172.html|69|ndxe197406| Purple light moving south to north  at least at 1300 miles per hour<n> <n><n> <n><n> Walking along the Northsea shore facing North, I looked back in southerly direction when a purple light caught my eye. It was a clear cloudless night, my field of vision either way would have been at least 40 miles in Southern and Nothern directions. The light travelled from South to North direction and moved over land paralel to the coastline. The light did not blink and took 3 minutes from first seeing it, to disappearing in Notherly direction. Depending on the distance from me, speed could not be determined. Yet if it had been moving overhead, it&#39;s speed would have been 80/3 = 23 miles per minute At first I thought it was a plane or a helicopter, but because there were no flashing lights, it must have been something else. I phoned a friend who at the time was the night editor for a large newspaper. When I stated: I have seen something strange, his immediate reaction  was: &#34;did you see purple lights in the sky ?&#34; Needless to say I was astonished and asked: have you had more reports on this? He said: &#34;dozens of reports, but you are the only one from the West side of the country, all the other reports came from the East side close to the German border. All these people had seen formations of up to 30 purple lights moving direct North. I am puzzled to this day. john bakker (now living in Australia)<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

6/1/74 02:00|Wilmington|NC|Triangle|3 minutes|Looks like a Star Wars ship,without the top, smooth, silent, no lights, large and low to the ground..|8/24/10|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/076/S76915.html|72|ndxe197406| Looks like a Star Wars ship,without the top, smooth, silent, no lights, large and low to the ground..<n> <n><n> <n><n> Old UFO report.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This sighting occurred in the early 1970&#39;s on River Road in Wilmington, NC around 2 am in the morning.  I am reporting it now because I am older and have heard of similar objects being seen on UFO tv reports.  So what the heck, I&#39;ll tell what I saw and maybe it will do some good.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in my convertible traveling north along River Road about 2 am.  It was a clear night and the stars where out, no fog or clouds.  Then a very large craft came over the trees, I was very scared and thought &#39;what if I&#39;m abducted&#39;.  I pulled my car over so as not to draw attention to myself.  It was massive, about the width and length of a football field.  The shape reminded me of one of those Star Wars big star ships like the one at the beginning of the 1st episode but it didn&#39;t have a large top area, it was smooth and triangular, at the end it had 3 very large round engines just like the Star Wars ship.   The color was identical to the sky, when it went over me it blacked out the stars but looked like a hole in the sky because of the color match.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was moving slowly, I&#39;d say not much more than 35 mph and just above the trees, about 120 feet (tree hight 80&#39; plus another 40&#39;).  It was dead silent, no noise at all and no lights, no windows that I could see,  As it pa! ssed, heading south, that&#39;s when I saw its features.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I watched until out of sight then got out of there.  I&#39;ve kept it to myself until recently and then joked I saw a UFO then woke up.  But, what the heck, if will do some good or maybe someone else will recognize the description.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wonder what they have been doing all these years.  Obviously not attacking.  As I see it, if you have the means to travel like they must, you have access to all the resources you would ever want so mental growth would be more of a priority than desires to acquire things.  Hope this helps.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was about 15 years old and was walking with a friend on Manitou Rd. just west of Route 9D at about midnight. We were walking with our backs to the highway and noticed the sky light up. We both turned around and saw an object in the sky, about 1000 ft. up and half a mile south of us. I saw a white, glowing disk that stood still and made no sound. After a second or two, the disk moved closer in our direction and covered a half mile almost instantly, stopping on a dime with still no sound. After another second or two, it veered off to the east, in the area of South Mountain Pass.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have been encouraged by books like Night Siege to think that sightings in the Hudson Valley have not been unusual.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a dark gray metalic color and no lights that I can recall.  It had large windows down the side to me it resembled the shape of an uncooked hotdog.  we watched it for approxamatley 5 or 6 minutes, untill it was to far off to see anymore.It never changed course and never changed altitude.<n>
