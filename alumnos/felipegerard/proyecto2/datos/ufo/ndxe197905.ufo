Then started to walk  in direction of Daytona Beach. I looked over my left shoulder and saw a large solid heavy  disc object at approx 2000 ft.alt. flying south about 9:30 o’clock.  My perceptions were  stunned by how clear and sharp I saw it and how I (knew) it was something else, not of  earth.  I thought that strongly. I had chance to check every perspective as two 727 aircraft  passed underneath going opposite directions, the disc flew steady almost directly  overhead and there was not a cloud in the sky.  Of course I was thinking everything  you can think, everything I ever thought about astronomy and physics having studied  those subjects.  The object continued across the sky for about one and a half minutes  then it started to descend  to the horizon.  Last sites were of a telephone wire that blocked  part, then the disk left view. (from the curvature of the earth).  It is the most amazing  thing I’ve ever seen. I think many other people must have witnessed it.  That night I  watched TV.  There were no reports of it.  Contact me if you find anyone else that  witnessed it.<n>
5/22/79 21:00|Baltic|SD|Triangle|25|Unidentified glowing orbs|2/14/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60506.html|2|ndxe197905| Unidentified glowing orbs<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a true account of what happened on date to the best of my recollection. A friend and I were in submarine school at the time. We were stationed at Submarine base Groton CT. The two of us were scared to death to say anything until now. He is not aware I have submitted this report, but I am confident he saw the same things as I did, as we talked about it both during the event and many times after.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The night began after eating chow at the hall. It was not dark yet, we left the base at appx 7:00 pm. Being on foot we walked the road along the river. We soon found a spot on some rocks not far from the base right on the river. We were enjoying good weather as it was clear and warm outside. Nothing appeared to be any differnt than any other night. The sun went down darkness fell upon us. We both had taken up spots on rocks not far apart, laying down relaxing looking up at the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It seemed as if it was in an instance three color changing orbs appeared in the sky in a triangle formation. These orbs moved back and forth across the river in formation. They moved with the speed of light going across the river. Doing this manuver, stopping on a dime, all the time maintaining thier formation. I am not sure if thier were three or this was just one object. The whole event duration was only twenty five minutes in length. In the time frame indicated ten differnt movements across the river appearing to be looking for something. The blink of an eye they were gone disappearing in the night sky again with the speed of light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were scared to death to talk about this or tell anyone. Fearing what might happen or people thinking we were just crazy. I know what power the goverment wields and how they deal with issues like this. Until now I never understood what they were looking for but now it is clear. The Submarine Base just down the road had in port subs. This now I am confident whatever weapons they contained was what they were looking for. News of any objects in the sky that night was not publicized nor did we ever hear of it. It has been many years but I still recall events on that night as it happened yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I think someone should know about this now. It was as real as I am writting this today. I have told the story never publically, only to select friends. The relevance of this event now seems to take on a differnt light. I hope this is of value to anyone reading it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>

I was on the way to an overnight camp in|6/3/03|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/029/S29002.html|5|ndxe197905| It was in the spring of 1979 (or 1978) one of the two years I attended UP at Bradford campus. I was on the way to an overnight camp in the wilderness with my backpacking class in a car that included my instructor and a roommate. We had left Bradford and were driving along a road that was parallel to the state park we were planning to camp in, and I noticed that there were two small jets (military?) flying at about 5000 ft overhead (leaving small jet trails), and there was a small circular metallic object following closely behind the second jet. I told my car mates there was a UFO and they laughed, but my roommate then checked it out by looking up out the window and confirmed what I saw, and my instructor pulled over to see it. We got out and the object stopped following the jet and hovered above us at about a mile up (not moving for about 5 or 10 seconds) and then within about 1 or 2 seconds slid back to the tail of the second jet. It was far away but we agreed it looked metallic and seemed to be nearly circular but with many edges like a polygon with many (20? or 30?) sides (I seem to remember it reflected sunlight helping me to discern it had edges and was metallic). It left no jet trail and did appear to be able to hover and then accelerate quickly to a speed that was many times that of the jets it was following. They were headed I believe North into the state park which I remember was about 200 square miles of wilderness. That was the last we saw of them. I do remember after returning from the overnight hike, we read in the news that there had been many UFO sightings in NY north of the park at about the same time we saw ours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Then we n|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/003/S03421.html|6|ndxe197905| in the backyard. I looked up and saw what I thought was a falling star.  It came to a stop and hovered.  Then it moved again. Then we noticed approximately 12-15 of these objects ( which looked like stars) moving across the sky.  We watched them for about two hours.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was mid-may, 1979.  I was in the backyard with my family, and I looked up to the sky.  I saw what appeared to be a falling star (meteor or meteorite) but contrary to the typical behavior of falling stars, this one came to a stop, and hovered.  It looked just like a star.  Then, to my surprise, another &#34;point of light&#34; moved across the path of the first object.  Altogether, my family and I watched 12-15 of these objects move around in the sky for approximately 2 hours.  We called my Aunt, who lived a couple of miles away, and told her to go outside and watch them.  She went outside, but was unable to see anything other than the normal night sky.  We called the police non-emergency number, and they said it was probably fireworks or airplanes. Please note: These objects were extremely high  in altitude and made no noise.  There were too many of them for them to be satellites. Later that summer, my mother was describing the incident to an old family friend ( a lutheran minister)  who lived in WIsconsin.  He told my mother that on that night he had been fishing on a lake in Wisconsin, and he had seen THE EXACT SAME THING.<n>
5/15/79 20:00|Omaha|NE|Triangle|30 seconds|Silvery, triangular objects at low altitude.|7/23/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13471.html|7|ndxe197905| Silvery, triangular objects at low altitude<n> <n><n> <n><n> The event I am describing occured when I was 7 years old.  Although I was quite young, and the event occured over 20 years ago, what I saw is as vivid in my mind as if it occured yesterday.  I have shared this information with family and friends, but not with any &#34;official&#34; agency or group. My family had recently moved into a new home in a development in the suburbs.  The area was still fairly undeveloped, and so without the interference of city lights, the night time sky could often be quite spectacular.  For this reason, I had become quite fond of stargazing.  On one particular evening in the spring of 1979, my mother had left to make a shopping trip.  She promised my brother and me that if we were on our best behavior she would buy us a surprise.  Eagerly anticipating her return, my brother and I knelt on our couch staring out our large picture window while we waited for her. As was my habit at the time, I was gazing up at the sky through our window when I noticed a brightly lit object in the sky, appearing to be at a fairly low altitude, heading in the general direction of our house.  As the object came closer, I noticed that it was roughly triangular in shape, and had a &#34;silvery&#34; appearance.  It looked to be illuminated, that is, it was plain to see and fairly bright in the sky, but didn&#39;t appear to have any &#34;lights&#34; on its exterior surface.  Despite its relatively low altitude (about 1000 feet or so) it made no noise that I could hear.  I say this with some confidence because the object flew almost directly overhead. Almost immediately after the first object passed overhead, I noticed several more heading in the same direction.  Within maybe 15 seconds several objects, all similar in appearance to the one described previously, passed overhead following the same path as the first object.  The objects flew in what was basically a &#34;single file&#34; type flight pattern, with one directly following the other.  I was in awe, not sure of what I was seeing.  I didn&#39;t count the total number, but several passed overhead in approximately a 30 second period.  The objects came as quickly as they went, and my brother and I yelled for my father, who was in the other room.  When we explained what we&#39;d seen, he quickly dismissed it, telling us we&#39;d probably seen reflections of light in the sky or something else.  However, I remember the sky being clear that night so I doubt this could have simply been lights reflecting on clouds.  Moreover, as this was a new development, there were very few sources of light that could have caused this.  Furthermore, I know what I saw.  The objects where silver colored, and triangular in shape.  I have never since seen anything in the sky that I could discribe as similar.<n>

This incident happened on a Saturday about 2:30 pm in the day time. We were traveling on a two lane county road into Laurel, Mississippi.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I looked at a church on my left and saw an Oval shape object(like a basketball) but much bigger, with a dull grey color, hovering about 25 feet above the church.

And she replied,&#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;?<n> <n><n> <n><n> I then drove my car off the road and on to the church ground, to get a closer look at this object.

I observed these lights for 5 min then the lights stopped pulsating and the white light came back on and began to slowly move back to where it came from, I watched it move slowly back over the trees and disappear not to be seen again. the object was around 50-60 feet in diameter, and was not a helicopter,plane or ballon.<n>

It was right after dinner, the sun had been down for an hour or two.  Through the living room picture window, I noticed a bright light hovering--actually descending slowly at about  70 degrees until it reached the horizon.  It seemed to light up the ocean below it and it glowed intensely.  Then another bright light appeared in the same place high up in the night sky and began to slide toward the first one.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I called them to the attention of my family--who continued watching TV.  So I went outside, on the balcony, and was surprised at the brightness of the two lights (the picture windows had darkly tinted glass).  I looked at them and decided they were the perfect subject to test some new Kodacolor 400 ASA film I had just purchased.  I was into photography then and had a nice Minolta.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I shot between eight and ten exposures bracketting around a second each.  I am attaching two I recently scanned.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In a matter of half an hour there were five bright lights hovering over the horizon, as you can see in the top photograph. The little vertical lines under each light are the result of my moving the camera slightly during exposure.  The photo below, which may be the first one in the series, accurately reflects their &#34;shape&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My father, mother, brother, sister and brother-in-law came out to see them.  We all wondered what they could be.  Helicopters?  The night was silent but for the murmur of the rolling waves.  My brother-in-law went to the piano and played the five first notes of the &#34;Close Encounters&#34; theme by John Williams.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We saw the neighbors coming outside also and asked them what they thought the lights were. The lady said we should tune in the local TV news at eleven. &#34;They will have the answer,&#34; she said.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In about 45 minutes the lights went back up into the sky.  One at a time, but faster than they came down.  We want inside to watch the news but they were not mentioned.  So I called the NBC station and they didn&#39;t know anything about any lights.  They suggested I should call  Tyndall Airforce Base--which I did; but no one there had an explanation for whatever it was that we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The next morning I asked everyone if I had dreamt the thing about the lights.  No, I hadn&#39;t.  But nobody really wanted to talk about it.  I kept insisting.  My father said: &#34;We&#39;re near the Air Force Base.  They test things all the time.&#34;  For a while I showed the photos to friends and told the story.  Then they were put away.  I just came across them again and scanned those two when I went looking for family photos for a web page project.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;m sorry that the files are big, but if ever resolution mattered, it&#39;s in these cases,  no?  I also have the negatives which may contain more picture information.  Any one interested in this?  Any one knows what we saw?<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

My mother and I were driving from Hunt, TX into Kerrville, TX to buy something at the grocery store one night.  As soon as we came out of the tree-covered road from our house I spotted a gloriously beautiful, long, diamond-shaped craft right outside the car window.  It was on the other side of the treeline from the road, but clearly visible as it couldn&#39;t have been but a few feet from the road.  Instead of sharp angles, it resembled more like two cones with their bases put together.  It was maybe the size of a grain silo in diameter.  It was covered in lights, with seemingly no rhyme or reason to the layout.  The lights were different colors and flashed in a seeming non-pattern.  I turned to tell my mother to look out the window and noticed she was scared to death.  We were driving about 80 or so, as fast as she could get our car to go, and she was froggy.  Her reaction frightened me, and I asked her agian to look.  She told me to ignore it, there was nothing out there, stop looking at it.  Such an odd reply, so I ignored her and looked anyway.  This craft followed us into town, and just before we hit any traffic, it hovered for a few moments then almost winked out of existance.  There was no noise, no odd feelings, no &#34;sense&#34; of being watched.  It was just there, mere yards from us for miles.  My mother briefed me on not telling anyone anything, and that it was my imagination, but she was deathly afraid of something.  To this day she denies it.  We never told anyone.  However, about a week later my brother comes home from night fishing all breathless and excited.  He was about ten at the time.  His story went like this:  He was down on the low water crossing with a friend and they were packing up their fishing supplies.  He states the coolest thing happened next.  I huge craft appeared out of nowhere right above them on the low water crossing.  He described my sighting to the letter, and when he did I looked at my mother a! nd she w ent pale but looked at me to shut me up.  So I did. He then went to say that it hovered there, and he said there was no actual sound, but you could feel a faint buzzing in your body.  It then, he claimed, emitted a very bright, foggy, blue light onto him and his friend and he said it felt warm and tingly.  The best description for me to give you would be like a sonogram treatment after about 30 minutes of continuous treatment.  He said he still heard no sound, doesn&#39;t remember anything actually happeneing other than the tingly light.  Then all of a sudden the light was gone and the craft just vanished into thin air.  We have had a few episodes in Texas as children, together.  But to my knowledge I have seen no unusual craft in my adult life.  No one in the family will admit this now, but all three of us witnessed something interesting.  Just wondered how many other people have seen a similar craft as mine and where.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will request that the brother submit his report, as well.

We were going out for the night and walked out the front door to see a glowing yellow ball off in the distance just above the tree line.  It made no sound and it was moving slowly.  We got in our truck and drove out to the two-lane highway. On the highway we saw a light again off to the left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We pulled over to watch the light, which was now an orange color.  The area where the light was located is a large area of vacant land with an old barn. My boyfriend got out of the truck and I stayed inside looking out the window. We watched and it looked like it was at the level of a streetlight though we know there were no streetlights there.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It must have been a few minutes while it hovered and then all of a sudden it shot straight up in the air moving incredibly fast.  We watched it go up and then the glowing light expanded and then it was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When we got to the place we were headed, I called somebody related to air traffic/air force to ask them if there was anything they were flying.  They said no, but that it might have been a weather balloon.  It seemed like that might account for the floating glowing light we saw along the tree line but didn’t seem plausible for the way it stayed still and then shot up in the air.  I had never seen something move so fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
