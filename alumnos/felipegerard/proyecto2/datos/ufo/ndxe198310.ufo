Approximately 25-30 feet above my front yard was a diamond shaped, platinum silver disc like object about size of a school bus just hovering.  Different colors of lights lined the perimeter of the craft and were mostly shades of blues,lavender, yellows and greens.  It seemed to remain there for a long time which was probably only about 30 minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I turned to see variable glowing dayglow green disc following pulled up alongside (way too close to mistake for less than genuine) and did some flying stunts for about 5 min.  Way strange, made all my hairs stand on end literally.  Reappeared and threw extra bright light on car, flying in front of us same speed, only time it made any noise.  We both waved hi heartily at it at this time, me feeling a sense of inner peace that there could or must well be life elsewhere, having somewhat Saganistic &#34;skeptic&#34; belief before.  Light and noise from under craft diminished in intensity then took off like slingshot again.  We stopped in first rest area, after passing airbase I believe and French man was running around jabbering about a &#34;phenomena fantastique&#34;. Lady frind drew nice picture of it.  I think it put bright light so it could make movies maybe.  Have wondered if other sightings were reported same areas, times.  I think it was &#34;curious of us as we were of it&#34;. Have no idea what they have about cattle.  It was about 2.5 Lincoln continintal cars long, as I remember. Since then it seems way too many people/friends have ufo stories, including DeForrest Kelley and Jerry Garcia.  It &#34;floated&#34; noislessly while it played with us, noise grew when bottom opened and light started to grow too.  It flew close, like a lane and a half away on mostly deserted freeway due to strange weather patterns before they cleared and the time of night, saw maybe 3 trucks whole time until made rest stop.  Please email if additional data is needed, this is no joke.<n>
10/21/83 03:00|Upper Saddle River|NJ||2 minutes|Encounter with an alien being from 6 feet away.|7/11/14|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/111/S111342.html|4|ndxe198310| Encounter with an alien being from 6 feet away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My encounter with an alien occurred in the fall of 1983, late October or early November. I was 16 at the time. It was a clear night, chilly, mid 50s, no clouds or wind, with ample moonlight overhead, but not a full moon, about ¾ full.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend, who lived across the street from me came to my bedroom a little past 1 AM. He wanted me to walk to his girlfriend’s house a couple of miles away.  I wasn’t sleeping, so I agreed.  We spent some time at her house, less than an hour and begin walking back home.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were 4 blocks from our road walking up a road that comes to a T at the end, turning either left or right at the top.  We were about 50 or so feet from the T, walking on the left side of the road.  I had been walking looking mostly at the ground, my friend was maybe 6 feet in front of me.  As we approached the corner I looked up to the street sign the sits 3 or 4 feet on the corner property.  It was there I saw someone or something standing, not 2 feet from the street sign.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I began to slow my walk, not taking my eyes off of it.  My friends head, as best I could tell, didn’t raise up, I assume he hadn&#39;t seen it yet.  By the time we were 20 or so feet from it, its head turned right, from facing forward to facing us. My friend still gave no indication he saw it.  My friend was now about 10 feet ahead of me.  I noticed as my friend went around the corner, the head of whatever it was, was slowly turning to follow his motion around the corner, I was maybe 12 feet behind him watching this.  As my friend had finished the corner and began to straighten out, the aliens head was now completely facing left, towards my friend.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At that point it rotated back 180 degrees and was now looking at me.  I continued walking and as I was no more than 5 or 6 feet from it I looked at its face. It was maybe 5 feet tall, it looked a little bit taller do to the fact that the curb was maybe 4 inches tall and he was a couple of feet back from the curb and another couple of inches higher than the curb.  It was gray all over and lean, there was no discernible muscle tone, but very smooth.  Looking at its face, I saw there were indentations where the mouth, eyes and ears would be and a protuberance where the nose area would be.  The scary part was, those features were not there, only the spaces where they should be.  It didn’t look like a mask.  Its head rotated as I went around the corner following me, my head rotated to keep my eyes on it.  We were close enough so either of us could have lunged and grabbed the other.  It didn’t appear to have on a suit of any kind.  There were no visible buttons, zippers or anything that looked like it could get into a suit and fasten it, just smooth all over.  I did notice 2 arms but didn’t look at the hands, couldn’t say if they were human looking or not.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After I rounded the corner and my head was turned as far as it could go left, still watching it watching me, I turned forward and jumped and grabbed my friend arm, spinning him around and whisper yelling his name. I didn’t scream since it was nearly 3 AM. in a quiet neighborhood.  As I spun him around to face me I turned back to where it was standing, it was now gone.  He pulled away from me, agitated, and asked me what my problem was, but not that nicely.  I looked around the street sign looking for it, but it was gone.  Between that street sign at the end of the persons property and their house was nearly 100 feet.  I didn’t take more than 2-3 seconds after I looked away from it until I had grabbed my friend, spun and looked back to the spot.  There was nowhere closer than the house to hide. It would have had to move from facing the street to turning and running or moving close to 100 feet in less than 3 seconds.  And even then, there were only small shrubs by the house, nothing ! big enough to hide something that size.  Also, that night was very quiet, no wind, no cars, only the sound of our footsteps in the street. I would have hears something moving that fast, that far. There were no sounds aside from ours. My friend again asked what my problem was. I said nothing, thought I saw something. He apparently didn&#39;t see it or it was not visible to him. I never said anything about that night to him. Neither it nor I made physical contact with the other, and no time was lost during the encounter.<n>

Coming down the grapevine from LA we encountered pea soup fog but kept going slow because of drinking a lot of coffee, wanting to get to San Rafael on Thursday before Grateful Dead Halloween shows (Marin County civic center). Just about every other vehicle had pulled off because of dense fog.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We finally came out of the fog and I was remarking how the sky was so clear, stars bright like in the desert when Janis asked &#34;what are the weird colors off in the distance?&#34;.  I was just joking, playing with stereo and stated it was a flying saucer.  It looked like it had landed on little landing feet West, SW, some distance away in fields.  Well, I joked it was a UFO and maybe only less than a second later, as if it knew what we were discussing, ((female name deleted)) started going &#34;don&#39;t look now it&#39;s right behind us!!!!!&#34; it was following (pacing) just behind to the left of my car, then pulled right up alongside, (Janis going &#39;I TOLD YOU NOT TO LOOK!!), started doing every most outrageous seemingly impossible flying stunts you can imagine, including circular flips, just showing off all the stuff it could do, for over 5 minutes. It had a day-glow green color that emanated from it like fibers of light, more bright near what I assume was the metallic object.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was as close as a lane and a half, or 30 feet the whole time, just off the ground barely, so close it made all the hairs on my body stand straight out, like from static electricity. We were going &#34;oh, sh*t&#34; and stuff like that when it took off like a slingshot, disappearing in horizon to left of very straight road goes all the way north. Well, we were discussing it at length, saying I never imagined one like that could truly be until we saw it like 30 feet away. I think it was about the size of one and a half Lincoln continentals, round, saucer shaped, domed, we both think it may have had some portholes. We were wondering how on earth it could do somersaults and stuff like that, when it came back, a little more higher, flying (facing from underneath sort of) us from directly ahead for a minute or so, we were going &#34;whoa...&#34; again, when I think something came on or opened underneath it, only time it made any noise, and started the bright spotlight on my car, which had of a! ll things, a bumper sticker that said : &#34;STARSHIP&#34; on the front (for rock band Jefferson Starship). Well, it made a noise like a hatch opened, then the white light started, with a vzzzzzzzzzzz sound that got louder until it was as bright or brighter than sunlight, like a spotlight on my car, pacing ahead (little higher this time, yes) until it got to it&#39;s full brightness and loudness, by then going VVVVVAAZZZZZZZZZ, when I seized the opportunity to tell her to wave at it as a friendly gesture, as now it had given me a feeling of inner peace, knowing there must be life elsewhere, then it made a Kkuh sound, and the buzzing noise subsided at the same time the light dimmed, I think I heard a hatch close, then it repeated the taking off like a slingshot again, just to left of road, then took off in the horizon, a little more left (didn&#39;t need a road).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Well, we were feeling a bit too overcome to stop at the windmill truck stop as we came up on it, but called ok, time out, and pulled it off in the rest area just past windmill a ways. We were feeling a bit weirded-out, when some French guy I swear looked kike Marcelle Truffaut or something right out of the movie close encounters, just like the saucer, comes running up frantically waving his arms, hollering something about a &#34;phenomena fantastique!!!!!&#34;, just gave him a weird look, like, yeah, we saw something like that back there.  Yes, I think it was Thursday morn&#39; way early then, just before Halloween of &#39;83, so we kept going north, starting to feel a bit haggard.  Going back after visiting friends in Mendocino, we tried to tell where we first saw it, just past the fog, well south of the air base, and realized there was nothing there for maybe over a hundred miles or more except some cattle, they were making colored lights of all colors for some cattle??   Well, I shrugged it ! off as just an &#39;ornry cattle saucer&#39; but looked up much researching over the years to this day to see who else may have seen that saucer, far as I could tell, just her and I and this French guy maybe and maybe 2 or 3 trucks headed south maybe saw it zipping by, don&#39;t know.  ((female name deleted)), being a bit of an artist, drew a picture of it with the words &#34;genuine ufo&#34; underneath.  I didn&#39;t need to have made any photography anyways, as I have a DVD where it is called one of what are known as the &#34;Guardian Saucers&#34; in Vancouver, Canada, I think, where it had all the multi-colors from underneath, yeah, made my skin feel like it wanted crawl when I first saw the video, yeah, like it was just like something we saw, for real.  She won&#39;t discuss it anymore because she said she had some bad dreams about it.  Had some strange dreams myself, except more friendly, and peaceful, seeing all these drawings and video stories about grey extraterrestrials with enlarged heads and large black eyes that stare ! into a void or something.  Now I have a friend Susan, who tried! at firs t to keep changing the subject, but with my ongoing research, she&#39;s been saying &#34;Malcolm if I saw something like that I think I would be so SCARED&#34; to which I replied yeah?,  I guess if you think it would make you so scared it would, if you think it would make you have bad dreams it would, and yes, as in my case, if you think it would give you a feeling of inner peace, probably WOULD. I know, I had always studied astronomy since I was a youngster so interested in it my family bought me a telescope. I joined the San Francisco amateur astronomers, had always had a more Saganistic approach towards the subject, even though many friends had pointed out &#34;things in the distance&#34; or had even related their own encounters, just thought, sure, sure, bah. Now I wonder, what would Carl Sagan himself had thought if one of those came up and did a lot of aerial acrobatics from like 30 feet away, it&#39;s unmistakable. Your welcome to forward my sighting to carlsagan.com, etc., get tired of rela! ting it or finding WHERE to. Still have an intense interest in cosmology, even more now although I think many cosmologists views would have or will change after seeing a thing like that from only 30 feet. Some friends may feel my Star Trek stories are more real in their view, I really have nothing to prove and don&#39;t care if they like astrophysics, x-files or Rael. I know I had the SETI screensaver for some time. I&#39;d just like to find out if anyone shared our sightings that night other than us, I&#39;d appreciate if you could in exchange for my story email it back to me so I don&#39;t have to keep going over it, I will have my official story reported and on file now, special thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Feel free to contact me for any further details, if some stuffed shirt gov&#39;t guys come having too many questions or something adverse you know, it might have been the planet Venus, just the planet Venus (chuckles) heh, heh if that&#39;s what they want people to think from their view, fine by me, I guess they just want people to have the feeling of security that &#34;only the air force controls the skies over the US&#34;, really don&#39;t care, someone going to give me too hard a time over it I&#39;ll just forget I saw anything same as Janis, big deal, sheez. Cheers, Malcolm &lt;*snip*&gt;  ------------------------------------------------------     UPDATES! May 03, 2006  Thank you very much, I can feel at peace now getting the story off my back, not knowing who to tell. I have the page bookmarked for reference, thanks. Only thing I might add, I felt it had peaceful vibes, because anything that advanced that meant harm could have done anything bad, although I woulden&#39;t recommend shooting at them like the air force. I think maybe what was up with the spotlight maybe they were making some kind of video starlog for their mothership maybe. I had thought I could have made some sort of hand signals like pounding my chest and pointing up to show I might like to go with them someday. I can&#39;t figure why people refuse to believe our sighting so much, conditioning perhaps, like in trying to suggest it was reflections of the planet Venus or something, I uh sure don&#39;t th9ink so. All I can say is if you see one close up like that from 30 feet or so, being so apparently unmistakable, remember I said they are out there for super real, wayn more than anything! fictional or imagined. I have the drawing in a storage in Orange Co., if I can ever dig it out someday I&#39;ll forward it, I think you all must know the variety of craft though, try freezing shots of the Canadian &#34;Guardian Saucers&#34;. Love your web site, hope this may be of help to your research and readers, thanks. Please though, if anyone saw that saucer that night please let me know, a whole library of books seems to suggest there wasen&#39;t, hmm.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Cheers, ((name deleted)) PS THERE IS A us AIRBASE IN THE VICINITY, JUST SOUTH OF THE TRUCK STOP.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The saucer was moving away slowly and then quickly glid across the skyline toward the west.  We ran inside and told our parents.  Of course no one believed us and it was a joke with my sisters for years.  After that I realized my parents didn&#39;t know everything.  About 15 years later I mentioned it to my brother as we hadn&#39;t spoken of it since the week it happened.  He just froze up and said, &#34;i&#39;m not supposed to talk about it.  They told me not to.&#34;  Although as a child I never doubted what I saw.  His odd behavior made me realize he was a troubled with it as I.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My friend and I were on our way to a weekly bowling night.  We were about one and half miles out of the town of Sutersville PA 15083 proceeding up Nickel&#39;s hill in his 1973 Ford XLT pickup when out of his left windshield we saw a large oval craft hovering over the tree line with oval to circle lights on the upper side of the undentified craft. It hovered over the tree line for about a minute and the lifted up and down the road toward the highest point of the country road where it met up with seven other crafts of smaller structure.<n> <n><n> <n><n> During the next tweleve minutes we obsevered various unusal manuvers in the sky and from horizon to horizon in a matter of minutes.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My friend and I were both in the military but not at that time.  He was in the AIR FORCE and I was in Navy.  I am now 55 years old now and I have never reported this before.  I have watched some of the Television shows about UFO&#39;s and some of the craft as seen by others was similiar to what I and my friend saw that night.<n>

Sometime between 1982 and 1984 I was driving out Route 2 every Friday night to Western MA to visit a friend in college, so I know it was not during the summer months.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night I was the only car on the road in the Ayer area which is pretty rural alot of trees and some houses on a 2 lane divided highway.  In the distance straight ahead of me was a single white light in the sky.  It looked about a mile away about 3/4 up the windshield I was approching it at about 50 MPH with my lights on because it was dark outside.  The craft was just hovering in one place dead ahead of me as I approached.<n> <n><n> <n><n> All of a sudden it shot to the south (my left) at a speed that we are not capable of, maybe 10,000 MPH. Now heres the proof that I know it was not made by man, it did not need any distance to get up to speed.  It was like moving at top speed instantaneously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have always wanted to know if anyone else ever saw it that night thats why I came to this site to look it up historically.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was not close enough to hear any sound<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At the time I was 19 years old, I lived Lozells, a suburb of Birmingham 2-3 miles from the city centre.  My place of employment was the 200 bedroom 3 star ‘Ladbroke Hotel’, Union Passage B2 4RX, I commenced employment there in June 1979 and left in January 1990. The hotel is now called the ‘Britannia Hotel’.  My first position there, as a school leaver, was as Hall Porter, when I resigned my position was Sales Manager, having held various managerial roles such as Reservations Manager and Front of House Manager.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had arranged to meet my cousin, Brian, at the Backyard Bar at the Grand Hotel, Colmore Row, Birmingham. I travelled to Birmingham City Centre on the 33 bus from Lozells.  It was a windy, drab dark early evening, I walked through Union Passage, the location of the ‘Ladbroke Hotel’,  late shoppers and workers going home were walking towards me, there is an overhead hotel signage canopy which obscures the skyline for approximately 15 yards, when the sky was visible I saw an enormous lit spherical shape in the sky, the typical flying saucer shape. Firstly, I was stunned and stared at the object for what seemed minutes, but probably was only seconds. My first inclination was to beckon to the people walking towards me, I said “Look at that”, there was no response from anyone, I repeated, “Look up there!”, still no response, I was getting frustrated that nobody was taking any notice of me so I kept repeating the request, eventually I realised that there was no sound coming out of ! my mouth.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I followed the object, still trying to get people to look at it, but everybody ignored me. I walked through Union passage, and turned left at Union Street; I crossed the road and stood almost directly outside ‘Rackham’s department store, Cherry Street. The object had moved to directly in front of me but probably 1-2 miles away. I stared in disbelief, and then the glowing object moved rapidly to my left and out of sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I returned to the Ladbroke Hotel to ask the on-duty Receptionist, Lin, if she has seen anything unusual also if any guests had reported the sighting, she said no and looked at me in disbelief.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following day (Wednesday) I was due to attend the wedding reception of my very good friends and colleagues, Gwynne and Richard at the ‘Yard of Ale’ public house in Birmingham city centre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I received a phone call at home from my cousin, Brian, he said “I’ve been trying to contact you, are you ok?”, I said, “I’m ok, I’m going to Gwynne’s and Richard’s wedding reception today, Brian replied, “It’s Thursday evening!”. I thought he was joking, so I turned on the TV and ‘Top of the Pops’ was on, (Thursday 7.30pm).<n> <n><n> <n><n> I felt confused, stood there for a while trying to understand what had happened, I had lost more than a complete day and missed the wedding of my good friends. I called them to explain, but I could not explain, I was forgiven, eventually.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years later in 1991, I worked for ‘Hilton National Hotels’ as ‘Front Office Development Manager’. My base at the time was the ‘Hilton National Hotel’, Farlington, Portsmouth; this is where I met my future wife Mary, an American from Colorado. Mary was a guest at the hotel; I checked her in and showed her to her room, she was in a wheelchair having suffered a serious car accident in London.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Within a week of meeting I asked Mary to marry me, she accepted and we moved to Rotherhithe London, moving to Ashby-de-la-Zouch a year later.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I told Mary of my ‘Union Passage’ experiences on many occasions, back in 1992 the Internet was a relatively new concept, but Mary, being from USA, was already experienced, she Emailed a UFO investigator, I think from Leicestershire or somewhere fairly local, can’t remember his name, he was interested in my experiences and a meeting was arranged at our house in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On the day in question Mary had organised tea and cakes etc. and I was eager to meet with the investigator. Everything was arranged, he was due to arrive early evening, I went upstairs to change clothes, sat on the edge of the bed, the door bell rang, Mary shouted up, “Steve, they’re here”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I cannot explain what happened next and still cannot to this day, I had ‘turned to stone’, I told Mary to send them away, I just could not move of the bed, I was embarrassed but there was nothing I could do, I felt controlled not to allow the conversation to take place, eventually they left the house, shouting up the stairs that they would come back with pleasure if I changed my mind, I never did, until now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m now 50 years old, looking back I realise that I had changed a lot after the experiences of 1983, nothing quite seemed the same again, I feel that I have had memory loss, time loss and a feeling of dread and intrusion, I have had dental problems but feel a total dread of anybody looking in my mouth, in fact it’s distressing for me to open my mouth wide. I cannot touch my navel anymore and since then digestive problems. When I’m alone I do not feel alone. I woke up during an appendix operation in 1985, I could feel the pain but I was unable to tell the surgeon, the same feeling I had when I saw the object in Union Passage. My friends recall incidents to me a few years after this experience; I cannot remember those years, I was responsible for 60+ members of staff but to me those years are mostly blank.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never experienced a ‘UFO’ again, I have told family and friends about my experiences, some believe me some don’t, it doesn’t really matter to me if they believe me or not. When I hear the stories in the media and the debates on whether ‘we are alone in the universe or not’ I feel a great sense of satisfaction in knowing that ‘I already know’.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Surely I cannot be the only person who experienced this in Birmingham in the early 80’s; I would be fascinated to hear from anyone who has had similar experiences during this time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks for listening.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Steve Welsh<n>
