There were no clouds. It was a beautiful starry night. I was gazing at the stars and suddenly a perfectly square shaped object appeared as if it was resting on the earth&#39;s atmosphere. It was milky white in color.<n> <n><n> <n><n> As I pointed to it, it suddenly zoomed across the sky leaving a faint white trail behind it. The trail could be seen for at least a minute if you knew where to look.  My companion could not see the trail.  The object appeared and disappeared so quickly, my companion did not have a chance to see it.  I just happened to be looking at the right place at the right time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never seen it again or any other unexplained objects since then and have never heard any reports anywhere of square shaped objects.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

7/23/82 19:00|Sweetwater|TN|Cylinder|10 minutes|A UFO sighting in Sweetwater, Tennessee in 1982, witnessed by many|7/17/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82455.html|3|ndxe198207| A UFO sighting in Sweetwater, Tennessee in 1982, witnessed by many<n> <n><n> <n><n> On our way back from Englewood, Tennessee, me, my parents and sister witnessed a UFO hovering over a pasture just above the tree lines.  Craft was about the length of a three football fields long and was black with small windows around the mid-section of the craft.  You could not hear any birds or any animal noises that you would normally hear in the country.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My parents took me and my sister home so they could go and see if they could see the craft any better from another area of the country.  My Parents told me to call the Airport to see if they had any missing blimps or aircraft in the area, which the conversation was recorded by the McGhee Tyson Airport Tower.  They gave me a number to call, but when I called it, it was a number to an institution for the crazy/insane.  I called them back to tell them this was no joke and it was very real.  I also know of others that lived in the same area, that also witnessed hearing a hovering sound over their residence and that their TV started making static sounds and they lost their picture but then a few seconds later, went back to normal.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen other UFO activity since then, up in the skies where they were flying irractically in the night sky back in 1988, in Maryville, Tennessee, while watching the stars at night.  My husband is not a believer of UFO&#39;s, but he could not explain the fast moving lights or what it could have been, since he is a Geographer and knows that stars can&#39;t move around like what he was seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I believe in UFO&#39;s and no one can convince me they do not exist.   I believe they are here to see how we react to unknown visitors and believe we are part of them in some way or another, but until we can be a peaceful nation, they will not present themselves because of our cruelty to others. If we show a more peaceful approach to unknown visitors, I beleive we can learn what we need to, to see why we are here and what our real purpose is for survival.  We can learn a lot from them, if given the chance to do so, and I hope that in my lifetime, we can have the opportunity to be friends with all the other unknowns in our Universe, because I believe they are others out there on Planets just like ours, that we haven&#39;t gotten to explore yet, but because of our limited education, many find it hard to accept that there is a higher being out there besides us, and they are out there, waiting for the right time to present themselves when we can accept that there is a more advance race than we will ever become for thousands of years down the road.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

7/23/82 01:00|Bowling Green|KY|Other|20 - Seconds|JFK FIGURE SEEN IN OUR WAL-MART|8/27/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/071/S71868.html|4|ndxe198207| JFK FIGURE SEEN IN OUR WAL-MART<n> <n><n> <n><n> My story is amazing to say the least, and you probably will not believe it and discard it, but it is very true.  It is the God&#39;s truth if I ever told it.  Another witness saw the same thing as I did at the same time that day.  I have waited for many years to offer this report to somebody, somewhere, anybody, who will hopefully understand where I am coming from.  No we are not crazy nor were we drinking.  I work for the U.S. Government now and I still today cannot comprehend exactly what we saw that day.  Years ago I worked in a Wal-Mart store as a Sales Manager, and one day I saw something inside that store that shocked me terribly, and that I shall never ever forget.  It still haunts and puzzles me today.  Neither will my other witness that I shall call JM.  JM was a Sales Manager for Wal-Mart like I was, and we were both standing inside our Wal-Mart store at around 1:00 PM after lunch when all of a sudden an older man, in his late sixties to early seventies, walked directly between us and never said a word.  He just stared at us both.  He had grey hair and wore a redish plaid shirt of some kind.  JM and I just stood there shocked at what we saw, and when I tell you &#34;what&#34; we saw you will be shocked too.  We both just stared at him and our jaws were dropped open wide.  You see, this man looked &#34;exactly&#34; like an older President John F. Kennedy.  We both saw it for ourselves.  But that wasn&#39;t what shocked us the most.  The man had a long scar running all the way down the right side of his face and into his skull.  This &#34;whatever&#34; had been shot or injured with a huge wound all the way around the right side of his skull.  The scars were there to prove it, and he had been sewn up with many stitches.  We were both shocked and stunned to say the least.  The man passed us and then I finally said to JM, &#34;Did you just see what I saw?&#34;  And JM said, &#34;Yes, but I don&#39;t believe it.&#34;  We then went looking for this man and he was simply gone! in an instant.  We saw an individul that day who was an older! JFK, a spirit, MIB, or an alien.  This President John F. Kennedy man combed his hair the same way JFK did, had the visible scars on the right side of his head were positioned the same as JFK&#39;s were after he was assassinated on November 22, 1963.  I have seen some of JFK&#39;s autoposy photograhps.  The facial features were exactly the same too.  He looked at us both as if he wanted us to notice him.  I hope you will not think that we are &#34;cooks&#34; of some kind.  I have seen several UFOs and other strange things before, and I &#34;did&#34; see this too.  The UFOs are real, and I have seen the proof.  I wasn&#39;t looking to see anything strange that day either.  I am a Christian, and attend Church regularly and I believe in Jesus Christ.  We know for sure what we both saw that day and it still lingers in our minds.  As a Historian, I have heard several stories about JFK and his knowlege of UFOs.  This man, whoever or whatever he was, makes me wonder.  This is a very true and accurate story-it really ! happened.  I do wish to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution at seeing this!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the time of the sighting is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/22/82 20:30|Grass Valley|CA|Other|45 seconds|Spectrum of bright colored rings reasembling a bull's eye|1/31/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34711.html|5|ndxe198207| In the summer of 1983 on a partial cloudy night around 8:30 PM, my cousin and I had a frightful experience, mine more frightful and unshakeable than hers. I was but twelve years old, my cousin two years older, and as we walked down to the gated community&#39;s (Lake of the Pines) clubhouse, we noticed the dogs that night barked more than what one would consider to be normal.  It was on our return home at 8:30 PM that we both looked up into the night sky, and there passing between the break in clouds directly overhead from west to east ,making no sound, a long oblong shaped craft that would dwarf a conventional 747 aircraft.  Located at the front of the craft on its side, a spectrum of bright colored rings reasembling a bull&#39;s eye. As the craft had passed we noticed that the dogs began to bark again, for all was quiet in that 45 seconds as it passed overhead.  We also became aware after it was over, that neither one of us told the other to look up at the exact same time, at the exact same spot in the sky, we just did. My cousin has put this behind her, regarding it as a strange event.  But my dreams of strange symbols and equations that make no sense to me, has never left my mind from that night forward.  It helps my well-being to speak of this for the first time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

A car was heard travelling at high speed through country lanes, the only car heard that night. We all expected a police car chase but no other vehicle emerged from the country side. Within seconds we all saw a glowing green fireball travelling at what seemed a slow pace. We watched it for approx&#39; three mins&#39; during which it made no sound. It was guessed that it was about a mile away from us. The object travelled horizontally (east to west I think). The next day we all checked the local news papers for any reports, nothing was reported.<n>

It was a very hot quite dark night. We stopped in awe as a craft went over head you could &#39;feel&#39; it go over but it never made a sound was triangular in shape , no flashing lights just a dim glow at it&#39;s edges. It passed over very slowly almost stopping and disappeared over the tree tops. Our truck radio cut out until it was out of sight. Later that evening we saw at least a hundred aircraft , planes and helicopters criss cossing the area and direction that it had taken.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

One of the other kids looked up and said hay whats that,and we all looked to where he was pointing.What i seen was a large dark colored v shaped craft,with 5 sets of lights on it&#39;s under side.The five sets of lights where in groups of three in a triangle pattern,with one group of three lights at the front of the craft and the other groups going down the two sides of the v shape.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am the kind of person that remembers every thing, so my estimate of the size of the craft would be 300 ft wing span and around 200 ft in length.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We heard no sound at all and it appeared to be only a few hundred feet above the tree tops directly over the crescent street extension, we were very close to it, i could see the bottom of the craft and it looked a lot like what our modern stealth bombers look like, with a flat black paint look, and different lines that seem to outline access panels.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft just hovered there for about 2 minutes as we all watched in awe, then it slowly started moving south directly over my house then the millers river, all the time it seemed to keep the exact same altitude following the land as if it was locked into some kind of gps that kept it exactly the same height off the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We watched it go down over the river and then back up the other side, then it went up over stans auto body shop and then the jr high school then out of our range of site.the whole time we were walking around for the best position to see it from,so we all got an eye full.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At one point i was directly under it so i seen it well and will never forget it.It displayed flight characteristics i have never seen from any stealth craft. in the way that it just hovered there, and remained completely silent even though i was that close to it ,also when it did move it moved so slow that it could not have been held in the air by normal aerodynamics,it just didn&#39;t move fast enough to generate any lift.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Once it was on the other side of the river we could see the side profile a bit better, and there was nothing significant there, just more dark flat black like the bottom,and i would say it was about 10 feet thick,that is,if it were on the ground it would be 10 feet tall. The back of the craft did seem to be an exhaust of some kind, and it looked glowing hot ,but i heard no sound,and the glow was blue not red like i would expect from a jets after burners.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have seen this story on the television show unsolved mystery&#39;s,and those witnesses described it as five planes flying in formation,i can see why they would think that because the lights on the bottom did make it look like 5 plans in formation.But i got real close so i can tell you it was one solid object for sure.but i do believe we seen the same thing, myself and those people in new york that were on unsolved mystery&#39;s<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were at about the seven thousand foot level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The stars were very bright that night, and it was clear. I spotted a very bright light moving slowly and steadily in the sky, from east to west. I pointed it out to my friend and we watched it as it moved along. I would estimate the object&#39;s altitude at more than thirty miles.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We thought it was a satellite.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Without warning, the object made an instantaneous right-angle turn and continued in a northerly direction. We watched it until it disappeared over the horizon.

7/18/82 15:30|Mountian View|CA|Cylinder|15 seconds|Matelic cylindrical object sighted from Navy P3 Orion from above, houvering near Lookeed instalation.|1/22/04|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/034/S34550.html|11|ndxe198207| Matelic cylindrical object sighted from Navy P3 Orion from above, houvering near Lookeed instalation.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was in the Navy reserve from 78 through 85. I was an AE3-Aviation Electrican&#39;s mate third class and was attached to a P3 squadren at NAS Moffett Field in Mountain View CA. I was later, after graduation, selected to attend Aviation Offer&#39;s Candate School, Pensacola FL. I was living in Pasadena at the time, and was utilizing our P3 anti submarine aircraft as an airlift to my duty station once a month from southern CA.<n> <n><n> <n><n> At the time I was a student pilot, with about 70 hours on the books and countless hundreds of hours flying &#34;dead head&#34; on board Navy aircraft and general aviation aircraft. I have been around aircraft all of my life. My father was an accomplished pilot, and at times we owned two aircraft when I was a youngster.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The sighting occured shortly after takeoff from NAS Moffett Field enroute to Yuma AZ and then over to Burbank CA where I was to disembark. I was not an official part of the flight crew on this flight but I always managed to stay bussy helping the crew, listening to radio transmissions and playing with the inertial nav equipment.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were under condition Five, meaning we were all to be strapped in in spacific places until the skipper called condition two. I was seated on the floor,strapped to the bulkhead, facing backwards on the left side of the airplane. Next to me was the emergency over wing  exit door that had a window in it, offering a great view of anything passing behind the wing, and with almost an unlimited visibility up forward and to the rear.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We had taken off to the North and executed a long 180 degree climbing turn to the South. We were climbing through about 6,500 th 8,500 for flight level-2300. (Turboprops do best around that level.) I was curiously looking out my window, and I could see San Jose airport about 10 to 15 miles to the east. Beneith us was Santa Clara I believe, with residential, and commericial type of development. Suddenly, and I do mean suddenly I spotted &#34;what appeared to be&#34; a metallic cylinder houvering just slightly below our altitude off to our left.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now I say houvering for a reason. As someone who flew many hours in both left and right seats, I developed this uncanny ability, as do all pilots to judge distances, proportions speeds-energy states, even direction utilizing visual skills most people never develop. It&#39;s almost like a kinsthetic ability you develop when you fly a lot. Additionally I think I should add here that my eyesight then was better than 20:20 in both eyes, and my color comprehension was off the scale, and my depth perception was flawless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> With that, here Is what I preceived. Again the cylender appeared to have no motion, only a relitive motion to us. If it was moving, it was moving very slowly. I guessed its distance from us to be less than one mile and perhaps as close as a quartes mile. Either way, it was way, way too close for confort, especially since he was not in communication with Oakland flight watch nor was he transponding-obviously.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I estimated the size of the &#34;craft&#34; to be between 20 and 40 feet high and between 7 and 13 feet in diameter, a ratio of about 3 to 1, heighth to diameter. Again, it was slightly below us, and again depending on the actual distance I am guessing he was only 100 to 300 feet lower, but not more than that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was no one near me, and we were under condition five so there wasn&#39;t anything I could do to get another whitness. The object dissappeared behind and below the horizontal stablizer after about 15 seconds of observation by me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Not only was this thing matellic, but it looked like chrome, like a merror. Infact I was surprized I spotted it as it blended so well into the suroundings. From below it would be very difficult to see.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I should add that Moffett Field was located right next to Lookheeds major instalation, with satelite tracking stations and all sorts of facilities. That compound is like a small city un to itself. May be this was one of thiers, or the Russians, who knows. All I know is that I saw it and for some strange reason I haven&#39;t told very many people.<n> <n><n> <n><n> There was one very strange thing that I should report in reference to this sighting, and it is strange.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The moment I saw this thing, and once I got a fix on it, ie its size,speed distance and all of that, I got the strongest feeling from deep inside myself that &#34;I was not suposed to be seeing this.&#34; It was almost like a voice in my head had stated that to me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I was out side seeing how many of teh star shapes I could make out the big dipper, ect. I had looked to my right at a rather large hill that the road that runs in front of the apartment house.  A ball of light came over the hill i&#39;m guessing was  about  50 to 70 feet in the air moving very slowly.  I watched it for a few mins an noticed that none of the &#34;sounds&#34; you would hear in the country had stopped and there was absolutly no noise from the object.  I had ran into the house to get my sister and her then husband and we all watched it seem to slow down even more for a breef moment, then continued its path from the south to the north (more or less) As we had no phone in the house at the moment there was no way of contacting anyone else to what we saw.  We were watching it move out of site for about 45 mins untill we could not see it any longer, I was quite supprized the distance we were able to see the light flashing from so far away as it was.  (not sure if this is important or not but, The very next day, I had seen a red bi-plane following a sillilar course as the ball of light I had seen the night before but I could hear that from inside the house, the object had made no nose and was about 100 to 150 feet away as it passed us as we watched it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We started to walk twards is .we could not tell how close or far it was.Then after about 2 min it changed to a ball again .And moved staight up and stoped then over like at a 45deg angle at a speed so fast a plane would brake apart.then disapeard .We spent the next night out ther again to see if it will come back but it never did .

Around 11:00 pm (23:00 hours) we noticed lights over the lake. At first we though it was barge traffic. We noted that the lights were moving towards the near shore and not up lake as barges usually do. We knew that something was very different when the lights came ashore.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The craft was approxamately 600 yards from our position and slightly below us, we were atop a ridge looking down. The object was triangular in shape, black with lights on each corner that changed through the entire spectuum every 3 to 5 seconds. The top of the object was very slighthly pyramidal in shape. The object was roughly 200 feet on a side, with the top raising about 10 feet in the center. There were several &#34;ports&#34; on the top of the craft through which we could see movement backlit by blue lights. Occasionaly a beam of light would be emitted from under the craft and illuminate the ground under the ship.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object hovered in palce over the clearing for almost 40 minutes. It was almost in a &#34;station keeping&#34; mode and drifted no more than 20 feet from it&#39;s original position. It was silent for the most part, we occasionally heard a low humming sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about 45 minutes we noted it rising vertically. It rose very slowly at first, at an altitude of roughhly 500 feet it began to accelerate, still verticaly. Over the next minute it shot straight skyward, dissaperaing from sight directly overhead. It never made a sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We observed the craft with naked eyes, binoculars, and attempted photography with a 400 mm lens. We could observe the craft with through the camera, but all photos were badly &#34;overexposed&#34;, the entire roll of film was a loss.<n> <n><n> <n><n> To this day we seldom speak of the exprience and still cannot explain what we saw.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

They were side by side with the craft farthest from us displaying a wobbling motion (rocking wing tip to wing tip). The aprox. speed was 50-60 mph.

After visiting your site I thought it might be a good opportunity to share it with others who have had experiences with UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was during the summer of 1982. My highschool buddy (we were both 17 at the time) and I were just arriving at his father&#39;s home. It was getting pretty late (just after 9:00 pm), but there still was some sunlight in the sky. His father lived in the west side, upper floor of a fourplex. The unit was quite high and you had to take the stairs up to the second level.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While walking up the stairs my friend pointed west and said &#34;Look, a ufo!&#34; I looked in that direction and could not see anything. There was a large tree next to the home and between us and the ufo. he pointed at the object again and I still could not see it. I asked him to describe the object. He told me it was a large glowing redish/orange ball and it was moving up, then across the sky.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note that Kelowna is located in a valley which holds a large lake. The main city center is on the east side of the lake. The area that we were located was near the downtown core or only a kilometer east of the lake. My friend indicated that the glowing ball appeared to be over the lake, or at least 1 1/2 km from where we were.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object disappeared and I remember being so disappointed I didn&#39;t get a look at it. Especially because my friend said he had seen it so clearly. From there, we both climbed onto the high roof and began to watch the sky as it darkened.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We layed on the roof which faced West for quite awhile (approx - 1/2 - 45 minutes)seeing nothing. Just before we were to head into the house I saw something that I could barely believe.<n> <n><n> <n><n> High in the sky, there was a formation of faint triangular shaped objects flying across the sky. (There was very light cloud cover, however they were definitely above the clouds.) They gave off a faint white light and were moving from South West to North East. They weren&#39;t moving very fast at all however all of a sudden you&#39;d see one of the objects leave the formation at an incredible speed and sweep away. It would take angles at such a high speeds that flying aircraft that I have seen could  never make. (not even fighter jets.)  For the next 15 minutes triangular shaped objects joined or left the formation. I was simple astonished by the ease the objects moved at such speeds. When they rejoined the formation they would swoop in and stop in perfect position.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I regularily asked my friend what he was seeing and he repeated exactly what I had just saw. Once I got up and contacted a local radio station to see if anyone else was witnessing what we were seeing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Soon the formation moved out of sight. We stayed around for another 1/2 or so. We saw a few more triangular objects moving back and forth through the sky. (Some in formation with each other, say two to four objects.)  After it was all over my friend and I just sat and talked about this experience. We have never seen anything like it since.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to have his friend submit a report, as well.  Very interesting report, we believe.  PD))<n>

It had lights going all the way around it and had a metalic apperance. This happpened when I was 10 or 11 and I have never since seen anything strange in the sky but this I know was not of anything I can explain to this day.(note: Out in the booneys, Nearest neihbor &gt; 1 mile away.

Two families of us, with kids, were spending a weekend at a VERY rustic resort in the Cascade Mountains, many miles N.E. of Burlington/Mt. Vernon.  The resort shuts off its power at 10 p.m., so most everyone went to bed.  My stepson (he was 12)and I went to sit on the beach above the lake and were just talking and watching the sky for &#34;shooting stars&#34;.  Now and then we&#39;d see a satellite pass.  I might note that the sky was clear, stars very bright, as the lake runs for miles in a north-south direction with mountains jutting high on the sides ... no lights other than Nature&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway, one of us points out what we thought was another satellite, but moving a bit slower and with a slight coloration to it .. I want to say a mottled orange.  It came from the east, and as we watched, it would have passed directly east/west, when it suddenly changed direction 90 degrees and passed over us going due north.  What was a mind blower at the time is that it never changed speed, but made the turn while maintaining velocy.  It disappeared over the horizon to the north.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We joked about the aliens being all jammed into one corner of their ship from some neophyte driver&#39;s hard right turn, as he wanted to go visit Santa Claus.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Virtually no man-made satellites travel from east to west.  If, in fact, that was the direction the object was traveling, and the witness seems certain of that fact, then the object almost certainly could not have been an artificial, I.e. man-made, satellite.

I was there with a guy named ((name deleted--male)) and his girlfriend ((name deleted--female)).  Unfortunately, I can&#39;t remember their last names and don&#39;t know if I could even find them these days as I live in Missouri now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Anyway we had laid out a blanket and were laying side-by-side stargazing when I saw what looked like a normal satellite tracking in a straight line from east to west across the sky.  I pointed it out to the others and everyone acknowledged that they saw it too.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When it got directly above us it suddenly did a fast, tight loop, seemingly around a bright star exactly above us.  At that moment all three of us received a very strong mental impression that I can only describe as a telepathic message directly from this object.  I know this was real because we compared our experiences and all three of us felt the same thing and received the same &#34;information&#34;.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Then the light continued in a straight line until it went over the horizon.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Now the important thing about this experience is the &#34;message&#34; or &#34;impression&#34; we all received from the object which I will describe the best I can.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This object was a group of beings that were aware of us watching them and they timed their loop maneuver somehow so it would seem to us that they had looped around a star.  Of course this star was millions of miles away so these beings had some way of seeing themselves through our eyes or maybe calculating everything perfectly, distance and angle and such.  They did the loop just to amaze us in a playful, humorous way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We all had the impression that these beings were beneficial and had a sense of humor.  At the same time, the beings imparted to us a very strong impression that they were watching over all of us on this planet and not to worry, they weren&#39;t going to let anything really bad happen like us destroying ourselves or something.  We were hit with a very nice sense of calm and well-being.  This feeling was very profound and life-changing for me; I can&#39;t speak for my companions after all these years but at the time they were just as deeply affected as I was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The loop this &#34;craft&#34; made was so fast and perfect as to be impossible for even the fastest airplane to do.  We all had the same impression that the &#34;craft&#34; was more of a ball of energy then an actual physical ship, the energy ball was a conglomeration of at least several beings traveling in a group.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I&#39;ve had the opinion since this experience that the &#34;visitors&#34; are capable of existing as pure energy and have no need of an actual craft.  This is why I don&#39;t put a lot of faith in most sightings I hear about that describe metallic craft and the like.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I also really don&#39;t have a lot of faith in the &#34;abduction&#34; phenomena that is widely reported, I don&#39;t see the need these beings would have to actually physically abduct people since they are so far advanced they probably know everything they need to know about us just by sensing it somehow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have only told a few prople about this in passing over the years and I really don&#39;t care who believes me.  But what happened was real and I don&#39;t know why they chose to contact us in this way or to impart this information to us, maybe they were just having some fun.  I hope this is something you can use.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Note: I am not a mental patient nor have I ever had any type of mental or phychological episodes whatsoever.  I&#39;m a down-to-earth guy who owns a small farm and is 49 years old at this time.

At some point, we became aware of a gigantic light (with no sound, only silence and the waves) filling our little bay, as if an incredibly huge spotlight (or gigantic ball of light) was shining on it -  I say &#34;became aware&#34; because oddly enough, our awareness of this light - something so extraordinary as to warrant a seriously excited response I should think - elicited in us at first no response or comment, as if we saw this kind of thing everyday, and it was almost in passing that I finally asked my friend if she noticed this huge light shining in front of us. She said she did and we simply continued to sit there and stare at it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This huge light should have lit up the pier and the rocks on either side of it, but really didn&#39;t - it just lit up the water as if the light were somehow localized or focused on the water. I think I recall mentioning this odd &#34;light behavior&#34; to my friend while sitting on the beach and incredibly enough, I think she may have said something like, &#34;It must be the sun&#34; - which was a ridiculous thing to say when it&#39;s nighttime, and this out-of-character (in that it was absurd) comment from a girl who was an impressive student, high achiever and is now a doctor.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don&#39;t know if the light was there when we walked onto the beach and sat down (I don&#39;t remember doing that either), and have no memory of seeing the light emerge from the darkness - it was simply &#34;there&#34; by the time we &#34;noticed&#34; it and I thought to ask my friend if she too was seeing it. So after a time - it may have been 5 minutes or an hour or 3 hours (I just don&#39;t have any idea of the time), I said that it was odd that no one else was out on the beach looking at this (it was impossible not to see it if you were awake - it was that huge and the houses on the beach were right next to each other, with 10 houses directly facing the bay and the light). I decided to get up and go wake up my brother to show him, as the light was constant and didn&#39;t seem to be going anywhere, and it seemed to have been there a long time.<n> <n><n> <n><n> So I walked up the beach, walked up the beach stairs to the top of our seawall and just as I reached the top, the light rose up, traveled to directly over my head, stayed there for a beat and then split into two smaller lights which then shot off in opposite directions. And that was that. It was gone.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I walked back to the beach and my friend still sitting there and attempted to talk with her about it and she turned to me and said &#34;I don&#39;t ever want to talk about this again.&#34; And she walked home down the beach. And we never mentioned it again. In fact, I never told anyone until about 10 years later. Not because I was worried about what anyone would think, but because it didn&#39;t (oddly enough again) seem &#34;newsworthy&#34; or &#34;interesting,&#34; which, of course, it absolutely was.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The following morning, no one else in our neighborhood mentioned it, either. Perhaps they didn&#39;t see it, or like me, didn&#39;t find it &#34;newsworthy.&#34; Another odd thing is that my friend and I were only 14. Neither of us was allowed out on the beach (or anywhere) alone at midnight (my best guess as to time, as no one was awake in the neighborhood), and my friend&#39;s parents were especially strict. Her summer curfew was about 9 pm back then. I find it odd that we were even out there at that time, that neither of us were &#34;missed&#34; while we were out, that no one came looking for us, that neither of us got caught or got in trouble for being out of the house so late at night, and that no one else in our crowded little area saw this. From the light, to our reaction, to even our presence there on the beach, the whole thing could not be stranger.<n> <n><n> <n><n> About 10 years later, I was riding in the car with my fiancee, and was reading a book about UFO sightings. A description of a sighting in the book was almost identical to the experience I&#39;d had and I read it to him and told him that I had witnessed something similar. We had been together for 7 years at that point and when he asked me why I&#39;d never mentioned it before, I was truly puzzled and wondered myself why I hadn&#39;t mentioned it to him or anyone before that. In fact, I&#39;ve considered filling out your form many times before and haven&#39;t, because I didn&#39;t think it was really of interest, but now that I have finally written it down, it does seem quite a strange and maybe even amazing event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I walked over to the window, opened the sheer curtains, and saw very clearly a disc-shaped UFO with 6-8 multi- colored lights hanging beneath the disk. The colored lights alternated their lighting pattern, as if spinning in a slow circle.  The sound matched the moving lights.  The ship wasn&#39;t doing anything other than hovering above the rooftops.  I tried to wake up my spouse verbally, to no avail.  I didn&#39;t dare leave the window.  After what seemed like an eternity, I finally did walk across the room to try again to rouse my spouse.  Unsuccessful, I returned to the window, only to find it was gone.  I watched the news reports for days for any similar reports, as sightings were common in the Texas Gulf Coast area.  But no one has ever confirmed this sighting to me.  My life changed after that point, though.  Strange, albeit harmless phenomenon continue to follow me even to this day.<n>

My sister and I were jumping skip orpe on the patio deck. It was a summer night and the air was partly cloudy. There were stars above us. When it happened I was not too sure of what to make of it. I pointed up to the bright white light that seemed to creep out of the clouds and hover above the tree tops. It hovered there. I remember saying to my sister, &#34;What is that!&#34; And it seemed that my arm froze midair and I am unable to say if lots of time went by...thats the confusing part...I do not know what happened at the time it seems to have been a normal thing...but thinking back now it seems a bit odd to have been unable to move. When I was able to move..I saw it creep back into the cloud and rest behind there while we were freaking out. Being small children we rushed back into the house and told our mother to come outside and look at what we saw...the light glowed from behind the clouds and seemed to move. No one could make out what it really was...it is a mystery today. However throughout my life after that night I have had many strange things that have happened to me. My sister refused to discuss that night!<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

She wanted to go to the store so the two of us walked about 2 blocks over to the local bodega. We were walking back and for some reason, I caught myself looking down at the ground. I remembered being told not to look down, and so I shifted my eyes to the horizon. It did occur to me to not only look at the horizon, but to check out the stars while I was at it. We were crossing the street, and I looked straight up as far as I could see. Suddenly, I tugged at my mother&#39;s hand and pulled her further into the street; &#34;Look, Look!&#34; I shouted as she pulled back on me. What I saw in that moment was a HUGE metal disk with bright lights all over it. It was suddenly hovering right over us. You could not see the sky it was so close. When she looked up, she yanked me back with the most chilling grasp, close to her waistline. I can still hear the desparate breath she took. Once I shouted look and was yanked back, I noticed everyone in the street stopped and was staring up at the sky. Once I looked back up again, it was gone, and everyone started walking again as if nothing had happened. The next day, when I went outside I heard nothing of the incident from adults. I knew of the news at the time, but was too young to understand what time it came on t.v.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Years had passed and I never forgot what happened, but as I aged I began to question if it was a dream. My mom and I had never discussed it after that night. I approached her one day and asked her if it was true we had seen a UFO. She sounded annoyed and said &#34;Yes!&#34; (she is not fond of such topics). I told her I did not beleive her, she was just trying to appease me, and asked her to recount her story. Here is what she said: &#34;I looked up and saw the UFO and lights, I was scared so I pulled you closer.&#34; I told her that when she pulled me closer, I looked around at everyone else looking up. I asked her what happened in that moment because when i looked back up the ufo was gone. &#34;The UFO ascended into the air, and sped off, like a bright white light, it just disappeared. It went up and out.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))<n>
7/1/82 19:00|Rock Hill|SC|Cigar||long cigar shaped UFO|4/14/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69454.html|31|ndxe198207| long cigar shaped UFO<n> <n><n> <n><n> I got a real good look at this cigar shaped UFO. It was a hot summer evening and i had just finished supper with my parents. As i left their home to go back to my appartment,i had come up to this stop sign to take a right turn.(I was 5 minutes from their home)I made a right turn and looked over in this field to my right that had cattle in it. I looked up and saw this round light greenish milky white light. I stopped my car and thought to myself, WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT? I leaned over toward my passenger seat and just watched to see what it was going to do. It was about 50 to 75 feet off the ground and looked like a long cigar with no wings or tail,and was dark colored with a round light on the front,like a flash light would have . As i kepted my eyes on it i could see what appeared to be heat coming off the sides of it,and it had a faint humming sound,plus it kinda vibrated as it was moving. It was moving real slow. Anyway, i couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it, and then all of a sudden it just disapeared right before my eyes.Like the blink of an eye, it was gone. I thought to myself then, WHERE DID IT GO? So then i turned my car around and came back to my parents house to tell them what i had seen. They told me that they have never seen a UFO, but there could be some out there. So i left and started back home and decieded to stop at the people&#39;s house who owned that piece of property to tell them what i had seen. I wanted them to know in case something had happened to any of their cattle. Well finially when i got home and ready for bed, because i had to go to work the next morning. I heard this humming, buzzing sound over the top of my appartment building. I thought to my self, oh no that UFO followed me home. I grabed my little dog and covered both of us up with the covers. I was scared then. Well the next three days i was in a complete daze.I felt really weird, like i wasn&#39;t all together there. After the third day of being in a fog. I awoke in the middle of my sleep and set up in my bed! and kin da sceamed.After i screamed, i saw this bright light flash across my bedroom and right out the window it went. I was back to normal, the foggy feelings i was experiencing had left me.<n>

My uncle emailed me this site and asked me to send this to you. I had an experience as a young teenager that was quite amazing. My brother and I was at my grandparents small farm playing in the driveway when we seen a large light to the east in the sky approx the distance that you would spot a small aircraft. It was a large and distinct light that stopped us in our tracks to stare. As we stared at the light it slowly made its way to the north not changing distance or altitude. We watched as it made its way from due east to due north. As we continued to stare it started to appear as though it was coming towards us. The light continued to come closer and yet did not change mass but became remarkably close. When the light stopped approaching it was approx 50 yards from where we were standing. It was directly behind a mature pecan tree and the light was as large as the entire tree. It stayed in that position for at least five minutes and then slowly started to back away. As it was backing away it was gaining altitude. When it got back to the distance it was before approaching us it started to go upwards and we watched it disappear into the distance in aprrox 30 seconds. The light did not make any noise nor did it create any shadows or brighten the area around it or where we were. I would guess the experience lasted at least 20 to 30 minutes. We of course told our grandparents and odd enough it took little to convince them of what we had seen. My grandfather told us that his neighbor that lived about 1/4 of a mile to the south had described the exact experience that happened to him only at an earlier date. I have not heard of anyone else having a similar experience in that area or any area for that matter ever since. I of couse have no ideal what it was but maybe you have heard of an experience like this before. I have heard of people sighting things that they could not explain but for something that came that close and was that distinct for! such a long period of time was nothing short of amazing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I give you my assurance that this was no hoax or made up event. It has been an event that has been discussed amongst my family for over 20 years which is why my uncle asked me to send this to you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
